that in making a routine traffic stop the police can permit a trained dog to sniff the car for drugs without the need for any particular reason to suspect the driver of a narcotics violation the 6to2 decision set aside a ruling by the illinois supreme court which held in 2003 that a state trooper who had stopped a man for speeding had broadened the scope of the encounter beyond constitutional limits by having the dog sniff the car the dog alerted the police to the trunk which contained 250000 worth of marijuana the addition of the dog impermissibly turned a traffic stop into a drug

kerry max cook played by aidan quinn below the case  mr cook was twice found guilty and sentenced for the 1977 killing of linda jo edwards in 1996 the texas court of criminal appeals reversed his second conviction and ordered another trial saying that prosecutorial and police misconduct has tainted this entire matter from the outset mr cook instead agreed to plead no contest to a murder charge in exchange for time served the critique  david e dobbs the prosecutor who handled the 1996 plea deal but was not involved in the earlier misconduct said the plea accurately reflected the facts he is unequivocally guilty of this crime mr dobbs said gary gauger played by brian dennehy below the case  in 1993 mr gauger was convicted of killing his parents the year before the trial judge initially sentenced him to death but later reduced the sentence to life in prison in 1996 an appeals court ordered that he be retried ruling that some incriminating statements mr gauger had made during many hours of questioning should not have been presented to the jury because police officers did not have cause to arrest him prosecutors instead dropped the charges and members of the outlaws a motorcycle gang confessed to the murders the critique  in 2003 a federal appeals court judge in chicago richard a posner summarized some of the facts in an interim ruling in mr gaugers civil suit for false arrest the absence of signs of forced entry or a struggle he wrote together with gaugers suspicious behavior and statements the financial benefit to him of his parents death his share of their estate was several hundred thousand dollars and his acknowledgment that members of the outlaws motorcycle gang had been occasional customers of his fathers motorcycle shop has left a lingering suspicion that he was somehow complicit robert hayes played by david brown jr below the case  in 1991 mr hayes was sentenced to death for strangling a coworker at the pompano harness track in 1995 the florida supreme court reversed his conviction and ordered a retrial saying that some of the dna evidence used to convict mr hayes was not reliable while evidence exists in this case to establish that hayes committed this offense the court ruled physical evidence also exists to establish that someone other than hayes committed the offense at the retrial in 1997 the jury heard evidence that mr hayess dna was found inside the victim pamela albertson and also that hairs found clutched in her hand were inconsistent with those of mr hayes he was acquitted the critique  the acquittal on retrial was based on reasonable doubt not actual innocence said ward a campbell a supervising deputy state attorney general in sacramento who has studied cases of people released from death row delbert tibbs played by delroy lindo below the case  in 1975 mr tibbs was sentenced to death for murdering terry milroy and to life for raping cynthia nadeau two florida hitchhikers the only evidence against him was ms nadeaus testimony the next year the florida supreme court reversed his conviction and granted him a new trial saying there was a very real possibility that tibbs had nothing to do with these crimes years passed as appeals courts considered whether a retrial should be barred as double jeopardy in 1982 the united states supreme court ruled that a retrial was appropriate soon afterward prosecutors dropped the case the critique  joseph dalessandro a state attorney told the florida commission on capital cases in 2002 that ms nadeau had progressed from a marijuana smoker to a crack user and i could not put her up on the stand so i declined to prosecute he added tibbs in my opinion was never an innocent man wrongfully accused he was a lucky human being he was guilty he was lucky and now he

interview for hbos real sports with bryant gumbel i have used you know marijuana moss is quoted as saying in a transcript of the show which is scheduled to run tuesday night but as far as abusing it and you know letting it take control over me i dont do that no a summer too darn hot for real work for much of the summer its been too hot to do any real work bakingly hot you might say so here are 20 halfbaked ideas for columns i might have actually written in a cooler season 1 dumb backtoschool stuff  im not sure what this has to do with new jersey but some marketing outfit sent me a boxful of new products for the fashionable student most ridiculous among them papermate antibacterial pens yes antibacterial pens but note antibacterial technology is designed to protect the pens surface and

being sold at stand after stand unattractive bods on the beach ugh shut it down 4 new jersey the obtuse state  not long ago two state assemblymen jon m bramnick and gordon m johnson introduced a resolution encouraging us to treat one another civilly but in my experience our biggest problem isnt the occasional raising of the middle finger its that average new jerseyans seem incapable of recognizing their own thoughtless behavior or that it might affect people around them case in point a newspaper columnist is riding the train into the city the people in the seat in front of him have a boy maybe 3 years old who apparently has never been on a train and who has one of those earsplitting kiddie voices inexplicably they let him hang over the seat back and look out the columnists window for the entire hourlong trip during which he continually shouts mommy look at that directly into the columnists face at a distance of two feet 5 new jerseyans not as bright as washingtonians  in washington where i once lived everyone who rides the subway seems to have mastered a simple escalator rule stand to the right so that people in a hurry  neurosurgeons with patients waiting on the operating table for instance  can scurry up the left side but on the new jersey transit platforms at penn station in new york the first two arriving new jerseyans to reach a given escalator will stop dead side by side theyll thereby clog the way for hundreds of people behind them causing the deaths of countless neurosurgery patients these same two people at the top of the escalator will take one step and again stop dead to discuss where to eat lunch while behind them the escalator continues to disgorge fellow passengers who having no room to exit are ground up like hamburger in the stairways

bush administrations habit of politicizing its scientific agencies was on display again this week when the food and drug administration for no compelling reason unexpectedly issued a brief poorly documented statement disputing the therapeutic value of marijuana the statement was described as a response to numerous inquiries from capitol hill but its likely intent was to buttress a crackdown on people who smoke marijuana for medical purposes and to counteract state efforts to legalize the practice ordinarily when the fda addresses a thorny issue it convenes a panel of experts who wade

when drawing wasnt an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise to apply ones craft to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works the best example  and the most

this show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection despite the veil of secrecy a couple of things are obvious the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser or both the works span more than 400 years from the 16th to the early 20th century and include drawings in ink and pencil watercolor chalk and gouache the earliest works come from a period when drawing wasnt an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise to apply ones craft to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works the best example  and the most historically significant work here  is a black chalk drawing the dead christ 152935 by agnolo bronzino with more than 90 drawings in the show being a diligent observer

abstract expressionism its hard to fault an exhibition that features prints by masters like mr johns and mr rauschenberg but given the somewhat precarious position of prints in the contemporary art

painting during the period it was supposed to be dead the shows 42 works by 37 artists reveal that far from dead painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic social and political turbulence of the times the alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it which makes for clear installation also tidies up history the main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story too much of this work
