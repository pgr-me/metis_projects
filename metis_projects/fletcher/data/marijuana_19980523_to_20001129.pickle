VJohn Stossel, libertarians' gift to television, takes up the cause tonight of people who are being punished for ''victimless crimes.'' They include pornographers, drug users and sellers, gamblers, ticket scalpers, prostitutes, homosexuals and sufferers in search of help in committing suicide. It's a brisk tour that in pursuit of the theme of liberty conflates different sorts of legal and ethical issues. What the examples of lawbreakers being arrested for consensual activities have in common, Mr. Stossel argues, is society's habit of imposing certain moral views on those who don't share them. Moreover, he discerns hypocrisy and inconsistency in a state's efforts to suppress gambling while promoting its own lottery and to ban marijuana while permitting the use of alcohol and tobacco.

VWhen the lone telephone in this mountain hamlet rang recently, it was the Archbishop of Oaxaca calling with bitter news: San Juan's parish priest, the Rev. Mauro Ortiz Ca rreno, was dead. To the black-shawled women and sandal-wearing farmers who live here, the details of Father Ortiz's death were almost as wrenching as his loss itself. The 42-year-old priest was seized on May 6 in Oaxaca's state capital and killed, mob style, with one shot to the head. The police found his body in the trunk of a car.

VSeveral television specials this year have commemorated the 50th anniversary of Nascar, the stock-car racing organization created in Daytona Beach, Fla., to bring order to what was up to then a chaotic, formless sport. Two of the latest will be shown tonight on TBS, one of a number of channels that now show Nascar's brand of stock-car racing. The first, a segment of ''National Geographic Explorer,'' beginning at 7 P.M., is a superficial look at the sport. That is followed at 9 by ''Nascar at 50: Good to Go,'' which offers a closer examination of some of the struggles in a sport trying to retain its aw-shucks charm while striving to scrape the blood off its knuckles and the grease from its fingernails.

VIn the 1970's San Francisco of ''Armistead Maupin's 'More Tales of the City,' '' the characters may be homosexual, heterosexual or transsexual, but they are all hopeless romantics. In the brash new comedy series ''Sex and the City,'' the heroine cultivates an anti-romantic pose that suits Manhattan in the 90's, with its post-politically correct attitudes. ''I'm a sexual anthropologist,'' says Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), a newspaper columnist who writes: ''Welcome to the age of uninnocence. No one has breakfast at Tiffany's and no one has affairs to remember. Instead we have breakfast at 7 A.M. and affairs we try to forget as soon as possible.'' Though one is gauzy and the other hard-edged, both these shows alight on a particular patch of ground where their characters roam through a hyperrealistic landscape searching for the meaning of love. ''More Tales'' comes up with comforting but pat answers. Things have changed since the original ''Tales of the City'' appeared on PBS in 1994, to deserved acclaim and popularity. The series was distinguished by its matter-of-fact acceptance of all sorts of sexual desire, and it created a warm, enviable, almost innocent world centered around a house at 28 Barbary Lane. We should all have a landlady as wise and reassuring as Anna Madrigal (Olympia Dukakis) to call us ''dear.'' That she grew marijuana in her garden and used to be a man were mere details; the series' openhearted tolerance was one of its most winning qualities. Of course, that attitude evoked right-wing hostility. PBS quickly dropped plans for a sequel (unconvincingly citing the cost).

VFor a look at the month ahead in video, one person to consult is Bob Helland of Asymmetrical Entertainment, a Brooklyn mail-order company that previews coming releases in its monthly bulletin. June looks moderately promising. While not overwhelmingly rich in big feature films -- ''Amistad,'' ''Wag the Dog,'' ''Welcome to Sarajevo'' and ''Wings of the Dove'' are among the better-known titles scheduled -- the list includes several older films that people have been waiting for. From Home Vision come ''Forever and a Day'' (1943), with a big British cast including Charles Laughton, Merle Oberon and Claude Rains, and ''Spitfire'' (1942), Leslie Howard's last film before he was killed when the plane he was aboard was shot down by the Nazis in 1943.

VThe first showers of the rainy season have fallen across parts of Mexico and Central America but have failed to quench many wildfires that are destroying virgin forests and feeding a smoke cloud that is drifting across the southern United States, officials said today. Mexican and American officials predicted that some fires, which have consumed millions of acres of forest and grassland across the region, may continue to rage for several weeks. About 150 fires, 23 of them large, very destructive blazes, were burning this week.

Pino Arlacchi, the executive director of the United Nations International Drug Control Program, proposes the ambitious target of eliminating opium poppies and coca plants, the raw ingredients of heroin and cocaine, in 10 years as well as substantially reducing marijuana.

VGIVEN all the 20th-century icons who have been resurrected and paid homage to in the name of fashion, nothing is more curious than the pedestal erected for that hapless bungler of television fame Gilligan. Or so it would appear from last summer's vogue for the fishing hat, which Bob Denver almost never took off his head in the three years that ''Gilligan's Island'' ruled the airwaves. Then again, Gilligan is the apotheosis of simple chic compared with those other castaways -- the movie star, the millionaire and his wife -- who packed an astounding amount of clothes for a three-hour tour. And Gilligan had the right idea: in tropical weather, a hat protects the head and neck from the sun. Moreover, given the natural impulse to dress down for summer in a lightweight jacket, polo shirt and khakis, a good hat adds a crucial bit of personality and polish to an otherwise lackluster outfit.

VIF the war on drugs is indeed a battle of good versus evil, then Satan is gaining some impressive allies. An open letter to the United Nations Secretary General, on the occasion of the General Assembly's special session on drugs, asserts that ''the global war on drugs is now causing more harm than drug abuse itself.'' Among the signers of the letter were Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former Secretary General; Robert Strauss, the Democratic Party's lobbyist-lawyer; George Shultz, the former secretary of everything to Republican presidents, and even Walter Cronkite. More striking from the parochial perspective of this column, the list includes high-profile economists ranging from Milton Friedman (the Hoover Institution) to Jagdish Bhagwati (Columbia) to Gavin Wright (Stanford).

Running low on one-word answers, he suggested ''not afraid to take chances'' and ''incurably romantic.'' Finally abandoning any pretense at brevity, he hit upon a phase that satisfied him.

V''MY name is Jay, and I'm an alcoholic in recovery,'' said the young man, introducing himself. He listed low points in his life: smoking marijuana at 13, drinking alcohol at 14, dropping out of high school, drinking before work, getting fired from job after job, being arrested for armed robbery and attempting to hang himself in jail. A prison guard cut him down in time, Jay M. got counseling and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. ''Today, I take care of my kids and I do the responsible thing,'' he said. ''I don't have alcohol in my house.'' After applauding Jay's progress, members of the group talked about their own successes and failures at staying sober. It could have been any A.A. meeting except that it was held at East Hartford High School. In 1993, the school established a student assistance center offering alcohol and drug counseling, support groups, weekly A.A. meetings and treatment referrals as well as career planning, peer mediation and conflict resolution. Recently, the school was recognized by the Federal Department of Education for its success in helping troubled students.

In written testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the official, Gen. Barry R.

VWESTERN thought about sex -- from the story of Eve to Aristotle's belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm -- has been tainted by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many more differences than those that are related to reproduction. In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as well.

VBiological and cognitive advantages women have over men discussed in special section Women's Health; science and medicine are finally realizing that differences that exist between sexes necessitate developing distinct therapeutic treatments addressing specifics of our physiology; for example, some doctors are advocating use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric disorders, like depression; Dr Susan G Kornstein says that while depressed men seem to respond better to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems, women repond better to drugs that affect only serotonin system; says these differences not only underscore need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered doses of whatever is being prescribed for men, but support idea that men's and women's brains do not function in same way, largely because of hormonal differences (M)

VThe truck driver involved in the fatal wreck of a commuter train last Thursday tested positive for marijuana immediately afterward, the authorities said today. The 39-year-old trucker, Keith J. Lintz, was driving a double-trailer rig into a steel mill in Portage, Ind., 30 miles southeast of Chicago, when the truck, carrying three 40,000-pound steel coils, became trapped between two parallel sets of train tracks. Having stopped for a freight train that was passing in front of him on one set of tracks, Mr. Lintz watched with apparent helplessness as the Chicago-bound commuter train, on the other tracks, crashed into his rear trailer. The impact hurled one of the coils into the front car of the two-car train, killing three passengers and injuring six.

VHousing officials in Oakland, Calif, are trying to evict Herman Walker, 75, from his public housing apartment, claiming they found cocaine or cocaine paraphernalia in his apartment or in possession of people who spent time there; Walker says he is not aware of drugs; lawsuit Walker filed in response to eviction action illustrates growing conflict between Federal officials, who urge local housing agencies to crack down on illegal drug use, and some advocates for the poor, who say innocent people are falling victim to Draconian offensive in war on drugs; in Walker's case, people accused of having drugs or drug paraphernalia were private caretaker and another visitor to his apartment; Judge Charles R Breyer, in preliminary injunction, cited American With Disabilities Act in saying Walker's right to home health care would be compromised by obligation to supervise caretaker's activities; photo (M)

VIn august 1996, jerry mcginnes, a sulking, brooding 18-year-old, awaited sentencing in a Fort Collins, Colo., courtroom. His tattoos -- the sun and a cross on his forearms and unintelligible markings on his knuckles, a result of a drunken evening -- lent Jerry an air of defiance. The Juvenile Court magistrate, Joseph Coyte, asked if he had anything to say. Jerry, who had dropped out of school, had been on probation for stealing a car when he cut off his ankle monitor and fled for San Diego to live with his sister. There, he smoked marijuana and hung out until deciding he'd had enough of being on the run. He then turned himself in. The prosecutor asked that the judge send him to a youth prison. Jerry rose; his hands, manacled and shaking, clutched a penciled four-page letter he had written. He read it aloud. Magistrate Coyte,

VAlready Dead: A California Gothic By Denis Johnson. Harper Perennial, $13. In this creepy novel populated by a large cast of petty crooks and wack jobs, an alcoholic marijuana grower facing the twin threats of disinheritance and retaliation for a cocaine deal gone bad cooks up a wild scheme with a Nietzsche-quoting drifter. ''Once Johnson gets his hooks into you -- it takes about two sentences -- it's . . . pretty much impossible to stop reading,'' David Gates wrote here last year. American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence By Pauline Maier. Vintage, $14. This feisty and highly original study, selected as one of the best books of 1997 by the editors of the Book Review, presents the Declaration of Independence as the embodiment of the American mind and colonial experience rather than as a product of Thomas Jefferson's pen or the expression of some philosophy of natural rights. By placing the document in the context of 90 previous declarations issued throughout the Colonies, the author ''offers Americans a fresh perspective on their most treasured national relic,'' Richard Alan Ryerson wrote here last year. Angel in the Whirlwind: The Triumph of the American Revolution, by Benson Bobrick (Penguin, $15.95), reminds readers that the Revolutionary War was full of amazing stories and characters -- led by a heaven-sent hero (George Washington) and a world-class villain (Benedict Arnold). Bobrick ''has studied his subject deeply and writes about it with real understanding and verve,'' Frederick Allen said in these pages in 1997. In The Long Affair: Thomas Jefferson and the French Revolution, 1785-1800, by Conor Cruise O'Brien (University of Chicago, $15), an Irish author locates a strain of visionary violence in Jefferson's near-religious defense of the Revolution. In 1996 Richard Brookhiser said this ''cranky and sweeping'' narrative ''goes a long way to show that the bust has shoulders of clay.'' Whittaker Chambers: A Biography By Sam Tanenhaus. Modern Library, $16. The accuser of Alger Hiss gets sympathetic, but not hagiographic, treatment in this copious biography, which sheds new light on its famously enigmatic protagonist, especially his post-Hiss existence. Last year in the Book Review, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called this a ''serious and absorbing work.'' Medicine Men By Alice Adams. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14. The author demolishes the divine right of American doctorhood by having her 40-ish heroine wonder whether her crushing headaches are an allergic reaction to her physicians -- all of them men. Last year our reviewer, Deborah Mason, lamented the unrelenting doctor-bashing but said the novel ''in many ways . . . is representative of the bracing frankness and tart ironies of the Adams oeuvre.'' The same publisher has reissued Superior Women ($14), a melancholy group portrait that follows five mismatched Radcliffe girls -- rich, poor, fat, thin -- through four decades of growing disappointment and crises of midlife and identity. In 1984 in these pages, Lois Gould admired Adams's ''elegant, rhythmic style'' and ''fine, wry logic.'' The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty By Carolyn G. Heilbrun. Ballantine, $12. Turning 70, a feminist pioneer and scholar looks back on the unexpected pleasures, friendships and rewards of her 60's. This buoyant collection of revelations and reflections is ''like a letter to a friend, the kind you don't lie to,'' Rebecca Pepper Sinkler wrote here in 1997. Traces: Stories By Ida Fink. Translated by Philip Boehm and Francine Prose. Owl/Holt, $12. These spare, lucid tales about everyday life among the Jewish bourgeoisie in Nazi-era Poland mix normalcy with terror, revealing the avid need of accountants, housewives and piano students to live fully even in the shadow of death. ''Fink's gift is for the delicate miniature, the oblique detail that freezes the reader's heart,'' Fernanda Eberstadt said here last year. Our Guys: The Glen Ridge Rape and the Secret Life of the Perfect Suburb By Bernard Lefkowitz. Vintage, $15. This disturbing account of the highly publicized rape of a mentally retarded girl by a group of teen-age athletes suggests that similar crimes are being committed across the nation and that much of the fault lies in America's cult of the sports hero. Last year in the Book Review, Russell Banks called this ''a calm, methodical, painstakingly researched book . . . that should be read by parents and educators alike.'' Kowloon Tong By Paul Theroux. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12. A British mother and her 43-year-old son living in Hong Kong confront the imminent ''Chinese take-away'' with passive rage and resentment in this novel. ''Theroux's astringent misanthropy and narrative momentum are powerful propellants,'' Thomas Keneally wrote here in 1997. Many of the 60-odd tales in Theroux's Collected Stories (Penguin, $15.95) are inhabited by ordinary no-nonsense people who find themselves immersed in Gothic goings-on, or solitary narrators whose anonymity is threatened by outside forces. ''Theroux displays . . . a remarkable ear,'' William H. Pritchard wrote here last year. ''He . . . inhabits his sentences in a rewardingly comic way.'' Scott Veale

VTHESE summer weekends reveal my most embarrassing weakness. As my neighbors head down to the beach, loaded with coolers, towels and bottles of expensive grease, I lurk at home. I feel as guilty as an atheist at morning service time. But the sad truth is, I just don't believe in the beach. This is unfortunate, because Long Island is really just a large beach with strip malls. We're never very far from the sea, just as we're never very far from a pizza slice. But most of the time, the ocean exists only as a geographical concept. We know it's there, but we can't see it because almost every inch of the shoreline is built up, fenced off and marked with signs saying ''Private.''

VDown a dusty, rocky trail and through a knot of pine trees, past a naked guy chewing leaves, a fully clothed Christian choir and a retired Jewish pie thrower, is the meadow where the Rainbow Family is holding its 27th annual gathering to party and pray for peace. Thousands of members of this family of old hippies and young converts, of blacks and whites, of American Indians and recent immigrants, of babies and grandparents, have come from across the country to the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, just west of this two-stoplight town near the New Mexico border, for an annual gathering that lasts for about three weeks. They gather to tune in love and to tune out what some Rainbow members call Babylon, the outside world of stock markets, guns, wars and drug tests.

VHillel Bodek hurtled through the interstices of 100 Centre Street, the voluminous State Supreme Court building in Manhattan where criminal cases are heard, muttering to himself his signature refrains, ''It is what it is'' and ''What can I tell you.'' Even at his fleet pace, he never gets far before someone flags him down. Kevin Hynes, a lawyer with a client facing drug charges, buttonholed him. ''Hillel, I want my client to wear a sweater in court instead of a leather jacket,'' he said. ''How do I do that?''

VThe Netherlands had its jaw tightly set today for the arrival of Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the outspoken commander of the American war on drugs. Several days ago the general prepared for his visit by dealing a few public punches against the Dutch and their tolerance for narcotics. General McCaffrey is on an eight-day tour of European cities, looking at how Europeans fight and cope with drugs. That includes the Netherlands, which more than any other country has painstakingly developed a division between ''soft'' and ''hard'' drugs. It is where over the counter one can buy small bags of ''space cake,'' ''northern light'' or ''zeropolm'' -- all forms of marijuana -- and not go to jail.

VIt was about 9 on a recent Wednesday night, and the crowds had already started gathering around the West Village piers. More than three dozen young men lingered at the waterfront just off the West Side Highway, talking and smoking cigarettes and marijuana. Dozens more milled in front of a pornographic video store across the highway at Christopher Street. Men in expensive cars cruised by. Frequently they stopped, exchanging brief, hushed words with youths who approached, climbed into the cars and rode away.

VCommunity board in West Village section of Manhattan proposes opening an emergency shelter for the young men, most of them gay and many of them homeless runaways, who have been gathering around the piers there over the last two years; 20 beds in the proposed shelter would not come close to housing the 500 or so homeless youths, but backers say shelter would offer them important services, including AIDS education, life skills training and mental health and substance abuse counseling; proposal is far from complete, and an array of questions has yet to be resolved, but there is no organized opposition to the idea so far; photo (M)

VState officials yesterday released a 273-page manual of guidelines intended to help school districts guard against drug abuse by students within legal limits. According to the manual, released jointly by Attorney General Peter Verniero and the state Education Commissioner, Leo F. Klagholz, random drug testing of student athletes is permissible, but the results cannot be turned over to prosecutors; smelling marijuana or alcohol on a student's breath constitutes just cause for a search, and drug-sniffing dogs can be unleashed on lockers, but not on students themselves.

VSTEPHEN SONDHEIM A Life By Meryle Secrest 461 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $30. After the heyday of the American musical theater, which began with Irving Berlin, the Gershwins and Cole Porter and lasted for half a century, Stephen Sondheim is the only composer and lyricist with an original vision and a flourishing body of work. With ''Company,'' ''A Little Night Music,'' ''Sweeney Todd'' and other shows, he has set the standard for all who have followed him. The sound of Sondheim is pervasive -- from him and from those he has influenced.

''He had something against'' President Clinton personally and the government, said Jerry Swihart, an employee of the Warm Springs State Mental Hospital in Montana. ''He was possessed by it.

VTWO years ago, on Mother's Day, a Trumbull police officer, George Coleman, stopped a black male motorist in a van and told him he needed to check his license and registration. Unaware that the motorist was State Senator Alvin W. Penn, a Democrat of Bridgeport, the officer returned the license and registration and, said Mr. Penn, asked if he knew which town he was in. ''I asked why I was being stopped and why I needed to be aware of which town I was in; I wanted to know what difference that made,'' said Mr. Penn, recalling how he got lost that day trying to find a short cut to the Trumbull Shopping Park and was turning around on a dead-end street when the officer blocked his van with a patrol car.

VHe had won the 1996 Copper Bowl with the University of Wisconsin, then quickly spent New Year's Eve partying with friends in Las Vegas. Soon it was mid-January and John Hall figured it was time to take a break from college and head home to Port Charlotte, Fla. Besides, he had received no invitation to attend the National Football League scouting combine that February. So Hall trucked his way home and stayed for nearly three weeks, and there the 6-foot-3-inch, 225-pound place-kicker ballooned to 238 pounds. He developed plenty of gut, he said, for his seven siblings and for his parents, Barbara and Fred, to love. He found himself at home savoring a few things he loves -- eating alligator tail, fishing, gigging frogs and hunting wild hogs and turkeys. Oh, and surfing, too. Typical stuff for your typical 24-year-old kicker?

VMAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI'S pronouncement last week that New York City should abolish methadone treatment for heroin addicts by the year 2000 drew fire from many drug-abuse experts. They insist that methadone is the best tool they have to help addicts reduce heroin use, stay out of jail and get back to work. In fact, some said, they wished they had something like it to treat cocaine addiction. That's some endorsement for a treatment that simply replaces one addictive substance with another. Methadone, a morphine-related drug taken orally to mute an addict's cravings as well as heroin's effect, doesn't even help everyone who tries the treatment. And while it helps others to kick heroin, it often doesn't wean them off drugs completely.

VTHE medical use of marijuana is controversial for a simple, obvious reason: In addition to the benefits, like relief for cancer-related nausea, patients get high. But one marijuana ingredient may have significant therapeutic value without the psychoactive effect, according to a study by Government neuroscientists, among them a Nobel laureate. In test tube experiments, the ingredient, cannibidiol, prevented more than half of the brain cell death associated with stroke, according to results published in the July issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Cannibidiol proved to be a powerful antioxidant, neutralizing some of the ravages caused by strokes. The effect was far greater than that of other antioxidants, including vitamins A and C.

VThe third annual Smokin' Grooves tour, which came to the PNC Bank Arts Center here tonight, might as well have been called the Hip-Hop Holdouts tour. It assembled groups that insist, against the commercial tide, that hip-hop isn't exclusively about ''playas'' who brag about their wealth, their women, their brand-name possessions and their unsavory pasts while borrowing the melodies of pop hits. For three of the groups on the bill -- Public Enemy, Gang Starr and Wyclef Jean's Refugee Camp -- hip-hop is still a way to address social issues, using the beat to carry messages. ''It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'/But damn the game if it don't mean nothing,'' Chuck D. intones in ''He Got Game,'' the title track from Public Enemy's current album. The other headliners, Cypress Hill and Busta Rhymes with the Flipmode Squad, also stand outside the ''playa'' realm. Cypress Hill sticks to its narrow obsessions with marijuana and guns, and Busta Rhymes single-mindedly incites a party.

VRussell E. Weston Jr., the suspect in the fatal shootings of two police officers in the nation's Capitol, may have chosen an unusually public place to explode. But his history of mental illness has much in common with other delusional mentally ill people who become violent, illustrating both the cracks in the nation's mental-health system and its difficulty in compelling treatment, even for those at risk of becoming violent. Mr. Weston's illness was well-known to family and mental health officials. But because of the closing of state mental hospitals across the country and the failure to build a promised network of local clinics as a replacement, the treatment of choice for him, as for the vast majority of mental patients, was the honor system: counting on him to give himself the often unpleasant antipsychotic drugs prescribed for his paranoid schizophrenia.

VMental health history of Russell E Weston Jr, man charged with murders of two police officers in US Capitol, illustrates both cracks in nation's mental-health system and difficulty in compelling treatment even for the potentially violent; Weston was not taking medication, may have been using other drugs and had paranoid delusions that Government was out to get him; his problem was compounded by living in rural areas where psychiatric treatment and monitoring are extremely limited; closing of mental state hospitals nationwide and failure to build promised network of local clinics as replacement have left an honor system as treatment of choice for people like Weston, who was expected to give himself often unpleasant antipsychotic drugs for paranoid schizophrenia; photo (M)

VIT would be easier for Chris Schwartz, rap music producer and high school dropout, to reveal the secrets of his success if his cellular phone would stop ringing. Or if he would stop answering it. Not that he's not apologetic. ''I really am sorry, '' Mr. Schwartz says. Then, to a distressed artist on the other end of the line who one suspects is the singer Lauryn Hill, about to come out with her first solo album: ''No, he didn't say you were going to look like an icon; he's afraid that's what people are going to think.''

VThe Hamptons didn't exactly offer President Clinton a red carpet and a clamorous ovation this weekend. The greeting was more confused than that, more complicated, muted. Yes, there were the high-profile parties, being thrown by the likes of the investment banker Bruce Wasserstein and the actors Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, where the President is expected to raise some $2 million for the Democratic National Committee. And there was the hospitality of Steven Spielberg, who offered the President and First Lady his Georgica Pond estate, arguably as desirable a place to spend the night as the Lincoln bedroom.

VOnce a summer since 1972, a loose-knit group of hippies called the Rainbow Family has converged on various plots of publicly owned land to pray for world peace. . .and party wildly. The Rainbow gathering started small, but it has grown into a sprawling, messy, weeks-long bash for hordes of anti-establishment revelers. This year, some 25,000 Rainbows descended on Springerville, Ariz. (population 1,900), setting up in a sensitive meadow in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. Springerville is a conservative town, and residents and U.S. Forest Service staff braced for the worst, based on rumors and reports from previous Rainbow gatherings about environmental destruction, wildfires, burglary, rampant public nudity and drugs. How bad was it? Here's a look. THE PARTY: Hundreds of acres of woods and rolling meadow have been transformed into a mud-trampled commons. Several thousand people, many of them nude, mill about, sit in mud puddles, beat on drums, dance. A man who calls himself Amazing Dave is whispering into a walkie-talkie. ''We've got a brother who took some bad medicine,'' he says. ''Let's go check it out.'' Dave is a member of the Rainbow Family's self-appointed peace-keeping force, the Shanti Sena. Exciting emergency: An irate man runs up, claiming, ''There's a child molester named Woody on the loose.''

VElected officials and their professional handlers are forever condemning reporters and historians for focusing on politicians' character and personality. But over time, the study of the shaping influence of personal history has proved a reliable way to judge fitness for office and make reasonable predictions about performance under pressure. Thus the real suspense in Washington these days is not over what, if any, indiscretions President Clinton might confess, but in whether he can gather himself to meet his crisis. This mode of analysis will not appeal, of course, to those who see Mr. Clinton as a victim. Our view is that history will depict him as the architect of his situation in a way that illustrates how a President's inner reality shapes his destiny.

VNegotiators for the National Basketball Association and its players met constructively, they thought, for nearly two hours yesterday morning. Then they broke for lunch, and each side had to wonder what was in the water the other side had with its food. Within 15 minutes after the negotiators returned from lunch, the owners' group abruptly ended the session, dismissing a union proposal as economically perilous. Both sides accused the other of deliberately torpedoing the meeting and the immediate chance for progress in the off-season lockout.

VThe Manhattan District Attorney's office is investigating allegations that the construction industry consultants who guide architects, engineers and contractors through the complicated web of city permits have bribed city officials and construction contractors, investigators said. The investigation, part of a vast, years-old inquiry into corruption in the construction and real estate industries, is focusing on reports that the consultants, known as expediters, have paid off officials of the Buildings Department to speed up the permitting process and bribed contracting companies to win jobs, the investigators said.

VA child welfare supervisor was arrested yesterday when he tried to walk into the Brooklyn Family Court building with 31 small plastic bags of marijuana, city officials said. The supervisor, Israel Rodriguez, 39, was supposed to examine computers in the courthouse, at 283 Adams Street in downtown Brooklyn. But court officers, who followed routine by searching Mr. Ramirez as he walked into the building shortly after 4 P.M., arrested him when they discovered the bags of marijuana and five marijuana cigarettes, officials said.

Mr. Washington's car, a blue and beige Ford Bronco with gleaming mag wheels and tinted windows, was washed and waxed in the morning. And before he meets up with fellow members of the Hustler Nation car club in the afternoon to caravan to the cruise, he polishes the tires and knocks the dust off.

VTo the Sports Editor: In life, one must sometimes distinguish between a man's reputation, earned in the past, and his present reality. There are many reasons that Georgetown Coach John Thompson should not be admitted to the Basketball Hall of Fame. Thompson has not reached the Final Four in 13 years (and the final eight only once in that time). Compare this record to, say, Jim Boeheim, who has continued to coach successful teams at Syracuse even in years of lean talent.

VWith an absent father and a single mother who could not control her five sons, Shatiek Johnson fell into a world of drugs and gangs and angry shootouts long before he was old enough to vote. His father is a convicted drug dealer. So is his oldest brother. Another brother was involved in a wild gunfight. Violence was never too far away in the Staten Island public housing projects where the family lived. Two gangs, the Bloods and the Wolfpack, competed to control the local market for marijuana and crack cocaine.

VShatiek Johnson is charged with second degree murder in shooting death of Police Officer Gerard Carter in Staten Island housing project on July 26; Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani and Gov George E Pataki say that 17-year-old ex-convict symbolizes failings of state's prison early release program; dysfunctional picture of Johnson that emerges from interviews with police investigators, prosecutors, neighbors and friends is of teen-ager described as once being 'nice kid,' but who by age of 15, had been convicted of manslaughter for beating death of homeless man; Johnson, in addition to Carter's fatal shooting, will be indicted in killing of rival gang leader; police and local residents, in eerie example of interconnectedness of people in neighborhood, say that Johnson and Carter were once briefly related by marriage; photo (M)

VIn my 1960's youth, America couldn't stop talking about -- or taking -- a drug that promised sexual ecstasy and a sensory trip. If memory serves, it was called marijuana and, though widely available, was illegal. Three decades later, the new national drug of choice also promises sexual ecstasy and, as a potential side effect, what the Food and Drug Administration describes as mild temporary perceptual ''changes in blue/ green colors.'' It is called Viagra, and not only is it a legal prescription medication, but anyone with a credit card can score some over the Internet without even seeing or speaking to a doctor. I know because I did. Viagra is the emblem of our fin-de-millennium drug culture. On the market only since April, it has spawned a cottage industry in humor, not unlike all the stoned comedy of the 60's, and is minting money for Pfizer, its manufacturer. Pfizer ''has refined the art of publicizing a 'blockbuster drug' . . . not unlike the way Hollywood releases a summertime action flick,'' writes the journalist Greg Critser in his Salon magazine report on the sprawling Viagra industry. ''It's kind of off the charts,'' said a Pfizer spokeswoman last week, sounding very Hollywood as she talked about Viagra's box-office.

The Department of Justice had won a temporary restraining order in May against the Oakland cooperative and five other medical marijuana providers in Northern California, claiming that they were in violation of Federal laws. Three of cooperatives shut down, while the others, including the one in Oakland, have defied the Federal court ruling.

VLucian K. Truscott 4th has never been shy about pointing -- or, more precisely, wagging -- his finger at his hallowed alma mater, which looms tall and imposing above the Hudson River here. In a quarter century of novels, newspaper articles and television appearances, and most famously in his best-selling 1978 mystery ''Dress Gray,'' Mr. Truscott has chided the United States Military Academy and the Army for secrecy and chastised them for sexism and homophobia, describing flawed societies too often governed by prejudice and personal ambition.

VThe rolling fields of Max Yasgur's old farm are once again swathed in a psychedelic quilt of tie-dye-clad music fans. This time, though, the fans are carrying cellular telephones, and the automatic teller machines are just a few steps away. ''I think high-tech is kind of infringing on the hippies,'' said Kevin Carter, who was working at a one-hour photo development stand, one of the many commercial vendors at a three-day concert called ''A Day in the Garden,'' on the site of the original Woodstock festival. ''Some of the die-hard Woodies are having problems with it.''

VChris Webber of the Sacramento Kings was fined $500 for carrying a small amount of marijuana that was detected by dogs at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rican customs officials said yesterday. Webber had 11 grams of marijuana in his luggage when he was detained during his layover in San Juan. He then resumed his trip from the Dominican Republic to Barbados. Webber was traveling with Jerry Stackhouse of the Detroit Pistons and other athletes on a trip sponsored by the sporting goods company Fila.

Presidential candidate Bill Clinton went on the ''60 Minutes'' program right after the Super Bowl in late January 1992 to clear up the Gennifer Flowers mess. The idea was to tell the truth, to be straight with the American people, and thus save his damaged candidacy. Here's what happened. With more than 30 million viewers looking on, and with Hillary Clinton at his side, he lied.

VOn Jan. 20, 1997, as an ebullient Bill Clinton took the oath of office for the second term that he hoped would secure his place in history, he returned to a theme that had been at the core of his claim to be a new kind of Democrat, declaring: ''Each and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families but for our neighbors and our nation.'' One year later, Mr. Clinton learned that Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, was investigating accusations that the President had started a sexual relationship with a White House intern in 1995 and then tried to cover it up.

VIt was called Proposition 200 and it seemed straight-forward enough when it appeared on Arizona ballots in the fall of 1996. Backed by a well-financed grass-roots organization that called itself Arizonans for Drug Policy Reform, it proposed allowing doctors to prescribe marijuana and other illegal drugs for medical use by grievously ill and dying patients. Voters approved it.

VDespite its merry tunes and brightly colored exterior, the ice cream truck that plied the streets of Bensonhurst was not your typical dispenser of summertime treats for the boys and girls of Brooklyn. For one thing, the truck was known to bear down on frightened children riding their bikes, according to a neighborhood resident. For another, there were often three or four teen-agers inside, more than was needed to dole out ice cream cones and Popsicles.

VAmerican law-enforcement officials regard Charles Miller as one of the most dangerous and powerful drug traffickers in the Caribbean and have been seeking his extradition for two years. Now the stakes are higher than ever: the State Department says he has threatened to kill American college students enrolled here if the local Government hands him over to the United States. Having furnished Mr. Miller with his freedom and the identity he now uses, the American authorities have every reason to take that warning seriously. Less than a decade ago, when he was a police informer called Cecil Connor, Mr. Miller was granted full immunity to testify in a case against Jamaican drug gangs operating in Florida and New York. He acknowledged involvement in nine drug-related slayings and was placed in the Federal witness-protection program.

VBecky Gatling will never forget her introduction to the real National Basketball Association. It was November 1991 and she and her husband, Ray, were waiting outside a locker room for their son Chris, then a rookie with the Golden State Warriors. The game had been over for nearly an hour and while most of the fans had filed out of the arena, Becky Gatling was amazed by how many were still hanging around, waiting for the Warriors. ''I was saying, 'Oh, this is great, look at all these family members,' '' she recalled. ''Then a player came up to me and said: 'Mrs. Gatling, these are not family members. These are hoochie mamas.'

VPolice officials yesterday staunchly defended the shooting of a Brooklyn teen-ager by two officers who mistook his water gun for the real thing, but the youth's distraught family demanded answers about why the officers fired at him 17 times. The injured youth, Michael Jones, who was hit in the legs with six of the shots, took a turn for the worse last night and was taken into emergency surgery moments after his family -- and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who took up his cause -- visited him at his bedside at Kings County Hospital Center, where they found him unconscious and breathing through a tube. Michael was listed in critical condition last night after the surgery.

VThe Real Blonde Mangling some Arthur Miller dialogue, Joe (Matthew Modine) lands an assignment in a Madonna video. Meanwhile, his girlfriend (Catherine Keener) takes self-defense classes and helps primp a supermodel named Sahara (Bridgette Wilson) for spreads shot by Blair (Marlo Thomas), a voraciously intense fashion photographer who knows all about taking pictures but nothing about what they represent. Finally, there's Joe's friend Bob (Maxwell Caulfield, above with Daryl Hannah), a smirky, sex-obsessed type on the prowl for a genuine blonde. Using a sharp satirical eye, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, Tom DiCillio ''directed this shrewd comedy with a sharp notion of exactly what he wants to skewer.''

VWith Hurricane Bonnie bearing down on the Eastern Seaboard and rough surf advisories in effect, it was just the type of emergency call that rescue workers had been bracing for. Kimberly Kuda flagged down a police officer in Point Pleasant Beach just after 7:30 P.M. Monday to say her future husband had been swept into the Atlantic. As a Coast Guard helicopter and rescue boats frantically searched the dark, gnashing ocean, Ms. Kuda, 21, appeared so distraught, Detective Sgt. Harry DiCorcia of the Point Pleasant Beach police said, that an emergency psychiatric team was brought in to help. But now, after two unexpected twists, investigators say her fiance, Antonio Mandarino Jr., is still alive and that his drowning and her distress were a hoax.

VTHE exhibition of sculpture by Bisa Washington at the Morris Museum contains 23 separate works. But with the help of a little explanation from Ms. Washington, they conspire to make up an epic that is both cosmic and local. An artist's statement posted on the wall says, ''African and Oceanic art are the sources of constant inspiration.'' A viewer readily detects both influences: the pieces have the grandeur and authority associated with African sculpture, but they also have the sharp confrontational aspects of art from New Guinea. With one notable exception, each piece is black, but the exhibition is never solemn.

VMARK SYLVERS had just lost a game of chess in Bryant Park recently and was being consoled by his opponent. ''You're pretty good,'' said Laura Ross, who will turn 10 this week. ''It was really close.'' But moments earlier, her face, under butterfly barrettes, had the look of a killer as she grabbed pieces from the 43-year old. A crowd had gathered around them during the game. ''She's so tiny,'' a woman said. ''Who would think a little girl like that could play chess?''

He was like a 10-year-old, she said, subsisting on gallons of milk and boxes of Cocoa Puffs and Freihofer's chocolate-chip cookies. Robbin Evans, his sister, remembers how he skateboarded with her son and bounced on a trampoline as joyously as a child.

VRod Woodson of the Baltimore Ravens, a member of the National Football League's 75th anniversary team, violated the league's substance-abuse policy last month, refusing to take a second random drug test, according to executives from several teams. Woodson, one of the best cornerbacks to play the game, relented and took the test a day later and passed it. However, according to the league's drug policy, a refusal to take a drug test counts as a failure. Therefore, Woodson entered Stage 1 of the league's substance-abuse program. It calls for an evaluation by a psychiatrist, as well as an increase in random drug testing. If Woodson, who has never failed a drug test, refuses to take another random test, he could be suspended for four games.

VDon't let rudolph giuliani fool you: methadone works. Since its introduction in the mid-1960's, studies have consistently shown that the synthetic narcotic cuts addicts' craving for heroin, enabling onetime street junkies to restart their lives. In so doing, methadone helps boost employment, inhibit the spread of H.I.V. and cut crime. That's why the New York City Mayor's recent attacks -- he denounced methadone as a chemical that's used to enslave people and promised to abolish it from the city over the next few years -- have left experts scratching their heads. The Mayor appears driven by a moral conviction that complete abstinence from drugs is the only acceptable course. Yet if Giuliani were truly interested in promoting abstinence from drugs, he would have not simply condemned methadone but also announced a major expansion of treatment programs whose express goal is to wean addicts from the substance. (The city has virtually no such programs now.) He would also have announced the creation of more residential programs that seek to change addicts' behavior. The Mayor's failure to do any of this raises the suspicion that it is not just methadone he dislikes -- but drug treatment in general.

VWith the arrests of two cruise ship employees yesterday as their vessel docked in Manhattan, Federal law enforcement officials revealed the existence of an unusual drug ring that they said used luxury ocean liners to funnel cocaine, hashish and marijuana from New York City to the island of Bermuda. These officials estimated that the operation, which involved slightly more than a dozen people with code names like Fidel, 007, Ratty and Puny, accounted for 25 percent to 50 percent of the illegal drugs flowing into Bermuda in recent years.

VAS state governments experiment with drug law reform, Connecticut is emerging as an innovator. The state was one of the first to allow needle-exchange programs, which offer intravenous drug users clean syringes in exchange for used ones. Such programs were started in Connecticut in 1988, after they were shown to be effective in slowing the spread of AIDS, said David D. Biklen, executive director of the Connecticut Law Revision Commission, which researches drug and substance-abuse issues and drug policy options, and makes recommendations to the General Assembly's public health committee. Connecticut is beginning allowing convicted drug offenders or criminals whose crimes are the result of alcohol or drug abuse to avoid prison time on the condition they undergo frequent testing for drug or alcohol abuse. (The state is said to be the first to do so.)

VOnly several days ago, the acrimony between Minnesota Vikings Coach Dennis Green and the team's new owner, Red McCombs, seemed thicker than cement. McCombs had rejected two contract proposals from Green's agent, Ray Anderson, with the latest rejection coming just last week. It increasingly looked as if Green was going to leave the Vikings at the end of the season. Then Anderson received a shocking call from representatives of McCombs on Wednesday -- they wanted to make a deal. For the next 48 hours the two sides hammered out an agreement and now Green has what he wanted and what many around the National Football League say he deserved: a long-term contract and security.

VWHEN the State Supreme Court issued a ruling this summer that students may be expelled for behavior off school grounds only if such behavior ''markedly interrupts or severely impedes the day-to-day operation of a school,'' educators said they feared it would be much tougher to keep even the most potentially violent students out of school. School officials insist that aggressive use of the state policy sanctioned by the Attorney General's office in the late 1980's and passed into law by the General Assembly two years ago -- and recently updated -- has allowed schools to keep gang leaders, drug dealers and violent teen-agers out of their classrooms and hallways.

VGunmen dressed in black and carrying assault rifles pulled three families from their homes early this morning and shot at least 20 men, women and children against a wall in what the police described as a drug-related slaying. The killings, which occurred in a suburb of this city, 60 miles south of the California border, surpassed any previous drug-related violence in the border cities that are the focus of Mexico's billion-dollar narcotics industry. They approached in ferocity the massacres in southern Mexico that have accompanied a bitter Indian insurgency.

VIt sounds like a typical child welfare dispute: The foster parents who have reared a 2 1/2-year-old boy almost since birth want to adopt him. The boy's mother, who lost him because of addiction but has since stopped using drugs, wants him back. But when the foster parents are a powerful city alderman and a prominent judge, accusations of political favoritism are bound to bubble up. And because the couple are white and the child is black, the case has also brought a small petition drive and a protest vigil led by a black minister outside the alderman's office.

VThe father of a 9-year-old Brooklyn girl was arrested yesterday on suspicion that he drowned his young daughter late Thursday night because she was taking too long washing herself in the bathtub, the police said. Anthony Smith, a paroled robber who was once arrested but not convicted in the scalding of one of his sons, called the police to his Crown Heights home at 11:10 P.M., telling the operator that his daughter had stopped breathing, the police said. When officers and emergency medical technicians entered the apartment at 1226 Lincoln Place, the police said, they found Antoinette Smith's nude body resting in a tub of water, where the young girl appeared to have drowned.

VUnited States border inspectors searched slightly more than a million commercial trucks and railway cars entering the United States from Mexico last year. They found cocaine stashed in cargo compartments on only six occasions, said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House director of drug control policy. He cites the dispiriting statistic in pressing for an overhaul of the strategy for stanching the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. Slightly more than half of the cocaine smuggled into the United States, and much of the heroin, marijuana and methamphetamines, comes through Mexico.

VUnited States border inspectors searched slightly more than a million commercial trucks and railway cars entering the United States from Mexico last year. They found cocaine stashed in cargo compartments on only six occasions, said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House director of drug control policy. He cites the dispiriting statistic in pressing for an overhaul of the strategy for stanching the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. Slightly more than half of the cocaine smuggled into the United States, and much of the heroin, marijuana and methamphetamines, comes through Mexico.

One wears jeans beneath leather pants strategically cut out to show off both his denimed bottom and his front. Turns out they are not what they seem but drag kings, or female performers who cross-dress as men: Sharon Niesp, who's appeared in several of John Waters's films, and Maureen Fischer, better known as Mo B. (for Bodacious) Dick. Well, you don't expect Miss Manners on a John Waters set.

VWe seem minutes away from an all-''Dateline'' channel, and show-business gossip is a growth industry; no wonder two of the season's most likable sitcoms are set behind the scenes of fictional quasi-news programs and take a shrewd look at television itself. The sharply written ''Sports Night'' (beginning tomorrow) and the goofy ''Brian Benben Show'' (which has its premiere tonight) have radically different styles, but share a media-savvy attitude. The freshness of their comic approaches can be measured by how far they have come from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' still the godmother of all sitcoms that find humor in an associate producer's job. A comedy laced with sincerity, ''Sports Night'' is about a cable show by that name, resembling ESPN's ''Sports Center,'' but it works perfectly well for viewers who can't tell a Met from a Yankee (trust me). The hosts of the fictional ''Sports Night'' are Dan (Josh Charles) and Casey (Peter Krause), who in the first episode is newly divorced and worn down by too many stories about millionaire athletes getting into bar brawls. ''I've turned into a P.R. man for punks and thugs,'' Casey says, as the show deftly brings sports into more general terrain. These actors are smooth, but so far their characters are less vivid than those of the staff around them and less bracing than the traces of cynicism in the air. Isaac (Robert Guillaume), their executive producer, says he's close to firing everyone because Casey's slump is hurting the show. ''But you won't because we're all family here and I'm just like a daughter to you,'' says Dana (Felicity Huffman), the show's brisk producer, with an acknowledgment that they have inherited the Mary Richards and Lou Grant roles. ''No, this is a television show here and you're very much like an employee to me,'' Isaac says. That is partly true, but it is also the kind of smoke screen Lou would have created. The entire staff protects Casey (and next week Dan) from the network suits, today's equivalent of bad guys in black hats. The series is acted with razorlike timing. In the first episode's funniest, snappiest scene, Dana interviews Jeremy (Joshua Malina), an endearingly insecure sports geek, for a job as a researcher. And the attention to crisp dialogue sets this show apart from most others. ''Sports Night'' was created by, and the first two episodes written by, Aaron Sorkin, with a swift rhythm to its language, and even a staccato echo of his play and screenplay for ''A Few God Men.'' Yet at times Mr. Sorkin spells out clumsily what real people would never say. ''I love producing 'Sports Night,' '' Dana tells Casey. ''I live from 11 to midnight and the rush is so huge I don't come down till 3 o'clock in the morning.'' In the second episode, Dan is asked to apologize on the air for saying in a magazine interview that marijuana should be legal. That leads to a speech and a slightly mawkish ending. What saves this immensely appealing series from its own preachy impulses is that we can always feel its awkwardly phrased ''rush'' of energy. The more lightweight ''Brian Benben Show'' is built on a common but true assumption: the Ted Baxters of the world have taken over local news, that broadest and most irresistible of television targets. Mr. Benben, best known as the fantasizing Martin Tupper of the HBO series ''Dream On,'' inspires sympathy here as a character named Brian Benben. He has been pushed aside as an anchor at a Los Angeles station in favor of two young, plastic airheads. ''Ken and Barbie have entered the building,'' Benben's colleagues say when they spot the new anchors. Benben is handed a fluffy human-interest segment called ''L.A. Story.'' In a mini-homage to the famous ''Mary Tyler Moore'' episode in which Chuckles the Clown, dressed as a peanut, is crushed to death by an elephant, we see Benben's predecessor on ''L.A. Story'' meet his end. He does a story at the zoo and is crushed to death by a lovelorn ape. His funeral is crammed with people he has covered, including Professor Kazoo and Miss Garlic. Now all that is Benben's. Beneath this silliness, though, Benben shares much of the sardonic attitude of Martin Tupper. The series' tone is set by his vindictive attitude toward his gloating replacement, Chad Rockwell (Charles Esten), who is evil but happens to have great hair. With its surface giddiness and sight gags and its undertone of mordant wit, ''The Brian Benben Show'' plays better than it sounds and is much sharper than CBS's lame promos for it suggest. It is not the most hyped series of the season, but could turn out to be one of the most enjoyable. THE BRIAN BENBEN SHOW CBS, tonight at 9:30. (Channel 2 in New York) Robert Borden, creator, executive producer and writer (pilot); Brian Benben, co-executive producer; Pamela Grant, producer; Mark Heyes, music.

VHeroin use and the injection of drugs have declined sharply among young people who were arrested in Manhattan and some other urban centers, according to a survey of their drug habits. The survey by Dr. Bruce D. Johnson and Dr. Andrew Golub, sociological researchers who chart the drug culture of New York City's streets, was presented this weekend at a conference of policy specialists, historians and medical experts, who gathered at Yale University to review the notorious rise of heroin since it was introduced to the world 100 years ago as a cough syrup.

VEven as the nation watched President Clinton on videotape today, many members of Congress on both sides of the aisle had already decided that he lied under oath. Now the question, which Congress is already starting to debate, is whether that is grounds for impeachment. Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, certainly seemed to think so. In his report to Congress, he held that perjury and obstruction of justice by any citizen ''are profoundly serious matters'' and that ''when such acts are committed by the President of the United States, we believe these acts 'may constitute grounds for an impeachment.' '' But the Constitution's description of an impeachable offense as treason, bribery and other ''high crimes and misdemeanors'' is subject to continual reinterpretation.

VWhen the first babies were born to crack addicts in the mid-1980's, images of trembling infants with tubes up their noses led to fears that such children were irreversibly damaged and doomed to grow into violent misfits. The dire predictions failed to materialize by the early 1990's, prompting a different conclusion: that cocaine causes no lingering effects on children born to drug-addicted mothers. Instead, it was asserted, whatever problems the children had could be attributed to poverty and other environmental factors.

VIn a new case raising friction between American and Mexican law enforcement officials, two Mexican drug enforcement agents are in jail here on kidnapping charges that appear to have been trumped up by corrupt police officers working with traffickers. The two Mexican agents, part of an elite anti-drug unit that works closely with United States officials, were preparing to buy a ton of marijuana from Tijuana traffickers as part of a buy-and-bust operation when they were arrested by Baja California state policemen who were summoned by one of the traffickers.

And now they are being hunted down and killed by drug traffickers. The violence began two years ago when the leader of an indigenous village that resisted traffickers' efforts to take over communal lands for drug cultivation was gunned down, along with another Indian, in an ambush along a rural road.

VWHILE waiting for Mr. Livestock last week, I felt the anger rise in my throat like mercury in a thermometer. I have bigger problems these days, so it helped to fixate on a small one like Mr. Livestock's inspection of my building for a new insurance policy. As the co-op board president, I had arranged the inspection, but I also had a more personal stake; the old policy did not cover sewer or flood damage, both of which I have suffered lately. I assumed Mr. Livestock would find faults in the building, write it off as 12 units of self-mismanagement, a ship of fools whose elected captain, me, couldn't steer a shopping cart into a checkout lane. Mercury rising, I would have canceled his visit, but when he called that morning to re-confirm I was at the Wiz, winding up to throw my new cordless phone through the store's front window. Only two weeks old, the phone had made what I considered a pointed decision: it turned me mute. I could hear clearly enough, but no one heard me. It did little for my mood that a Mr. Oswald Samuels, politely and professionally, gave me a new phone with the briefest of discussions. No release of rage there.

VSAUL WILLIAMS walked into the Antique Boutique in Greenwich Village as though it were his old neighborhood. He had the same comfortable, long-limbed stride his poet-rapper character in ''Slam,'' this year's Sundance grand prize winner, used while walking around the projects in Washington. Brushing past rows of sweaters and pants in all the New York colors -- black, charcoal, gray -- he stopped in the middle of the floor, at a rack he seemed to know well. ''This is it,'' he said, pulling a house-brand sweatpants-gray, wool-blend sweater with a zippered neck from out of the pack.

It was already the sixth inning at Yankee Stadium, but Theresa Hales, a k a Mom, wasn't really drunk, no matter what the other Bleacher Creatures were chanting. Sure, she'd had a sip or two of the frozen cocktail that somebody was passing around in souvenir plastic cups. But if she was reeling a little -- and she was not the only one -- it might have been from the hot afternoon sun.

VIt has been a roller-coaster year for Germany's environmentalist Greens. They have zigzagged on German troop deployment in Bosnia, called for a near-tripling of gasoline prices, only to shelve the idea, gone back and forth on what to do about NATO and finally found themselves a likely member of Germany's new government. ''We have shown a certain amount of chaos,'' said Harald Handel, a spokesman for the party that seems almost certain to form a ''Red-Green'' coalition with the Social Democrats of Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroder. ''The chaos was a reflection of a lack of organization, and we now intend to change that.''

The beige offices are ''very Lou Grant,'' Mr. Smith says, but they have unmistakable Lou Reed overtones: the sound of a pounding guitar drifts from somewhere, piles of books and papers litter the floors, and young editors meet in well-worn concert T-shirts.

VUntil very recently, the pitch for a contemporary movie celebrating the life-saving power of poetry would have been laughed out of every Hollywood studio. Hail, hail, the conquering poet? Please, you must be kidding. But the rising popularity of competitive ''slams,'' in which poetry, rap, performance art and stand-up comedy converge and ignite has redefined a literary form traditionally associated with bearded bohemians and nebbishy bookworms. And in much the same way that ''Saturday Night Fever'' created a boom by conferring a macho glamour on disco, Marc Levin's stirring pop fable ''Slam'' elevates rhythmically charged, fervently incantatory street poetry into a redemptive sport.

VMARC LEVIN'S feature film ''Slam'' is a vivid marriage of ideas usually seen as contradictions: documentary and fiction, action and poetry, black and white. ''Slam,'' which opens here on Friday after being shown at the New York Film Festival, is the story of a young black performance poet, Raymond Joshua (Saul Williams), who is imprisoned on a petty drug charge but who manages to establish his identity and his voice within the maelstrom of a Washington jail. As indicated by the punning title, the premise of ''Slam'' is itself unusual: not often are jail (the ''slammer'') and the spoken-word scene (''slams'' are competitive poetry performances) linked together. The film is actually fiction, though it gains a graphic documentary quality from having been shot mainly at the District of Columbia's Detention Facility. Both hard-driving and entertaining, with its poetry and a hip-hop soundtrack, ''Slam'' won prizes at both the Sundance and Cannes film festivals.

VBY THE LIGHT OF MY FATHER'S SMILE By Alice Walker 225 pages. Random House. $22.95. Alice Walker's best-known novel, ''The Color Purple,'' for which she won the Pulitzer Prize and the American Book Award in 1983, placed her in the literary pantheon, as a writer who spoke in searingly dramatic terms of the struggle of black women against both racism and the violence of patriarchal society. Ms. Walker has continued, with less noteworthy results, to spin variations on this theme. Her latest offering, ''By the Light of My Father's Smile,'' is a strong indication that, if she hasn't exhausted the subject, she is exhausting her readers with what has by now become a mannered and tendentious litany of New Age cliches.

VAmerican officials announced today that drug and money-laundering charges had been filed against Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, the brother of a Mexican trafficker who died last year, and they said Mr. Carrillo had assumed control of the drug-smuggling cartel once led by his brother. But some American law-enforcement officials disputed the suggestion that a 15-month struggle for control of the cartel has ended, arguing that several violent factions continue to battle for control.

VA 15-YEAR-OLD resident of Leake and Watts Services, a child-care agency here for troubled young people, was talking about his life before he came to live on the agency's campus. ''I was in foster homes, and this one foster home I didn't like, so I took a knife and put it under my bed,'' he said. ''If I'd known that just doing that, just putting a knife under my bed, would have gotten me here, I wouldn't have done it. I have a really bad temper. My temper doesn't have to do with my mouth. It's my hands. I break stuff. I break windows with my hands. But I'm working on it. I'm working on it, and I'm working it out on the ABC course.''

VTHE CLINTON ENIGMA: A Four-and-a-Half Minute Speech Reveals This President's Entire Life By David Maraniss 110 pages. Simon & Schuster. $17. THE DEATH OF OUTRAGE Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals By William J. Bennett 154 pages. The Free Press. $20. The more David Maraniss writes about Bill Clinton the more he seems to dislike him. In a series of articles for The Washington Post in 1992, Mr. Maraniss wrote of candidate Clinton's ''political stamina,'' his ''natural and deserved'' popularity, his ''empathetic personality,'' his ''intense desire to listen to people.'' ''The loyalty and deep feelings of respect that Clinton has engendered in scores of friends,'' he added, ''cannot be overstated.'' Though these articles formed the basis of Mr. Maraniss's 1995 biography of Mr. Clinton, ''First in His Class,'' that book evinced a significant shift in tone. The President's ''lifelong sense of purpose'' now read, more clearly, as ambition; his distaste for conflict, as glibness and a need to present people with ''the version of himself he thought each would most admire.''

VThere are two things that listening to ''Electro-Shock Blues,'' the second album by the Eels, makes one want to say when talking to E (formerly Mark Oliver Everett), the band's singer, songwriter and guitarist. The first is ''I'm sorry''; the second is ''congratulations.'' The first response is out of sympathy for the recent tragedies that inspired the album: the suicide of his sister, the diagnosis of terminal cancer for his mother, the deaths of several friends and, years earlier, the heart attack of his father, whom E discovered dead. The second response is out of admiration that E, on the verge of becoming the only surviving member of his immediate family, managed to create such a beautiful, profound and moving album out of these losses. '' 'I'm sorry, congratulations,' is the card I'd like to get from people,'' E said in an interview on Tuesday. ''That's why I called it 'Electro-Shock Blues.' The electro-shock part is based on the experiences my sister had in the mental hospital, and the blues part is because -- though it's not blues music per se -- it's what blues singers do. They take seemingly negative situations and turn them into something positive by processing them and telling people the story.''

VDefense lawyers and prosecutors jousted for the first time yesterday over the defense's charges of drug use by Jonathan M. Levin, the popular Bronx high school teacher who prosecutors say was killed by a former student. The former student, Corey Arthur, told the police after his arrest that he was in Mr. Levin's apartment to sell him crack cocaine when two armed men arrived. Mr. Arthur, who has denied committing the killing, said he managed to escape from the apartment when the gunmen came in.

VThe pop makeover of the year belongs to Vanilla Ice, the rapper and one-album wonder of the early 1990's. As late as the summer of 1997, he was still performing his hit ''Ice, Ice Baby'' the way he did it in 1991, when he joined M. C. Hammer as a dancing, grimacing rapper packaged for MTV. In his brief heyday as a rapper for teeny-boppers, he sold millions of albums, but at the price of becoming a hip-hop punch line. Now there's a setup for a new joke: Vanilla Ice, the tormented rocker. As a pre-emptive strike, his new album is called ''Hard to Swallow'' (Republic/Universal). Groping for credibility, Vanilla Ice unveiled his hard-rock persona on Tuesday night at CBGB, a club chosen for its history as a punk and hardcore epicenter. He had a new look, from his goatee and short, blond-frosted hair to his sleeveless CBGB T-shirt; luckily, tattoos are still apropos for what he called skate rock. And while he had a disk jockey scratching records behind him, Vanilla Ice was also backed by a funk-metal band that churned, stomped and squealed.

VChuck Schumer had just graduated from Harvard Law School, earning a passport to the kind of wealth and freedom from worry that his parents could only imagine, when he broke the news to them that he had hatched a different plan. As the family drove from the courtyards of Cambridge, Mass., back to their narrow three-bedroom house in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Abe and Selma Schumer's oldest son announced that he would not hunker down to study for the bar exam. Instead, he would wake before dawn to stand outside subway stations. He would stay out past dusk to ring doorbells. There was an open seat representing his area of Brooklyn in the New York State Assembly, and Mr. Schumer intended to win it.

VA man who was shot to death by the police on Sunday night after walking bare-chested into a Queens station house and attacking officers with a screwdriver and a kitchen knife had a long history of psychiatric problems and had recently complained to his mother about ''the Devil,'' law enforcement officials said yesterday. The troubled life of the man, Kevin Cerbelli, 30, ended shortly before 9 P.M., just minutes after he walked into the 110th Precinct station house at 91-41 43d Avenue in Elmhurst, stabbed one officer in the back with the screwdriver, lunged at others with the knife and ignored several orders to drop his weapons, said Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman.

VA former girlfriend of Corey Arthur, the young man accused of torturing and fatally shooting his former high school English teacher, testified yesterday that Mr. Arthur confessed the killing to her. The former girlfriend, Carlethia Weeks, 24, said that Mr. Arthur first alluded to the shooting of the teacher, Jonathan M. Levin, over the telephone, saying he had done ''something bad.'' Then, she said, she met with Mr. Arthur on June 4, 1997, and he admitted that he had fatally shot Mr. Levin in the teacher's apartment on the Upper West Side on May 30.

Commissioner David Stern and representatives from all 29 teams will meet with Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing and as many as 200 of their peers today at a midtown Manhattan hotel. The meeting represents the best hope for the two sides to try to work out a revenue-sharing plan.

VThe trial of the former student accused of killing Jonathan M. Levin turned to the intricacies of scientific evidence yesterday as a forensic expert testified that DNA evidence linked the student to the knife used in the attack and showed that his clothes had been stained with his former teacher's blood. But defense lawyers for the former student, Corey Arthur, 20, seized on another piece of the expert's testimony: that some of the DNA found on the knife could not have come from their client, another man charged in the attack or the victim. The defense has contended that other unknown people took part in the attack and shot Mr. Levin.

The defendant, Derrick Smith, 19, rejected the plea bargain. Then, as court officers were leading him to a holding cell behind the courtroom, Mr. Smith, who was not handcuffed, broke free and jumped out an open window, shaken witnesses said.

VThe illicit drug ecstasy may cause long-lasting nerve cell damage in the brains of heavy users, according to a report published yesterday by scientists at Johns Hopkins University. The study compared the brain scans of 14 men and women who reported having used the drug from 70 to 400 times with the scans of control subjects who said they had never used it. The heavy users of ecstasy, or MDMA, showed a significant decrease in brain cells responsible for reabsorbing serotonin, a messenger chemical involved in mood, appetite, pain perception, sexual drive and memory. People who take ecstasy on a recreational basis ''are unwittingly putting themselves at risk,'' the scientists said.

VWith polls indicating that ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana for medical use might pass next Tuesday in some states, Barry R. McCaffrey, the retired Army general who is White House director of drug control policy, figured it was time to throw more troops into the fight. So he enlisted three former Presidents -- George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford -- and asked them to write a ''Dear Fellow Citizen'' letter that would point out why the initiatives should be defeated. The letter arrived on Wednesday and is being distributed to news outlets and antimarijuana forces in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, where polls show most voters support the initiatives. It also has been sent to Nevada and the District of Columbia, where passage is more in doubt.

VThey are fed up with the negative tone of the campaign. When attack ads appear on television, they turn them off. They feel deprived of any real debate on the issues, and some are even prepared to use their votes to push other political agendas. For the undecided, enthusiasm for a candidate will not play a large part as they vote on Tuesday for the United States senator from New York. And with the race locked in a dead heat since primary day, the factors that tip their vote in one direction or another could decide the election -- one of the most expensive and contentious political contests in the country.

VEven in Greenwich Village, no one knew quite what to make of it. It was a chilly Halloween night in 1974 and through the narrow streets came a procession that looked something like a cross between a Happening and a medieval mystery play. There was a man in a seven-foot-tall lobster suit, borrowed from a Sam Shepard play. There was a two-headed pig monster and a giant lizard. The 200 marchers paused to wage a mock battle between good and evil on the steps of the Washington Square Methodist Church, and then wandered across to the park and wondered what else to do.

VHalloween parade in Greenwich Village has turned into major event, with estimated 2 million spectators expected; many gay participants who once figured prominently in celebration complain that it has no only lost its neighborhood spirit, but also its uniquely gay New York character; many gay leaders say parade has begun to reflect something more troubling: rise in anti-gay sentiment in the city and across the country; map; photos (M)

When the sea is calm, as many as 500 boat people reach the neighboring coast. Many of the fugitives from Albania, Iraq and Kosovo are pushed or thrown from bobbing rubber rafts by ruthless Albanian smugglers eager to escape the police.

Barely visible from the road, a stone-and-iron gate marks the passage to the walled-off world Camby seldom leaves at night. It is better this way. If there is anything Camby has learned in his turbulent two years in the National Basketball Association, it is this: It's harder for trouble to find you if it does not know where you are.

Then there are the whethers: whether to ban most forms of state-sponsored affirmative action; whether to approve the use of marijuana for medical purposes; whether to make it a felony crime to terminate ''a fetus's life during the process of birth''; and whether to raise the state's minimum wage and, for the first time in any state, require automatic future increases tied to the inflation rate. In California, voters have another dizzying array of choices, including a measure to expand Indian casino gambling that has sparked the most costly campaign battle over a ballot initiative in the nation's history.

VThe State of Iowa asked the Supreme Court today to uphold a state law that gives the police essentially blanket authority to search a car after issuing the driver a citation for speeding or another routine traffic violation. The Iowa Supreme Court upheld the law, the only one of its kind, by a 5-to-4 vote last year. But the Justices responded today with considerable wariness to the state's arguments. Justices across the ideological spectrum worried aloud that an expansion of the current rule, under which the police can conduct a search as an aspect of taking a person into custody in a formal arrest, would give the police too much power.

VPatty Murray, a Democrat, became the state's first female Senator in 1992 -- and made a nationwide name for herself -- campaigning as the ''mom in tennis shoes'' who understood family issues. This year she had tough competition from another woman, Representative Linda Smith, a Republican with backing from the Christian right who got to the House in 1994 by unseating another Democratic incumbent. And in this, the third woman-versus-woman Senate race in history, Ms. Smith had the down-to-earth sound bites about ''fighting against leches in the workplace who hit on young women,'' making President Clinton an issue. Ms. Smith paid a price for her longstanding support for campaign finance reform: the Republican organization gave her little money, and she was noticeably outspent early in the campaign.

VIn a remarkable night for a once dying breed, Southern Democrats regained governorships in Alabama and South Carolina, held on to the governorship of Georgia, defeated an incumbent Republican senator in North Carolina, and kept a Senate seat in South Carolina, according to partial vote tallies and surveys of voters leaving the polls. Whether Tuesday's results suggest a new bipartisan balance or simply a pause in a two-decade trend toward Republicanization remains to be seen. Several of the Southern races were influenced by unique factors, including flawed Republican candidates and the one-time appeal of lotteries proposed by Democratic candidates. But at least here in Alabama, which had been all but written off as Republican turf, Democratic strength extended past the race for governor and into other contests for statewide offices and judgeships.

VGiving a major lift to critics of affirmative action, Washington State voters tonight appear to have soundly approved an initiative that would ban most state-supported forms of the policy. They did so two years after California voters made theirs the first state in the nation to do so, and the vote is almost certain to spur efforts in other states. With 38 percent of precincts reporting, the measure known as Initiative 200 was running ahead, 60 percent to 40 percent. Under the measure's wording, the state ''shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin'' in education, employment or contracting.

In the third woman-versus-woman Senate race in history, Ms. Smith was known for down-to-earth sound bites, like when she spoke of ''fighting against leches in the workplace who hit on young women,'' a reference to President Clinton.

VDefying Federal officials, and often state legislators, voters approved initiatives on Tuesday to legalize the medical use of marijuana in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington State. And in Colorado and the District of Columbia, where conservatives nullified medical marijuana initiatives at the last moment, surveys of voters leaving the polls on Tuesday indicated strong support for the measures.

VTwo incumbent Democrats, Gov. John Kitzhaber and Senator Ron Wyden, racked up big margins in their victories. But the contest for the state's First Congressional District remained too close to call. Governor Kitzhaber, who emphasized his support for education and the environment, soundly defeated the Republican, Bill Sizemore, who heads an anti-tax organization. In the Senate contest, Mr. Wyden easily overcame a challenge from State Senator John Lim, a Republican.

Voters in five Western states gave a resounding yes to the medical use of marijuana, while Alaska and Hawaii voters said a clear no to the idea of same-sex marriages. Massachusetts and Arizona voters approved public financing of political campaigns, while Colorado and Washington rejected proposals to criminalize late-term abortions. And Oregon, becoming the first state to do away with polling places altogether, will conduct elections entirely by mail.

VThe Horse Whisperer Robert Redford's adaptation takes the scenic route around some of the soapier elements of Nicholas Evans's novel. When Grace (Scarlett Johansson) and her horse are grievously injured in an accident, her mother, Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas), drives them to Montana, where they are taken in hand by Tom Booker (Mr. Redford, above), a genteel cowpoke. A chilly New York magazine editor, Annie has a hard time letting go in Big Sky country. Booker is a charming fellow in an admirably decent kind of way, which grows on Annie. But Mr. Redford's direction and restrained portrayal keeps the focus on nursing the girl and the horse, which doesn't slam the door on romance but keeps it on a reserved adult level. The film's one sin is its excessive length, which might be excused, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, by ''the material's uncompromising spirit and tranquil tone.''

VAn 84-year-old man's willingness to give his nephew and the nephew's girlfriend a ride evolved into a bizarre carjacking today in Newark that ended with the woman shot to death and the nephew mysteriously vanishing on the George Washington Bridge. Police officials said the shot that killed the woman was fired by a security guard at a Newark housing project who was trying to stop the carjacking. Her body was found in the car, a green Ford Taurus, after it was abandoned on the eastbound lanes of the bridge's lower level. The police identified her only as a New York woman in her 20's.

VA 19-year-old former student of Jonathan M. Levin was convicted yesterday of second-degree murder in the May 1997 slaying of Mr. Levin, a Bronx public high school teacher, in his Upper West Side apartment. But in a setback for prosecutors, the jury acquitted the defendant, Corey Arthur, of first-degree murder, apparently unconvinced that Mr. Arthur fired the fatal shot. Mr. Arthur faces 25 years to life in prison. If he had been convicted of first-degree murder, he would have been sentenced to life in prison without parole.

VA massacre in September in which 19 men, women and children were fatally shot in a driveway in Baja California was a result of a drunken argument between the chieftains of two rival marijuana-smuggling gangs that turned violent, the authorities said today. In the murders on Sept. 17 in a seaside suburb of Ensenada, the authorities had previously identified a victim, Fermin Castro, as head of a gang that specialized in guiding drug planes to desert airstrips.

VA police report that is part of a dispute between prosecutors and a defense lawyer in the trial of a teen-ager accused of killing a 44-year-old man in Central Park in 1997 provides previously undisclosed details about the relationship between the victim and one of his attackers. Arnold Kriss, the lawyer for the teen-ager, Christopher Vasquez, said on Tuesday that he wants parts of the report and other statements about the killing made by Mr. Vasquez's co-defendant, Daphne Abdela, read to the jury. But the lead prosecutor, Matthew Bogdanos, objected. Arguments on the issue are expected to be made today before Judge Michael Corriero in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.

VA day after convicting Corey Arthur of second-degree murder in the shooting of his former teacher, Jonathan M. Levin, shaken members of the jury yesterday described two days of agonizing deliberations that culminated in the realization that they could not declare Mr. Arthur guilty of actually pulling the trigger. Three jurors said yesterday that the panel -- made up of nine women and three men -- was initially evenly divided over whether to convict him of the first-degree murder charge, which would have meant prosecutors proved he fired the fatal shot. But after 11 hours of debate, the jury unanimously agreed that Mr. Arthur could be convicted only on the lesser charge of second-degree murder because of the inconsistent testimony of the prosecution's lead witness, Carlethia Weeks, who said that Mr. Arthur told her he shot Mr. Levin.

VFor want of an estimated $1.64 in this city's perennial home-rule struggle with Congress, the Election Day result of a ballot initiative proposing the medicinal use of marijuana is being kept sealed as a secret from local voters. ''Every year, we sit and wait, wondering what Congress is going to do to us this time,'' said Mary Jane DeFrank, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of the National Capital Area. ''Now we know,'' she said, attacking Congress's 11th-hour move to void the Nov. 3 marijuana initiative by passing an appropriations amendment that bars the city from spending even the smallest amount of money to tally and promulgate the result.

VArrests on marijuana charges have jumped to a record number this year, driven by the Giuliani administration's ''zero tolerance'' approach that has police officers pursuing anyone found possessing, selling or smoking even small amounts of marijuana. At its current pace, the New York City Police Department could arrest as many as 40,000 people by the end of the year on charges of possessing or selling marijuana, according to police statistics. That would be eight times the number of arrests just six years ago.

VQ. Voters in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have approved initiatives to legalize marijuana for medical use. Does this application encourage marijuana abuse? ALISHA BERGER YES To answer that, you have to assume that there is medical marijuana. There is no scientific proof of that yet. It has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and there have been no reputable studies that propose to demonstrate marijuana's medicinal qualities.. It has not gone forward because Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of California at San Francisco, who is conducting the only accepted study, has to recruit subjects for a double blind study. But the only thing participants can take while battling AIDS or cancer is marijuana. Naturally, participants' willingness is limited. In one study that compared marijuana to Marinol -- the active ingredient in the marijuana plant -- patients preferred Marinol. It is premature to refer to medicinal marijuana. The seduction of medical marijuana makes it seem that marijuana is both harmless and beneficial. That sends a bad message and encourages abuse. In the 1970's, Alaska allowed home use of marijuana. There was a marked increase of use by young people and a rise in child crime. JIM McDONOUGH Director of Strategy for the White House Drug Control Office NO Voters recognized a difference between the medical use of marijuana and abuse. As with other medicine, the distinction between abuse and legitimate use is clear. In addition, legitimate medical use of marijuana has been supported by The New England Journal of Medicine. Medical marijuana controls nausea for cancer and AIDS patients, reduces spasms for paraplegia and neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis and controls eye pressure for glaucoma patients. Among test patients in the Federal Investigational New Drug program, which dispenses medical marijuana, there have been no cases of abuse, and some patients have been receiving marijuana for two decades. In terms of the broader social ramifications, California is our best case study. Recent figures from the Department of Health and Human Services show that teen-agers in California are actually less likely to abuse marijuana: 6.9 percent of California teen-agers 12 to 17 used marijuana often, while 9.9 percent of teen-agers nationally used it frequently. SAM VAGENAS Executive Director, National Council for Drug Control

VA Federal judge struck down New York City's law governing permits for parades and rallies yesterday, saying it was unconstitutional because it lacked firm guidelines for when the police must respond to requests for permits. Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that the city law violated First Amendment guarantees of free speech because, without safeguards like specific time limits for a response to applications, the law does not sufficiently restrict the risk of censorship by city officials.

VPeople who hold views unpopular with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his administration routinely have to go to court to win the right to hold marches in New York City. This week a Federal District Court judge struck down the city's parade permit law as unconstitutional. Judge Leonard Sand found that the law violated First Amendment rights because it sets no time limits on when the Police Department must act on a permit request. In reviewing more than 20 parade requests, the court found that some groups got a quick response. But others were made to wait for weeks or months before getting an answer. In the case before the court, the Million Marijuana March Organization sought a parade permit last January and was finally denied the request in April. The court was particularly disturbed by the delayed treatment of two requests to march against police brutality. The lack of a time frame creates the danger that delay could be used to censor speech.

VLawrence Gould used to settle into his midcourt seat at the old Coliseum in Cleveland as if it were a favorite easy chair. It was comfortable and familiar, and it made it easy to sit through a Cavaliers loss, no matter how lopsided, as long as he was surrounded by the friends he had been cheering beside for two decades. But like many teams in the National Basketball Association, the Cavaliers found it hard to resist the allure of fancier digs to woo the corporate dollar. The Gund Arena, a handsome structure that helped provide a facelift to downtown Cleveland, was opened in 1994. Soon Gould found himself in a plush $90 club seat in an arena filled with enough amenities to please a technophile.

VGiants defensive tackle Keith Hamilton was stopped by Port Authority police for speeding on the George Washington Bridge early Monday morning and later charged with possession of marijuana, driving under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to the Port Authority police spokesman Bill Cahill. Hamilton was stopped at 1:30 A.M. for driving 71 miles an hour on the westbound lower level of the bridge, where the speed limit is 45 miles an hour, Cahill said. Hamilton was not carrying a driver's license or an insurance card, and the police said they found on Hamilton a bag that appeared to contain less than an ounce of marijuana and a pipe.

VGLORIA DENARD is a jazz singer, so she knows how to improvise. Thirty-one years ago she relied more on ingenuity than income to start Manna House Workshops, an East Harlem school dedicated to jazz and dance. Grants helped her buy a five-story building on East 106th Street, where the school occupies the first two floors and the rest are rented to tenants. One was Jason Adams, who moved there in 1989. Last year, he became the building's handyman, giving new meaning to that job title. He was a big brother to the school's students and took them to movies or on trips to the park. He bought flowers for the ladies in the building and tucked Christmas cards under everyone's door. Using his own money, he even paid the neighborhood youths who helped him clean the building.

VA big flashing sign spelled out ''DRUGS'' on the stage of the Hammerstein Ballroom on Monday night. And Marilyn Manson, wearing a sparkly red outfit with garters, thigh-high boots and a codpiece-thong combination that left his buttocks bare, did his parody of a preacher, declaring that God spoke to him and said that Jesus Christ invented marijuana, cocaine and LSD. Determined to offend both church and state, Mr. Manson was trying hard to hold on to his role as the corrupter of American youth. American youth may have other ideas, like treating him as mere entertainment. Mr. Manson is already facing the predicament of anyone who builds a career on shock value: shocks wear off fast. Two years ago, when he released ''Antichrist Superstar'' (Nothing/Interscope), he titillated fans and scandalized fundamentalists by tearing up Bibles and miming sex acts, while Internet rumors built his aura by portraying his shows as orgies of raw sex and bloody sacrifices. It was easy to miss the skepticism -- about stardom, demagoguery and the hard sell -- that was also part of the songs, and Mr. Manson thrived on the notoriety. But he couldn't top it.

VThe Minnesota Vikings have no secret weapon. Their big play is the bomb. Every team throws it, but none use it with such devastating results. ''Everyone has it in their game plan, but we throw it even when it's covered,'' said Viking quarterback Randall Cunningham, the highest-rated quarterback in the National Football League. ''We have guys who are willing to go up and get it.''

VEUROPE RUSSIA: FINANCIAL WOES PERSIST The arrival of a World Bank team for more talks about loans did little to assuage fears that Russia will be left without foreign aid and may begin printing large sums of money to pay off a total foreign currency debt of $158.8 billion by January. (AP) BRITAIN: TORY BACKS DOWN ON KEY PLAN William Hague, the leader of Britain's Conservatives, has abandoned plans to press for a new regional Parliament to represent England. The proposal, a centerpiece of his program at the annual party convention two months ago, was aimed at being a counterweight to the new Parliaments that the Labor Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair has created in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Warren Hoge (NYT) GERMANY: CALL FOR EAST GERMAN AMNESTY Leaders of the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to the Communists who governed the former East Germany, have called for an amnesty on crimes committed under Communist rule. The party's leader, Lothar Bisby, questioned whether people carrying out the law of East Germany, from border guards upward, should be liable to prosecution. Nearly 1,000 people were killed trying to flee to the West. (Reuters) MIDDLE EAST IRAN: KHATAMI SPEAKS OUT ON REFORMS President Mohammad Khatami, who was elected last year on promises of ushering in political reforms, accused conservative and traditionalist forces of blocking reforms in Iran. ''We are facing the three currents of counter-revolution, traditionalists hostile to progressive religion and revisionists,'' he told an assembly hall packed with 10,000 student supporters at Sharif University, Teheran. (Agence France-Presse) EGYPT: MOVE ON MINI-MOSQUES The Ministry of Religious Endowments said it began putting into action a plan to control 6,000 ''zawya,'' or mini-mosques, in an attempt to put an end to Muslim fundamentalism. The ministry will appoint prayer leaders to the mosques, a spokesman said. (Agence France-Presse) ASIA INDIA: STANDING FIRM ON KASHMIR On his first visit to Kashmir since becoming Prime Minister of India in March, Atal Behari Vajpayee said India would never relinquish any of it to Pakistan. Celia W. Dugger (NYT) CHINA: ACID RAIN DAMAGE GROWS China's rapid economic growth and reliance on coal have spread acid rain damage to 40 percent of the country, The China Daily reported. According to a new report by Chinese scientists, China emitted 23.5 million tons of sulfur dioxide last year, up 30 percent from 1993, and coal use doubled to comprise 75 percent of total energy consumption. (AP) NORTH KOREA: TALKS WITH U.S. CONTINUE The United States and North Korea resumed talks in Washington on an American demand for access to an underground building site that could be connected with a revived nuclear program in North Korea. The negotiators met in New York on Friday and Saturday, with their agenda restricted to Washington's insistence that North Korea allow inspections of the site at the village of Kumchang-ri. (Reuters) JAPAN: ECONOMY IN 'SEVERE STATE' The head of the Bank of Japan said Japan's economy remains in ''an extremely severe state.'' The central bank governor, Masaru Hayami, told Parliament that corporate earnings had slipped and industrial production had fallen. (AP) AFRICA SOUTH AFRICA: ELECTION PLAN CHALLENGED The opposition National Party said it would ask the High Court to rule on the constitutionality of requiring citizens to have new ''bar-coded'' identity documents before they can register to vote in national elections next year. The ruling African National Congress is insisting on the documents, but that could result in fewer white voters getting to the polls because many have not applied for the new documents. Suzanne Daley (NYT) UGANDA: PRESIDENT'S BROTHER QUITS The brother of Uganda's President resigned as the nation's security adviser after admitting his involvement in a secret deal to buy a 49 percent interest in the Uganda Commercial Bank. Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, a military adviser to his brother, President Yoweri Museveni, has been criticized for corruption and the military's support of the rebellion in Congo. Ian Fisher (NYT) ANGOLA: REBELS TELL OF ATTACKS The rebel movement Unita said Government forces bombed its strongholds in the towns of Andulo and Bailundo in breach of a four-year peace treaty. Paulo Lukamba Gato, Unita's secretary general, told a Portuguese radio station that the attacks could signal a return to all-out fighting in Angola. (Reuters) THE AMERICAS ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES: MARIJUANA WAR Caribbean troops backed by six United States Marine Corps helicopters are beginning a two-week campaign to eradicate an estimated 12,000 acres of marijuana on St. Vincent, BBC News reported. It said the island's marijuana growers' association, warning that the destruction of the crop would drive up the island's 40 percent unemployment rate, has written to President Clinton demanding compensation. UNITED STATES: GORE'S GLOBAL CONFERENCE Vice President Gore is inviting law enforcement and other officials from more than 60 countries to what his office calls the world's first conference on fighting corruption and safeguarding integrity among justice and security officials. The conference is scheduled from Feb. 24 to 26 at the State Department. (NYT) Compiled by Christopher S. Wren

VA red bandanna is pinned over his bed, but 17-year-old Richard C. does not hang with the Bloods anymore. After five arrests and a probation violation, Richard was taken away from his gang a year ago and sent to a residential treatment facility called the Edwin Gould Academy. Now the onetime gang member, tall and lanky with delicate features that disguise a hair-trigger temper, is a peer group leader. His 12 new ''brothers'' are a lot like the guys he knew on the street: truants and graffiti makers, drug dealers and addicts, car thieves and shoplifters. But the new group is striving to reform. And while staff members at Edwin Gould Academy support their efforts, it is the students who lead.

VIssuing a speeding ticket does not automatically give the police the authority to search the car, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today in rejecting the latest invitation from law-enforcement officials to expand the powers of the police in encounters with motorists. The Court held that the police in Iowa violated a driver's constitutional rights by conducting a full search of his car based on nothing more than a speeding violation, for which the police issued a citation. The search turned up marijuana and led to the man's conviction on state narcotics charges.

VThe Oregon Appeals Court upheld Portland Trail Blazers guard Isaiah Rider's 1997 marijuana conviction yesterday, saying there was clear evidence the player was in possession of the drug while a passenger in a car stopped by a sherrif's deputy in Lake Oswego two years ago. The three-judge panel unanimously said the evidence showed Rider possessed less than an ounce of marijuana, a non-criminal violation in Oregon carrying a minimum fine of $500.

VYosef Y. Kazen, a Hasidic rabbi who pioneered the use of the Internet as a powerful recruiting and educational tool for the Lubavitch movement, died Dec. 1 at New York Hospital. He was 44 and lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The cause was complications of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, said Moshe Kotlarski, his brother-in-law and the development director at the Lubavitch World Headquarters in Brooklyn.

VA United Nations agency has reported that the illegal cultivation of marijuana, popularly known in southern Africa as ''Malawi Gold,'' has rapidly increased in Malawi because of the prices the crop can fetch. The agency, the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, which serves as a planning arm for all United Nations development funds, said in a report released this week that a study conducted last year showed that 385,000 acres in Malawi were devoted to the cultivation of marijuana, or cannabis.

VEUROPE POLAND: OPENING SECRET FILES Polish legislators, overriding the veto of President Alexander Kwasniewski, pushed through a bill opening access to the files of the Communist-era secret police. The bill will allow Poles who felt they were the victims of Communist repression to see personal files compiled by the authorities before 1989 and determine if they were discriminated against and possibly who informed against them. (Reuters) GERMANY: A BREAK FOR DESERTERS Germany gave World War II deserters and their families another year to apply for a onetime payment of $4,500. Parliament offered compensation in May 1997 to men convicted by the Nazis of fleeing Hitler's army, after years of debate about whether they were heroes or traitors. Since then, 2,124 people have applied. (AP)

But his attitude changed after a private, two-hour tutoring session with a Hofstra University English literature major. ''It was cool,'' said Jaytin.

VAS Benjamin Middleton Jr. and his son approach the corner of Marcus Garvey Boulevard and Hancock Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, their pace quickens. Casting an edgy glance around and noticing the drug dealers on their usual turf, Mr. Middleton automatically shifts his hand from his son's head and loops it protectively around his shoulder. Until then, the banter between father and son on the short walk home from school had been playful, frisky.

On the other side, invoking images of ''lynch mobs'' and ''good old boys,'' they warned of a right-wing coup. From one camp came allusions to Watergate that found similarities between the transgressions of Presidents Nixon and Clinton. From the other came gasps that such analogies were ludicrous.

VAfter rising since the early 1990's, the use of marijuana and other drugs by teen-agers may be ebbing, however modestly, according to a new survey that is considered the most reliable gauge of substance abuse among secondary school students. The annual survey of nearly 50,000 students around the country, titled Monitoring the Future, was conducted at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan and released on Friday. Though the levels of drug and alcohol use remain higher than several years ago, the survey reported, all grades studied showed a slight but often statistically significant drop in overall drug use in the previous 12 months.

VFor the pagan set, this year's celebration of the winter solstice was brewing with all the right energy. They had called out to Mother Earth while on the ferry to Staten Island. Sure, the forgotten borough was not the mythic Celtic paradise of Avalon, but its beaches were an acceptable stand-in for their annual rites. Chanting ''reverence, reverence, reverence'' to the ancient rhythms of their drums and tambourines, they had gathered Monday night to dance around a bonfire, seeking to consign to the flames all the bad from past year, and conjure up the good for the year to come.

VEUROPE FRANCE: BRIBERY INQUIRY ENDS Investigating judges have completed their inquiry into Roland Dumas, head of France's highest administrative tribunal, the Constitutional Council, and his relationship while he was Foreign Minister with Christine Deviers-Joncour, a lobbyist for Elf-Aquitaine, the oil company. The two, as well as four former Elf Aquitaine executives, have three weeks to respond before prosecutors decide whether to try them on bribery charges. Craig R. Whitney (NYT) BRITAIN: CHARLES HEARS ABOUT MARIJUANA Prince Charles, left, renewed a debate about marijuana when he asked a woman with multiple sclerosis whether she had tried using it to relieve pain. British newspapers reported that Charles, visiting a day-care center in Cheltenham, had told the woman, Karen Drake, that he had heard that marijuana could benefit people with multiple sclerosis. (Reuters) RUSSIA: AUSTERITY BUDGET GAINS The Communist-dominated lower house of Parliament voted, 303 to 65, for initial approval for an austerity budget for 1999, after Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov had threatened to resign if the draft failed. The coffers are so bare that the budget calls for Government spending of $29 billion and revenues of $24 billion. The United States Government spends $30 billion a week. (AP) RUSSIA: 5 SUBCRITICAL A-TESTS Russia conducted five subcritical nuclear tests at an Arctic testing range in the autumn, Deputy Nuclear Energy Minister Lev Ryabev said, contradicting previous denials. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty does not prohibit such tests, because the amount of plutonium used cannot create a nuclear explosion. But critics say that even limited tests could encourage full-scale tests. (AP) BOSNIA: MILITARY AND SCALE OF AID The military consumes just about the total yearly aid to the country, said Ambassador Robert Barry of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Mr. Barry gave no specific figures. But Bosnia is receiving a $5.1 billion reconstruction package that international donors have agreed for the period from 1996 to 1999. (Reuters) MIDDLE EAST CYPRUS: TALKS ON USING RUSSIAN MISSILES President Glafcos Clerides will go to Athens next week for talks on whether to deploy a Russian-built missile system that Turkey has pledged to prevent on the divided island. Cyprus was said to be considering putting the S-300 missile systems temporarily on Crete, a move that Greece also reportedly favors. (Reuters) ISRAEL: BETHLEHEM SERVICE ON THE WEB The International Christian Embassy, an evangelical Protestant group in Jerusalem, introduced its Virtual Holyland Web site in time for a Christmas service today from Shepherd's Field near Bethlehem. The page is www.virtualholyland.com. Deborah Sontag (NYT) ASIA INDONESIA: MIDNIGHT MASS CANCELED The Roman Catholic Cathedral in Jakarta scrapped midnight Christmas Mass because of security fears after violence against the minority Christian population, an official at the Vatican Embassy said. (Agence France-Presse) JAPAN: TAX REMAINS STABLE The consumption tax will not rise despite an advisory panel's warning that an increase is inevitable, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said. Former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was widely blamed for pushing the world's second largest economy into recession by raising the tax last year, from 3 to 5 percent. (Agence France-Presse) CHINA: 11 DRUG DEALERS EXECUTED The special economic zone of Shenzhen executed 11 drug dealers, a local newspaper reported. The Intermediate People's Court sentenced 17 people for drug-related crimes, and the 11 given the death penalty were taken to be shot. Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, is a conduit for heroin refined in Yunnan. (Reuters) AFRICA SIERRA LEONE: LIBERIANS ASSIST SECURITY About 1,000 soldiers flew from Liberia to augment a West African intervention force around Freetown. The 5,000-member force is strengthening security after rebel attacks near the capital, United Nations observers said. (Agence France-Presse) ZAMBIA: REGIONAL MEETING POSTPONED A regional meeting in Lusaka on a cease-fire in Congo has been postponed because of the holiday season, an aide to President Frederick Chiluba said. (Agence France-Presse) THE AMERICAS MEXICO: INQUIRY ON PRI CAMPAIGN SPENDING Electoral authorities named a commission to investigate accusations of illegal spending in the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, campaign of 1994 that led to President Ernesto Zedillo's election.

VWith a stroke of the pen on Thursday, President Clinton removed the last hurdle standing between Kevin Lester Teker and his steadfast determination to become a rescue mission pilot with the Civil Air Patrol. The President pardoned Mr. Teker for a 1989 conviction of buying and detonating explosives, clearing his name with those of 32 others who also received acts of executive clemency on Christmas Eve. ''This is something that completes my greatest goal,'' Mr. Teker, 33, said by telephone from Seattle after a reporter informed him of the pardon. With it, he said, he can pass the background checks to become an active pilot for the Washington State Civil Air Patrol.

VShanika W., 15, did not get the Christmas gift she had wished for. She wanted to spend the holiday with her mother, but her mother is a drug addict and Shanika is not supposed to go home. Instead, Shanika, 15, an outgoing and intelligent girl, spent Christmas at Geller House, a center for children ages 11 to 15 who have been removed from their foster homes because of disciplinary problems and have nowhere else to go. Their problems are evaluated, they receive counseling, and eventually, they move to a less stringently supervised residential treatment center.

VA Long Island-based rap artist better known for colorful antics than for violent behavior was arrested Sunday night in Manhattan and charged with criminal possession of a weapon after the police said they found a loaded, unregistered .45-caliber pistol in his 1995 Mercedes-Benz. The performer, Trevor Smith, who goes by the stage name Busta Rhymes, faces up to seven years in jail if he is convicted of the weapons charge. His arrest comes a week after his new album made its debut at No. 13 on Billboard magazine's top 100 sales list.

VEvery winter, after flying south from the Eastern United States, millions of monarch butterflies festoon fir trees in the mountains of Mexico, creating one of the world's most dazzling and famous biological spectacles. But in spite of intense interest in these beloved insects, the details of their travels, like those of so many creatures that do not submit to tagging or to voyeuristic techniques like radio-transmitters, have largely remained a mystery. Now three new studies, including one released Dec. 22 on monarchs, herald the arrival of a powerful new technique that can identify, sometimes to within a few miles, where migrating animals -- from butterflies to mastodons to humans -- have been. The new technique takes advantage of different forms, known as isotopes, of chemical elements. Biologists have begun discovering that these isotopes, present in different amounts in different regions, can leave a distinctive chemical signature written in the feather of a bird or the wing of a butterfly.

VWhen Nigem D., a college freshman, thinks about the kind of life he could be leading, he remembers his friend Burnell. The last time he heard about him, Burnell was in jail on charges of drug possession. They met at the Pleasantville Residential Treatment Center in Westchester County, N.Y., when both were 14. They had been sent there by the Administration for Children's Services -- New York City's child welfare agency -- after causing disciplinary problems while in foster care. After a year at Pleasantville, they moved on to a group home in the Midwood section of Brooklyn.

VThousands of people who are not accused of any crime or who have completed prison terms for minor crimes spent this Christmas -- and may spend the next -- in jails around the nation. They are immigrants detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has filled its own detention centers and has now resorted to using local and county lockups. Hundreds of immigrants who are simply seeking political asylum share cells with people accused of violent crimes, and are often subject to abuse because they are foreigners. Keeping them in jails is cruel, unnecessary and a waste of money.

VNew York's New Year's Eve party was a cold, crowded and -- at one point -- smoky, but largely peaceful trial run for the celebration planned for next year to welcome in 2000, according to police officials. The 5,000 police officers who patrolled the party -- one of the largest police details in history -- made fewer arrests than the year before, 23 versus 30, officials said. Most of those arrested were people who took the spirit of celebration too far and were charged with disorderly conduct, the police said, but there were also two arrests for robbery and three for assault.

VAmid the sprawling fields, winding roads, run-down farms and 19th-century stone houses that typify much of Hunterdon County, there is an increasing intrusion more alarming than the deer or bears that wander into people's backyards: crime. While the crime rate is down sharply in most parts of New Jersey, it is rising in Hunterdon County -- and faster than anywhere else in the state, according to statistics released last week for the first half of 1998. The statistics, compiled by the state police, showed Hunterdon with a 32 percent increase, almost entirely due to nonviolent crimes like burglary and car theft.

VIf he could take control of the millions of dollars Mexico spends each year to combat drug trafficking, Miguel Gonzalez Espinosa would spend a little less of it on high-tech, heavily armed operations at airports and along the border, aimed at stopping the flow of drugs from Colombia on their way to the United States. Mr. Gonzalez, who proudly calls himself a recovering alcoholic, directs a small drug rehabilitation center in the downtrodden neighborhood that surrounds the city's Basilica de Guadalupe. He sees firsthand the toll taken by a less-talked-about, but increasingly damaging problem: the rise in drug abuse -- especially cocaine and crack -- among Mexican youth.

''We are going to have businesses coming here from out of state and setting up major operations,'' said Ray Powers, the Republican president of the State Senate in Colorado, where eight initiatives were on the ballot in November. ''Now if you have $400,000, you can get your issue on the ballot with paid circulators and into law with 30-second sound bites. That's not a true citizens' initiative.''

VAs a 10-year-old glued to the TV through the summer of Watergate, I remember the air of gravity that hung over the proceedings, the sense that it was a dreadful necessity to put a President on trial. I don't recall authority figures having to explain that it was a national crisis -- even to a kid, that was pretty obvious. One of the oddest things about the impeachment weekend just before Christmas was the constant stream of reminders that the country was again experiencing such a crisis. Throughout the ordeal, legislators and commentators tried to come up with more dramatic ways to frame the events taking place. Bill Clinton was about to become only the second President ever impeached. He would be our first elected President ever impeached. All through the holidays and on into January the tone remained the same: we were having the first Senate trial of a President in 130 years. Watching TV was like having someone grab you by the lapels and shout, Don't you understand this is supposed to be historic! Bill Clinton's impeachment is historic in the sense of it being an event historians will puzzle over in decades to come. But what those historians will have to ponder is not how it shook the country, but why it didn't. They will have to explain how the country experienced the form of a constitutional crisis without the content of one, how an impeachment could drive a President's approval rating up instead of down. They may be better disposed than contemporary observers of the Clinton scandal to look beyond the Dow Jones industrial average for an explanation. For Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal represents something that is truly historic -- a break in the way the American Presidency functions.

VRobbie Bishop, a 35-year-old police captain with a small-town force in Villa Rica, Ga., had developed a reputation around the South as a cop with a sixth sense for sniffing out drugs during routine traffic stops. In some innate, almost inexplicable way, associates said, he could detect secret compartments in cars and could tell when a truck was riding just a little too low. During a decade-long career, Captain Bishop confiscated thousands of pounds of drugs and millions of dollars in cash, and was enlisted by police departments around the country to train their officers. But that career came to an end on Wednesday apparently in one of those seemingly routine traffic stops on Interstate 20 in Carroll County, west of Atlanta, when Captain Bishop was killed by a gunshot to the head.

VDark, rich and lusciously sweet, chocolate is the most irresistible of confections, so addictive that it has been suspected of intoxicating with marijuana-like opiates and chemicals that can mimic the brain chemistry of a person in love. Chocolate seems to have a special power over women, who consistently rate it as their No. 1 food craving and whose desire for it often intensifies around the time of menstruation. As a result, scientists have hypothesized that a woman's need to order a triple chocolate cake or to make a midnight run for fudge brownie ice cream may not be mere indulgence, but instead her body's attempt to satisfy a natural need for the powerful chemistry of chocolate.

VWHEN New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced a tough new plan this month to seize the vehicles of drunk drivers, he might have had a talk first with Dick Weart. A decade ago, Mr. Weart was the ombudsman for the Federal Government's zero-tolerance drug crackdown. From his desk in Washington, he fielded frantic telephone calls from customs inspectors all over the country who had just turned up a few marijuana seeds or the end of a marijuana cigarette in a car or boat.

Major crime is at a record low in the city, but judges, lawyers and court administrators say the crush of lesser offenses is delaying trials, leading to an increase in dismissed cases and requiring witnesses and defendants to return to court repeatedly to resolve minor cases.

VDRIVERS on drugs are involved in thousands of fatal accidents on American roads each year, according to Federal statistics. Most attention is focused on illicit drugs like marijuana and cocaine, for which any use is considered abuse. But new research in Britain shows that in many accidents, the drugs involved are perfectly legal. The study, by researchers at the University of Dundee in Scotland, examined nearly 20,000 crashes from August 1992 to June 1995. Cross-checking the drivers against prescription records, the researchers found a very strong link between crashes and the use of tranquilizers.

VSouthold Town police are concluding an internal investigation that so far has found no basis for charges that a white police officer beat and threatened to kill a black Greenport resident during an arrest in December. The police chief, Joseph Conway, ordered the investigation after John Mimms of Greenport, who is black, filed a complaint that also accused Officer Stephen Zuhoski, the officer Mr. Mimms identified as his assailant, of using racial epithets during the beating.

VTURBO-CAPITALISM Winners and Losers in the Global Economy By Edward Luttwak 290 pages. HarperCollins. $26. By the term turbo-capitalism, Edward Luttwak means turbocharged capitalism, or the state of today's American economy, which has been ''unleashed by the abolition of anti-competition laws and regulations left over from the 1930's, by the technological innovations thus allowed, by the privatization of whatever could be privatized, and by the removal of most import barriers.''

VThe death of a Dominican man last month at a detention center in lower Manhattan has prompted advocates for immigrants to raise questions once again about the conditions in which immigrants are held in the New York region and elsewhere in the country. After a month of tests, the authorities revealed last week that Miguel A. Valoy-Nunez, a seemingly healthy 40-year-old awaiting deportation, died of pneumonia and a viral infection two days after he first complained of chest pain and a consistent cough. Nurses at the immigration detention center on Varick Street treated him as if he had a cold and he was never checked by a doctor, Federal health officials have said.

VThe second of two young men accused of torturing and killing a popular Bronx public high school English teacher took the witness stand in his own defense yesterday and accused the police of tricking him into making a false confession by questioning him while he was drunk. The defendant, Montoun T. Hart, 27, testified that he was never in the apartment of the slain teacher, Jonathan M. Levin, and played no role in the slaying. In November, his co-defendant, Corey Arthur, a former student of Mr. Levin's, was convicted of second-degree murder.

VA Manhattan jury acquitted a 27-year-old Brooklyn man yesterday of all charges in the May 1997 torture and slaying of a popular Bronx public high school teacher. The jurors criticized the aggressive police tactics used in the case, saying they could not trust a confession made by the defendant, Montoun T. Hart, because detectives questioned him when he was drunk and high on marijuana. An ebullient Mr. Hart, who said he had been threatened with a death sentence and pressured into falsely confessing, jumped up and down and hugged his lawyer as the jury forewoman pronounced him not guilty of second-degree murder and robbery in the death of the teacher, Jonathan M. Levin, 31.

VA former deputy sheriff who once ran for sheriff faces up to 40 years in prison after pleading guilty to hauling a truckload of marijuana across the country. The former deputy sheriff, Ronald Saunders, 41, pleaded guilty on Thursday to a Federal felony drug conspiracy charge for the trip two summers ago, The Post-Star of Glens Falls reported. Under Federal guidelines, the sentence will most likely include three or four years in prison and a period of supervised release, officials said.

VOriginally, prosecutors appeared to have a strong case against Montoun T. Hart, a 27-year-old Brooklyn man accused of participating in the murder of a popular Bronx high school teacher. Mr. Hart had given the police an 11-page confession of his role in the slaying of the teacher, Jonathan M. Levin, citing details that detectives said only someone present at the killing would know. And prosecutors had eyewitness testimony that put Mr. Hart at an automated teller machine near the victim's apartment at the same time that records show Mr. Levin's A.T.M. card was used there.

VMontoun T Hart, accused of participating in murder of teacher Jonathan M Levin in Manhattan, was acquitted of all charges despite seemingly strong case by prosecution, including Hart's signed confession; jurors say so many questions were raised about how confession was obtained that they decided it was too unreliable and threw it out; legal experts say that because Hart's confession was not recorded, it would never be known whether it was genuine or coerced; confessions are sometimes videotaped in New York, but in this case detectives chose not to videotape Hart; photos (M)

VEven when he is a shade queasy, Steven Spielberg has no trouble with self-reflection. He has the bearing of a man who has come in for his annual physical knowing he's in good shape. He is queasy just now only because his jet is taking off, bound for New York from Los Angeles, and Spielberg is rather afraid of flying. So, cradling a mug of cinnamon-stick tea, he concentrates on the question at hand -- a question concerning the nature of his character -- and responds by cheerfully reciting the moral code he learned long ago: ''A Boy Scout,'' he says, ''is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.'' And how does Spielberg measure up today?

VONE day in the late 1970's, Bowie Kuhn, then the commissioner of baseball, invited Marvin Miller, then the executive director of the Major League Players Association, to lunch for the first and only time. At one point Kuhn said to Miller, his adversary of more than 10 years: ''Look, Marvin, you've beaten the owners at every turn. And now the owners need a victory.'' Miller, as he recently recalled, couldn't believe his ears. ''Bowie,'' asked Miller, ''are you suggesting I throw the game?''

He ate sparingly and avoided sweets and grease. He took such good care of his teeth that they looked fake. My father had terrible habits. He was chronically angry. He threw things around the house and broke them. He didn't drink often, but when he did, he turned more violent than usual. He didn't go to doctors, even when we begged him to. He let a big, ugly mole on his back grow bigger and bigger, and so he died of malignant melanoma, a curable cancer, at 51.

VTHEY were young, still in their 20's, when they began trying to conceive a child. When it did not happen, the New York couple decided just to keep trying, to give nature time to take its course. But nature did not oblige. When four years had passed without a pregnancy, they consulted a doctor, who quickly identified the problem: semen analysis showed that the husband had very few sperm.

VThe front-line role of the Customs Service in the Government's war against illegal drugs has left the agency highly vulnerable to narcotics-related corruption, Customs officials acknowledged today in a report to Congress. The report, which was sent to a House panel with jurisdiction over the agency, admitted that the service had failed to combat corruption aggressively. In an atmosphere of neglect, internal affairs inquiries languished and were sometimes impeded because of infighting, it said.

VA week after a Brooklyn man was acquitted of all charges in the slaying of her son, Carol Levin said yesterday that a Manhattan jury was wrong to free the man, Montoun T. Hart, and that she has concluded that Mr. Hart participated in the torture and killing of her son, Jonathan M. Levin. Speaking in her first interview since Mr. Hart's acquittal last Thursday, Ms. Levin told a small group of reporters yesterday that Mr. Hart's testimony that he played no role in the killing initially ''turned my life upside down,'' but now, she said, she believes a confession he made earlier.

VJASON WILLIAMS, the rookie point guard from the University of Florida currently distributing flair in Sacramento, is lucky. He does not have to be like Mike. Instead of needing the Dean Smith stamp of approval and a clean collegiate image, he can merely prove himself as a player and not worry about his sketchy past. Instead of trying to measure up to Michael Jordan, whose presence in the National Basketball Association grew larger than legend, he can find a kindred spirit in someone like, well, Jayson Williams -- the Nets center who went from being a young knucklehead to a hard-working veteran.

VThere was no news at 772 St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem yesterday, nothing to report but the residents' grief, anger, despair and solemn prayers for Thelma Keets, an 82-year-old widow who had lived quietly on the top floor of the six-story building for 42 years, until someone knocked at her door on Saturday. It was someone she knew, the police and her neighbors said, a teen-ager for whom she had baby-sat years ago, and had continued to befriend despite his troubles with drugs and the law. She let him in, they said, and he attacked her ferociously with a knife, apparently for a few dollars to buy marijuana.

VThe board that oversees international drug-control treaties for the United Nations has recommended that governments sponsor impartial research into the medicinal benefits of marijuana, which some users say alleviates the pain and nausea associated with AIDS, cancer and other diseases. But the International Narcotics Control Board stressed that such research must not become a pretext for legalizing cannabis, as marijuana is called in many parts of the world. If the drug is determined to have medicinal value, the board said, its use should be subjected to the same stringent controls applied to cocaine and morphine, the opiate from which heroin is derived.

The ministers decided the complaint failed to show Mr. Ziegler had endangered Swiss security. Elizabeth Olson (NYT) TURKEY: LAWYERS TO SEE OCALAN -- Lawyers defending the Kurdish rebel chief Abdullah Ocalan have been given permission to visit him for the first time since he was seized by Turkish commandos on Feb. 16 in Kenya.

VA 66-year-old man accused of selling crack inside his retirement home was among 21 people arrested Friday night in a Staten Island drug sweep, the police said. All of those arrested were members or associates of local Bloods gangs, they said. ''We believe that one-third of them are Bloods and the rest are associates,'' said Capt. Paul Murtha, commanding officer of the Staten Island narcotics unit. He said that the two Bloods sects under investigation were getting almost $10,000 a week selling drugs.

VIn the first public debate over the Police Department's 16-month-old practice of using video surveillance in and around Washington Square Park, residents and merchants credited the cameras with chasing away drug dealers and restoring an air of safety. But some civil libertarians and park users at last week's hearing, which was sponsored by Community Board 2, said the high-powered lenses invade privacy. Carl Rosenstein, a SoHo resident who led a petition drive against the cameras, argued that citizens should have ''the freedom to assemble without surveillance.''

VYears ago, travelers to Jamaica rhapsodized about its azure seas and friendly people. Errol Flynn, one of the many celebrity types who once frequented the place (Noel Coward and Ian Fleming were others), said it was where the folks who wrote the Bible ''got their descriptions of Paradise.'' Now, anyone headed to Jamaica gets a warning -- about the crime, the drugs, the unceasing hassles and hustles. But there are at least two ways to avoid all of that and to enjoy the island's enduring beauty and neighborliness: One is to get away from it all and the other is to get above it all.

VLate on a chilly October night three years ago, Larry Harper told his family that life was no longer worth living and headed out the door with a handgun. He had slipped back to using crack cocaine after being in drug treatment and was ashamed to face his wife and brother. The family called the Albuquerque police for help. In response, a paramilitary unit, nine men clad in camouflage and armed with automatic rifles and stun grenades, stormed into the park where Mr. Harper had gone in despair.

Williams, in which he suggested that certain minority groups were disproportionately responsible for some kinds of drug trafficking, were wrong. But in an interview -- one of a series that her aides arranged today with reporters in the capital -- she reiterated her contention that there was no widespread practice of ''racial profiling'' by state troopers.

VWhen American troops helped destroy more than one million marijuana plants in December in the rugged northern regions of this island, growers were outraged. They protested on radio and in front of Government offices. They appealed to business and political leaders. They even started a petition drive to ask President Clinton for damages. ''The Americans are not showing any real concern for our economic and social development,'' said Junior Cottle, chairman of a group of marijuana growers who described himself as ''representative of the ganja man.''

People searching for a discussion of Amnesty International's views on Tunisia learned about human rights in that North African country -- but from supporters of the Tunisian authorities, not from the human rights group. The government supporters brought surfers to a site with a soothing Web address: www.amnesty-tunisia.org.

VSlam It's fitting that the verbal competitions called slams -- head-to-head clashes of rap, performance art and stand-up comedy -- have their own movie to do for this rhythmically charged, fervently incantatory street poetry what ''Saturday Night Fever'' did for disco in the 70's. Ray Joshua (Saul Williams, above) makes a charismatic young black inner city hero. Around the housing project known as Dodge City, Ray's mild-mannered intelligence makes him something of a mythic being, but that doesn't keep him out of prison for possession of marijuana. Behind bars he writes poetry, develops his delivery to mesmerizing effect and meets a young woman (Sonja Sohn), a slammer herself, who teaches a writing class. Later on the outside she invites Ray on stage, where he ''kills'' (slamese for knocks them dead). This may be rose-colored, but ''what 'Slam' possesses,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ''is a real passion, and that is in short supply in movies these days."

VGuy Ritchie's brash, ebullient direction of his first feature, ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' makes it very obvious that he honed his style making music videos and commercials. And for once that doesn't hurt. The punchy little flourishes that load this English gangster film with attitude are perfectly welcome, because there's no honest, substantial part of the movie they can hurt. Mr. Ritchie is skillful enough to make a fine feat of macho gamesmanship out of the way four sets of East End crooks keep outsmarting one another. And if that means having them all arm for battle while the ''Zorba the Greek'' theme music heightens the intensity of the moment, well, why not? Touches like that, along with flashy, random shifts of film speed and a true rogues' gallery of striking if one-note characters, do hold interest even if they have no real right to. The commercial aspects also deflect attention from the fact that this story has almost no center at all. The closest it comes to heroes are the four savvy young con men whom the film introduces first. Mr. Ritchie brings on Eddie (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemying), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) as if they were the ''Trainspotting'' crew, but the story soon begins to lose them in the shuffle. Thick accents, desaturated brownish color and 20-odd actors with comparably important roles don't do much to alleviate this mild confusion.

VPolice departments in a wide variety of communities nationwide have been accused of routinely using racial stereotypes as a tool with which to target people for suspicion of involvement in crime. With that controversy as a backdrop, and accusations that the New Jersey State Police in particular had unfairly singled out black drivers to be stopped on state highways, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman swiftly dismissed the head of the State Police after he was quoted as saying it was naive to think race was not an issue in drug crimes.

The lawyers, who accused the police of trying to ''dirty up'' Mr. Diallo's background, said they were calling on local and Federal law enforcement officials to broaden their investigations into the death of Mr. Diallo, who died in a barrage of 41 bullets fired by the four officers on Feb. 4.

VA two-year-old Federal investigation into allegations of racial discrimination by the New Jersey State Police proceeded slowly in its early stages because the police lagged in forwarding requested information to Washington, a top Justice Department official told a group of New Jersey lawmakers and black ministers today. The Justice Department acknowledged last month that it had been conducting a civil rights investigation since 1996 into charges that New Jersey state troopers routinely stopped black and Hispanic drivers on state highways solely because of their skin color, a tactic commonly known as racial profiling.

VMAJOR JAN ZEMAN was a Czech Communist Columbo, Peter Falk in immaculately pressed fatigues, a savvy television cop whose tough questions and dogged detective work unraveled the greatest mysteries of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and always got the party's man. From 1970 to the mid-1980's, ''The 30 Cases of Major Zeman'' was one of Czechoslovakia's greatest television hits, avidly followed by party members and counter-revolutionaries alike. The premise was simple. Introduced in honor of the 30th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's Communist police force, the show took its plots from celebrated crimes, each reworked to turn party members into heroes and the capitalists, kulaks (well-to-do farmers who profited from the work of poorer peasants) and hippies into enemies of socialism.

VONE of the dangers with interviewing Sean Kelly is that you might find out what your name means, if it happens to be Irish. (From the Gaelic, Kelly translates as something like ''sacred prostitute.'' Kennedy means ''ugly head.'') You will also probably hear more than you want about the Irish saint whose day this is: first of all, he was not Irish but Welsh-Italian; his given name was not Patrick, it was Succat; he was not even the first Christian missionary to visit Ireland.

VThe authorities say they arrested the ring leader yesterday of a suburban drug operation that netted $1.2 million a year, along with 36 suppliers and dealers in New Jersey, Virginia and Philadelphia. The ring, described by investigators as among the largest in the region, primarily sold marijuana, as well as hashish and psychedelic mushrooms to suburban residents and high school students, Camden County Prosecutor Lee A. Solomon said. He said that James B. Lugiano, 33, of Cherry Hill, bought the drugs from three suppliers in Philadelphia. The drugs were then distributed to dealers in Burlington and Camden Counties and parts of northern Virginia, he said. More than 100 law enforcement officers from nearly two dozen agencies fanned out Wednesday, searching nine locations. They seized 45 pounds of marijuana with a street value of $135,000, three pounds of mushrooms, $17,000 in cash, four weapons and 12 vehicles.

VThe active ingredients in marijuana appear to be useful for treating pain, nausea and the severe weight loss associated with AIDS, according to a new study commissioned by the Government that is inflaming the contentious debate over whether doctors should be permitted to prescribe the drug. The report, the most comprehensive analysis to date of the medical literature about marijuana, said there was no evidence that giving the drug to sick people would increase illicit use in the general population. Nor is marijuana a ''gateway drug'' that prompts patients to use harder drugs like cocaine and heroin, the study said.

VTwenty-five black and Hispanic criminal defendants are in legal limbo after the New Jersey Attorney General's office postponed their prosecutions because all were arrested or stopped by two troopers involved in a controversial shooting on the New Jersey Turnpike last April. Their defense lawyers have said that the unusual legal step has denied their clients' rights to speedy trials and stalled court challenges to the arrests. In addition, the suspended cases have prevented two defense lawyers from getting documents they want to examine for evidence that the state police singled out black and Hispanic motorists in their search for drug traffickers.

VThe long-awaited Government-commissioned report on marijuana that was issued on Wednesday may have concerned the drug's medicinal uses, but it has also opened a debate on marijuana's longstanding role as linchpin of a national policy of zero tolerance toward illicit drugs. In addressing issues like whether marijuana was a gateway to the use of harder drugs (the researchers found no convincing evidence that it was), the report used language calculated not to overstep the bounds of scientific inquiry into the arena of political argument.

VEvery weekday morning around 11 o'clock, a middle-aged stockbroker named Irvin Rosenfeld gets up from his desk and walks to a breezeway outside his office in Boca Raton, Fla. There, alongside the potted palms and smokers taking their breaks, he lights up a cigarette of his own -- not tobacco, but marijuana, sent to him by the Federal Government. The arrangement is 16 years old and perfectly legal. Mr. Rosenfeld, who suffers from a rare bone disorder and smokes to relieve his pain, is part of an exclusive club of Americans who receive a free can of marijuana cigarettes each month under a ''compassionate use'' program sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

VIT could have been Germany in the 1940's, but it is Sierra Leone today. Soldiers arrive at the door searching for people to conscript or shoot. Upstairs people silently huddle together, hearts racing. This is the Sierra Leone that the Rev. John Thompson knows. He was sent there by the Salesian Provincial House in New Rochelle, where he is based. Born and raised in the Panama Canal Zone (his father was American, his mother had British citizenship) Father Thompson came to the United States in 1965 and did his seminary work in Goshen in Orange County. He studied philosophy and was ordained as a Salesian priest in the Roman Catholic Church in 1979.

VIt has been smoked for centuries, lionized in poetry and song (''Everybody must get stoned!''), vilified in film (''Reefer Madness''). Now marijuana, which can bring both euphoria and a Federal prison term, has secured its place in the medical literature, with a comprehensive Government-financed report that finds its active components help patients with pain, nausea and the severe weight loss associated with AIDS. The report, conducted by an independent panel of experts at the Institute of Medicine, set off much hullabaloo when it was released. Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, who commissioned the study as director of the National Office on Drug Control Policy, trumpeted its conclusion: there is ''little future in smoked marijuana.'' Proponents of legalizing the drug for medical use seized upon the report as evidence that ''therapeutic cannabis'' is not a contradiction in terms.

VA Government-commissioned panel of experts reported last week that there had been ''an explosion of new scientific knowledge'' on the medical uses of marijuana. The chemicals in marijuana, they concluded, can fight the nausea induced by chemotherapy, boost the appetites of AIDS patients and ameliorate some symptoms of multiple sclerosis. The report was no news to me. I had reached the same conclusions as a cancer patient, seven years ago. In 1992 I was found to have testicular cancer. My chemotherapy put me in the hospital for five days at a time, once a month, for four months. But midway through my treatment I could tell that Zofran, then a hot new drug prescribed to combat nausea, was losing its effect. For the remainder of my chemotherapy I turned to marijuana to keep my head out of the toilet.

VHeroin use in New York City remains high, with more young people trying heroin and more users now snorting the drug than injecting it, often under the misconception that snorting will not lead to addiction, according to a new report on drug trends released yesterday. Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House's director of national drug control policy, visited St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center on Manhattan's West Side to release his office's latest Pulse Check, a semiannual report on national trends in drug abuse gathered from 200 treatment centers and law enforcement officials in 16 cities, including New York.

VJason Perry is a 17-year-old Brooklyn high school student who takes it for granted that he will be hassled by the police if he goes out after dark in his Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. He estimates that in the past year, he has been stopped, frisked and interrogated at least 10 times. Once, he said, he was issued a summons for not carrying an identification card. ''They see a black boy walking down the street and of course they're going to stop you,'' he said.

VDennis Carlson sold his first wheat, grown on a field borrowed from his parents, in 1975, when he was 14 years old. He earned $4.51 a bushel and resolved to follow his father, grandfather and great-grandfather into farming. Nearly 24 years later, spring wheat is selling for $2.91 a bushel, and Mr. Carlson worries whether he can afford to plant in April. ''We're going to get a low price,'' he said. ''And if we get a bumper crop, it's going to get lower.''

VWheat farmers in North Dakota and elsewhere, battered by sinking commodity prices and rising costs, are lobbying state legislatures to legalize cultivation of hemp, which is grown in other countries for its fiber and seed oil but banned in US as part of war on drugs because of long identification with marijuana; are opposed by Federal officials unwilling to relax drug laws even symbolically by approving once-common American crop; White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, which until recently opposed legalizing hemp on grounds action would send wrong message, indicates position may be softening; comments by director Gen Barry R McCaffrey noted; photos (M)

VFEAR of crime and resentment against immigrants are perennial themes of American politics, and Congress touched both when it revised American policy toward legal residents in the mid-1990's. Non-citizens, even permanent residents, were made subject to deportation for a wide range of crimes that had previously been considered too minor. There was, at least according to immigration officials, no flexibility in deciding whom to deport. The Draconian nature of the change brought immediate cries from civil libertarians and advocates for immigrants, but so far court challenges have had little effect.

VALOT of people are pulling for Allen Iverson to make it. The women who kept a vigil in a Virginia courtroom during his 1993 trial. The former Governor of Virginia who granted Iverson clemency after he served four months in prison. The university and the coach who accepted Iverson when other schools backed away. Even a growing number of bored-to-tears members of the news media who feel that the National Basketball Association should drop its Victorian pretenses and embrace Iverson as the league's new marquee player. Problem is, everyone seems to see Iverson's future except Iverson, who appears trapped in an invisible cage that keeps him pointed to his past.

VMajor League Soccer banned anabolic steroids and human growth hormone yesterday and expects to begin testing players by next season, when scientific tests are expected to be more reliable. Commissioner Doug Logan said the league added six categories to its list of banned substances, including erythropoietin (EPO), an endurance-boosting hormone that increases the blood's ability to carry oxygen and was at the center of the Tour de France drug scandal last year.

The new survey, by Pride, an organization based in Atlanta that counsels schools and parents on ways to inhibit drug use among the young, also confirms again what many researchers have long known: that cigarettes, alcohol (primarily beer) and inhalants are used far more by children than are marijuana or harder drugs.

VOn Eighth Avenue, during afternoon rush hour, they stride four abreast in traffic lanes as if marching in a parade, then cross en masse on the diagonal, mid-block, to stream into the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Jaywalkers, declared an endangered species in January 1998 as part of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's quality of life campaign, seem to be thriving. On the Avenue of the Americas at 50th Street, home of the infamous pedestrian barricades, a police officer stationed at the corner one afternoon this week simply advised people crossing outside the crosswalk to be careful.

VKhalid El-Amin, the star point guard who helped lead the University of Connecticut to the national basketball championship, was charged with possessing marijuana tonight after the police here had stopped him on suspicion of running a red light. Richard Hamilton, the team's all-America swingman, was riding in the red Cadillac driven by El-Amin but faces no charges, the police said. Lieut. Michael A. Manzi said El-Amin had a ''nickel bag'' of marijuana -- a plastic bag containing $5 worth of the drug. The police said that he had ''a very minor amount,'' less than an ounce. Connecticut officials say that possession of less than four ounces is a misdemeanor, and that was the charge against El-Amin.

VMary Jane Rathbun, who became known as the grandmotherly Brownie Mary who handed out brownies laced with high-grade marijuana to sick people to relieve their pain and nausea, died on Saturday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 77 and lived in San Francisco. Ms. Rathbun campaigned on the local, state and national level to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes. She baked the brownies in the small kitchen of her home in a housing project for the elderly in the largely gay Castro neighborhood of San Francisco. She called them ''original recipe brownies'' and ''magically delicious.'' In one raid on her home in 1981, the police confiscated 54 dozen of them, along with more than 18 pounds of the marijuana, donated by growers.

VA WHIFF of incense mixed with marijuana smoke drifts through two recent movies, ''Hideous Kinky'' and ''A Walk on the Moon,'' both of which conjure an era that Hollywood, in its devotion to snugly happy endings, has largely avoided. In the countercultural dream that has so intimidated Hollywood, a hippie Pied Piper with stringy shoulder-length hair, a fringed jacket and reeking of patchouli oil is banging a tambourine on his knee with one hand and flashing a peace sign with the other. Beside him are a trio of spaced-out go-go girls shimmying and gazing groggily into the purple haze. Although that signature scent, blown across three decades of shifting winds, isn't overpowering in these films, it is just pungent enough to suggest that what we think of as ''the 60's'' -- the years (1964-72) bracketed musically by Beatlemania and ''American Pie'' -- were not a hallucination but a messy, uncomfortable reality. In their hesitantly nostalgic ways, both films remind us that in the days of turning on, tuning in and dropping out, people actually followed Timothy Leary's notorious prescription for personal enlightenment.

VMore than 200,000 faithful fans took to the chilly streets here today for a parade saluting the University of Connecticut men's basketball team, which won this year's national championship after years of late-season heartbreaks. The UConn players donned T-shirts declaring ''Mission Accomplished'' for the team's victory lap through the Connecticut capital on a flatbed towed by a tractor-trailer, which drove slowly enough for the state's heroes to dispense autographs and low-fives. Three eighth-grade girls from Bristol vied for blown kisses by wearing UConn Husky boxer shorts and a basketball net on their heads.

VUndercover police officers arrested 14 people on drug charges early yesterday at a Chelsea nightclub owned by Peter Gatien, the nightclub magnate who pleaded guilty to tax evasion this year after repeated legal battles with the Giuliani administration. After a buy-and-bust operation, officers discovered bags of cocaine and marijuana, an Ecstasy pill and three bottles of Ketamine, an inhalant, on the floor of the nightclub, the Tunnel, where they said that Ecstasy was being sold, said Officer Chris Cottingham, a Police Department spokesman. A patron of the club suffered a drug overdose during the sting and was taken to a hospital, where he was in stable condition yesterday, the authorities said.

VAbout 12 hours before the National Football League draft, Leigh Steinberg, the agent for Oregon quarterback Akili Smith, had reached a tentative deal with the Cleveland Browns, owners of the first pick. Steinberg is one of the most skilled negotiators in the business, and, being a draft-day veteran, he can smell a setup. Something just did not feel right. So Steinberg went to the Browns and pleaded with them: draft Kentucky's Tim Couch if you want, but don't use Smith to make Couch more signable. The Browns said they would not.

VJust in the first half of the Monday night show at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, there were three old men in Neil Young's lyrics, standing there as symbols of ancient knowledge and the mystery of time. But oldness settled into his set in another way, too: though Mr. Young sang and played in top form and though he is only 53, the show had a strangely geriatric level of energy. Years of nearly constant touring have made Mr. Young grow into the songs he performed about long-term love (''Harvest Moon''), the environment (''After the Gold Rush'') and the delicious loneliness of the road (''Albuquerque''); there's a kind of fusion between animate and inanimate there, in the way that a fence, positioned for years against a great tree, eventually becomes enfolded by it. His artfully sketchy guitar technique radiates crotchety personality: his heavy thumb made low strings twinge and rattle, and he played in and around the chords with his free-ranging strumming, pecking an extra note or savoring the friction of the clashing tones from two strings. And his clear but inward singing demonstrated all the solitary emotion in his songs.

VArizona, the first state to begin treating all its nonviolent drug offenders rather than locking them up, says its new policy of diverting addicts from prison into treatment has already saved the taxpayers money. A report issued yesterday by the Arizona Supreme Court estimated that the state's new program saved more than $2.5 million in its first fiscal year of operation, which ended in June 1998, and looks likely to reap greater savings in the future. The report determined the savings by calculating the difference in cost between locking up a prisoner and putting the prisoner on probation and in treatment.

VParents who talk to children about the risks of illicit drugs sometimes despair that their warning goes in one ear and out the other. But the message just might stick in a young brain if it is repeated enough, according to a study of parental and adolescent attitudes released today. The study by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, a nonprofit coalition, also reported a dramatic disconnection between parents and children in getting the message through. The study is being released at www.drugfreeamerica.org.

VStudents with bellies and backpacks full of beer were just beginning to clump in merry groups of a dozen or so on a parking lot at the University of Connecticut a little after 11 Saturday night when -- fwoom! -- a bonfire stoked by junk mail, shrubs and pizza boxes lighted up the chilly finale to spring weekend. This was the moment that had brought 100 state troopers to campus, determined to prevent a riot like the one that closed last year's UConn spring weekend, when students set a Honda Accord on fire, flipped five other cars over and even tried to light the alcohol-based pepper spray used by police officers who were being pelted with bottles, rocks and golf balls.

VIf timing is everything, then the recent carnage at Columbine High School indicates that now could scarcely be less opportune for the opening of ''Idle Hands,'' a cheap-thrills horror film built around a teen-age murder rampage that reaches its climax among panic-stricken students at a Halloween dance in a small-town high school. Even pretensions toward the humorous and hip cannot save this blood-drenched film from its innate tastelessness, calculated to find its audience among those, like its hero and his friends, whose vapid lives are a celebration of truancy, marijuana and junk food in a virtually parentless habitat that stretches only from bed to television set.

VA homeless man accused of pushing a commuter into the path of an oncoming subway train on Wednesday had a history of mental illness and told detectives that he had spent the day of the attack roaming city streets, convinced people were trying to kill him, a police official said yesterday. But investigators said that they had found no evidence that the man, Julio Perez, 43, had committed any acts of serious violence before pushing Edgar Rivera, 46, onto the tracks. The train severed Mr. Rivera's legs, but he survived the attack and was in critical but stable condition yesterday at Bellevue Hospital Center, said Lorinda Klein, a hospital spokeswoman.

VThe Interior Ministry is a gray institution, a well-worn, humdrum place of civil servants, paper piles and rubber stamps. But this week it grabbed the Israeli public by the lapels in a way that nothing has thus far in a personality-based campaign for the election on May 17. In catchy, hard-hitting television commercials, the Russian immigrant party led by Natan Sharansky demanded that it be given control of the Interior Ministry, long controlled by the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party.

VTHE stereotype persists through all forms of music and all forms of drug and alcohol abuse: jazz musicians get hooked on heroin. Rock stars freak out on LSD. All of them guzzle great quantities of wine and whisky. So goes the popular thinking about those who make music. Like most cliches, this one does have some unfortunate truth to it. But Dr. John Wallace, who is the director of substance abuse at St. Vincent's Hospital in Rye and himself a jazz pianist, has set out to prove that being a musician does not automatically consign one to a life of drinking and illegal drug use.

VA big fat dose of spring was reported to have arrived in earnest throughout New York City yesterday. And just about everywhere you looked, the evidence was rather compelling. In Times Square at 8 A.M., there was Cindy Crawford, warming up packs of numbered runners for a jog to Central Park to raise money for women's health issues. Not long after, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani went bowling in Bryant Park to kick off a pro bowling tournament and raise awareness of himself. And in neighborhoods across the rest of the city, New Yorkers kicked off the first real spring weekend this year under a gorgeous, cloudless blue sky.

VEight months ago, Chris Antley was a broken-down jockey. His weight had ballooned to 147 pounds, or at least that was the number he saw when he had the guts to look at the scale. He had returned home to Columbia, S.C., to live with his folks. He was lost, and his father, Les, tried to buck him up. ''My dad told me to start another business,'' said the jockey who led the nation in victories in 1985 and was the Kentucky Derby winner in 1991 aboard Strike the Gold. ''He told me, 'You don't need to ride.' He was trying to persuade me to ease up.''

VAs he stepped from a black stretch limousine in front of a modest Milwaukee house in January, Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, knew a lot was riding on the interview he was about to conduct. Just how much, it would later turn out, he couldn't fully understand. Joined by Ernie Grunfeld, then the Knicks' president, their coach, Jeff Van Gundy, and another team executive, Checketts was there to gauge the character of Latrell Sprewell. A three-time All-Star guard, Sprewell had been on furlough ever since attacking his coach with the Golden State Warriors, P. J. Carlesimo, the year before, choking him, threatening to kill him and, 20 minutes later, returning to the gym to punch him. Both Grunfeld and Van Gundy wanted Sprewell badly, but if Checketts was going to gamble on the National Basketball Association's most prominent pariah, he needed to know more, and not just about Sprewell's celebrated assault but also about a strange 1994 incident in which one of Sprewell's pit bulls bit off the ear of his 4-year-old daughter. Sprewell had refused to put the dog to sleep until the 10th and final day of its quarantine and, when questioned by reporters, had airily dismissed the episode, saying, ''Stuff happens.''

VTo Tony Bennett and his son Danny, it seemed just an offhand comment. At a star-studded Christmas Eve dinner party in 1997 at the home of Tommy Mottola, then the president of Sony Music Entertainment, Robert DeNiro turned to the crooner, who was 70 at the time, and said, ''Hey, Tony -- there's a film I want you in.'' Danny Bennett, 45, who is his father's manager, said: ''A lot of people say that kind of stuff. I didn't pay much attention.'' But a year later, he received a call from Harold Ramis, director of ''Analyze This,'' a Warner Brothers comedy starring Mr. DeNiro as the leader of a crime family who seeks help from a psychotherapist. Mr. Ramis, he said, offered his father $15,000 to sing ''Got the World on a String'' in the movie's final scene.

VGov. George E. Pataki proposed a plan today to loosen the stringent Rockefeller-era drug laws, which critics say have caused New York's prison population to swell over the last two decades with drug offenders who have been subjected to tough mandatory sentences. But Mr. Pataki's aides indicated that he would agree to ease the drug laws, including giving people convicted of drug crimes the right to appeal harsh sentences, only if his Democratic rivals in the Legislature approved one of his main criminal-justice initiatives of the year, the elimination of parole. Democratic leaders in the Assembly said today that they would be open to considering both proposals.

VNew York Gov George E Pataki proposes plan to loosen stringent Rockefeller-era drug laws, which critics say have caused state's prison population to swell over last two decades with drug offenders who have been subjected to tough mandatory sentences; would ease drug laws, including giving people convicted of drug crimes right to appeal harsh sentences, only if Democratic rivals in Legislature approve one of his main criminal-justice initiatives, namely, elimination of parole; critics say plan falls far short of their main goal of abandoning current sentencing structure for drug crimes, along with restoration of discretion to trial judges in determining punishment for drug offenders; laws adopted in 1973 under Republican Gov Nelson Rockefeller call for some of toughest prison sentences in nation for drug offenses and have remained in place despite mounting criticisms and repeated attempts, mostly by Democrats, to overhaul them; critics say laws have clogged state's prison system with drug offenders, many nonviolent who may be better served in treatment programs or other cheaper alternatives to prison; 9,063 people were sent to state prison in 1998 alone for drug offenses, bringing total serving terms for nonviolent drug crimes to slightly more than 22,000, or roughly one-third of total state prison population of 70,000; photo (M)

VFor Heroin's New Users, a Long, Hard Fall; Couple's Addiction Reflects Lure of a Purer, More Potent Drug
p27986
ssVabstract
p27987
VDoctors and sociologists report that more urban blacks are turning their backs on heroin, but at the same time, use of heroin has increased among whites because its unprecedented purity allows users to obtain a high by inhaling, rather than injecting drug; high purity has made drug more potent, and thus more dangerous; purity has soared since Colombian traffickers muscled into New York market, undercutting longtime Asian suppliers with lower prices and purer heroin; study in American Journal of Public Health says between 1988 and 1995, heroin prices dropped by average of 50 percent in 19 major cities, including New York, encouraging more consumption; life of heroin users Paul and Kathy Schroeder, who gave up comfortable middle-class home in Wayne, NJ, and are living in homeless shelter in Harlem, discussed; photo (M)

VMark Tuinei, the former Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman who was found dead in his car last Thursday, died after taking heroin and a popular recreational drug known as ecstasy, authorities said yesterday. An autopsy by the Collin County medical examiner's office showed that Tuinei, who was on three Super Bowl teams before he retired from the Cowboys last year, had used, apparently for the first time, a small amount of heroin after extended use for at least two weeks of the drug ecstasy, which is related to amphetamines.

VChris Antley, riding afternoon and night at two tracks, once won nine races in a single day. In 1991, he guided Strike the Gold to victory in the Kentucky Derby. And he was a savvy enough player of the stock market that he turned the $6 million he had earned riding race horses into a fortune big enough to insure that he would not have to work again. But none of that mattered 17 months ago. Antley, 32, was back in an alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinic.

VIt's big, it's bad, it's ''Cleopatra!'' What else could anyone expect? Onscreen, Cleopatra's legend has always been about spectacle, not character. So ABC's expensive two-night mini-series includes chariots, warships, battle scenes on horseback, the Pyramids, the streets of Rome, and countless varieties of Egyptian headdresses. But this is a spectacle going nowhere except off the deep end. Shakespeare may have described Cleopatra's power best when he praised ''her infinite variety,'' but here her charms are finite. In fact, this version strains so hard to make her an overachieving modern woman that she might as well have a to-do list taped to her throne: 1. Be a sexpot. 2. Be a great mom and queen. 3. Hook up with some Roman guy and try to conquer the world. The last one, of course, is the killer.

The decision came two months after a Government-sponsored study found that marijuana's active ingredient seemed to be useful for some conditions. Article page A11.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-7 Clinton Pushes for Troops Along Kosovo Border The Clinton Administration announced that the United States would press its allies to move quickly to deploy what was described as a peacekeeping force of about 50,000 troops on the borders of Kosovo. A1 Yugoslavia insisted that it play a central role in negotiations within the United Nations to end the war and provide a political settlement to Kosovo. A7 Rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence claim to have killed a Russian captain in a battle with Serbian troops inside Kosovo, in a development that could complicate Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis. A7 NATO warplanes assigned to attack a military compound in northwestern Kosovo struck what Yugoslavia's official news agency described as a nearby prison, killing at least 19 inmates and guards. A7 Smallpox Elimination Delayed A World Health Organization panel in Geneva effectively decided to postpone eradicating the world's known remaining stocks of the smallpox virus until at least 2002. The recommendation reflected widespread agreement that more time is needed to study smallpox before it is irrevocably destroyed. A3 Indonesian Students Protest Students protested and demanded that former President Suharto be tried on charges of corruption as they marched on Parliament on the first anniversary of Mr. Suharto's resignation. The police fired warning shots and tear gas at 2,000 protesters in a scene reminiscent of the riots that drove Mr. Suharto from office after 30 years. A3 New Bombing Suspect The United States Government has taken another suspect into custody in the continuing investigation of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged in the bombings of two United States embassies in Africa last year. The suspect, Ihab M. Ali, was charged with perjury on Wednesday after he came to New York City. A4 Germany's Immigration Law Germany adopted an immigration law that will make it easier for many of the country's seven million residents of foreign origin to become citizens. The legislation will go into effect on Jan. 1. A3 World Briefing A4 NATIONAL A8-11, 14 House Democrats Seek Early Vote on Gun Bill House Democrats called for a gun-control vote within the next week, in a move to build on the momentum of the Senate's juvenile crime bill that includes firearms measures. A1 A handful of provisions in the Senate bill may do as much or more to curb the flow of illegal guns than the much debated measures that require child safety locks and background checks at gun shows. A10 Today's graduation at Columbine High School will be broadcast by CNN. The community finds itself struggling with the massacre and with how to reclaim its privacy. A8 Investigators are planning to labor through the summer to determine if any friends of the gunmen in the Columbine school shootings aided them or knew of the attack beforehand. A8 The youth who shot and wounded six students at a school in Conyers, Ga., sat in a juvenile detention center for a second day as investigators continued to search his family's home for clues to his motivation. A8 Fund-Raiser Pleads Guilty Yah Lin Trie, a Democratic fund-raiser and friend of President Clinton, pleaded guilty to two political fund-raising charges and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department's campaign finance inquiry. A1 A note the Justice Department has obtained from Mr. Trie's Little Rock office suggests he was aware of a bribery problem. A9 Ruling on Medical Marijuana The Administration announced that it would sell Government-grown marijuana to privately financed scientists for research into whether marijuana can help sick people. A11 Reduced Penalty Sought Lawyers for President Clinton asserted in court that he should pay no more than $33,737 in reimbursements to lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit against Mr. Clinton. The Jones lawyers want $500,000. A14 Genome Project on Schedule The publicly financed effort to decode the human genome is on track to meet its goal of finishing a draft of the genome in a year. A11 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Plea Deal Rejected In Police Brutality Case Prosecutors have refused a plea deal sought by the police officer charged with torturing Abner Louima, according to people close to the case. They said that the offer was made and rejected the day after a police sergeant testified that the officer, Justin A. Volpe, had boasted to him that he had committed the torture. A1 Clintons Eye New York Vacation Hillary Rodham Clinton is edging closer to running for the Senate from New York, and the Clintons' choice of summer vacation spot is once again affected by politics. The First Couple are exploring the recreational options across the Empire State. A1 Lucci Wins an Emmy Susan Lucci won the Daytime Emmy award for best actress. The hard-luck soap star, who had been nominated 18 times, was honored for her portrayal of Erica Kane on ''All My Children.'' B4 Religious Rights Violated A Westchester County school district violated its students' First Amendment rights to religious freedom by allowing schools to engage in religious-oriented activities, including the construction of a Hindu god's likeness and New Age prayer recitals at an Earth Day celebration, a Federal judge ruled. B1 Plan to Block Pay Fails A law withholding legislators' pay until a budget is passed is unconstitutional, a Brooklyn judge ruled. The ruling was a blow to an attempt to speed the state's notoriously lethargic budget process. B1 Study on Gambling A commission appointed by President Clinton and Congress is expected to recommend in June that state lotteries curtail advertising in economically distressed communities and contribute to research and treatment for problem gambling. A1 ARTS & IDEAS B9-16 SPORTS D1-10 OBITUARIES C16 BUSINESS DAY C1-16 Phone Company Takeover Olivetti S.p.A., the mid-sized Italian telephone company, grabbed control of the nation's largest phone company, Telecom Italia S.p.A., successfully concluding a bitter three-month corporate battle. C1 Vitamin Cartel Was Secret The chairman and the chief executive of Roche Holding A.G. pronounced themselves blameless for the vitamin cartel uncovered by the Justice Department, even though they have admitted that some senior executives were its ringleaders. C1 Contract Talks Resume T.W.A. and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers returned to the negotiating table. If the airline and the union are unable to agree to a contract by June 10, the union will be free to walk out. C1 Microsoft Prepares Rebuttal Microsoft deposed Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online, as part the company's preparations for the rebuttal phase of the antitrust trial against the software giant. C3 Fall in Stock Markets Stocks fell as investors shifted from large companies that gained the most in recent years to laggards, including small stocks and utilities. The Nasdaq slumped 22.09 points, to 2,520.14; the Dow declined 37.46 points, to 10,829.28, and the S. P. 500 slipped 8.54 points, to 1,330.29.

VWith his brief career as a central-city grocer coming to a close, Tremayne Franks displayed the uncommon charms that have won him local renown. He cursed. He pouted. He sucked a grape lollipop. He proposed to women three times his age. He followed his boss around the store mocking his accented English; ''MAH-ka-shay! MAH-ka-shay!'' he taunted, in make-believe Arabic. When a customer asked for a box of hair gel, he tried to sell her a condom.

VUnimed Pharmaceuticals Inc. said today that it was in negotiations to sell all outstanding shares of the company to an unnamed third party. The sale will be handled by Hambrecht & Quist. Trading in the shares was halted before the announcement. Earlier, the stock rose to a 52-week high of $9.25, valuing the company at $84 million. Since the beginning of the year, Unimed's stock price has more than doubled. The company focuses on therapies for cancer and H.I.V. It markets three drugs, including the H.I.V. and cancer treatment Marinol, the only drug to contain THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. Unimed had revenue of $16 million in 1998.

VEvidence abounds that beer is more popular with adolescents than marijuana. But although the Government is spending $195 million this year on its national media campaign to dissuade adolescents from using illicit drugs, not a penny of the appropriated tax dollars is going to warn about the dangers of drinking. So this month, Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California, introduced an amendment allowing underage drinking to be included among the advertising campaign's targets. Her effort has not pleased beer wholesalers, some other members of Congress or even the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy.

VPolice officers today managed to cripple but not quite destroy the largest cocaine smuggling and selling operation in northern New York State in a series of rapid early morning raids, state and Federal officials said. The raids netted a few prize suspects, including a 24-year-old Mohawk man who, the officials said, ran the drug network from his home here. By the time they were finished, shortly before 8 A.M., about 180 police officers from 13 New York, Federal, Canadian and local agencies, including the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Police Department, had captured 26 suspects and charged them with possession and conspiracy to sell cocaine and marijuana, officials said.

V''Coughs due to smoking disappear! Parched throat clears up! That stale, smoked-out feeling vanishes!'' Those claims for a miracle cure can be found in ''The Last Cigarette,'' a witty but deliberately choke-inducing documentary by Kevin Rafferty and Frank Keraudren about the mystique of smoking in America. The real miracle turns out to be somewhat different: those claims were once used to promote even more smoking, with the promise that ''when you change to Philip Morris you'll feel better.'' And that the glamour of the cigarette habit has been so successfully manufactured for so long. A horde of film clips illustrate the movie shorthand of a meaningful gesture and a lighted cigarette. It was an especially valuable prop in the days when films required visual metaphors for what they could not otherwise say, as in a romantic scene that ends with Jennifer Jones and a bare-chested William Holden locking eyes while touching their cigarettes together. And by angrily throwing a cigarette away, John Wayne could make himself look even tougher. There are even glimpses of latter-day smoke-porn videos in which a fully clothed woman, perhaps one with two-inch talons and a tattoo, does nothing but smoke her cigarette and talk about it. And it goes without saying that an actor who pauses before exhaling looks thoughtful, even if he's not.

VA thief, a burglar, a gang member, a drug dealer and a mother stepped into a windowless room in this overbaked city one Tuesday afternoon, strip-searched of pride and any material possession that made them somebody outside the brick-walled room. They are drug addicts in treatment, and every one of them might well be in prison under Federal law and the statutes of most other states. But in defiance of Arizona's political establishment, voters here took the law into their own hands and voted twice, by large majorities, to make their state the first to mandate treatment instead of prison for drug offenders.

VTimothy Egan, in special report Crack's Legacy, notes that Arizona voters, in defiance of state's political establishment, have taken law into their own hands and voted twice, by large majorities, to make their state first to mandate treatment instead of prison for drug offenders; dozen years after national alarm over crack speeded discarding of drug treatment in favor of punitive laws that helped create world's largest prison system, drug policy is taking another turn; treatment is making comeback, driven largely by grass-roots revolt; Arizona, in changing its laws, has taken boldest step; at least 40 states are giving judges and prosecutors discretion within existing laws to steer offenders toward treatment instead of jail through drug courts; number of states are considering changing their mandatory prison laws for drug offenders, most notably New York, which was first to require long sentences for possession of small amounts of drugs 26 years ago; Dr Mitchell Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House of New York, says notion that crack addicts are untreatable is simply nonsense; photo (M)

VSports Illustrated was ordered to pay $8.5 million to a former heavyweight boxer, Randall (Tex) Cobb, in a libel suit over a 1993 article that said he had fixed a fight and shared cocaine with the loser. A Federal jury awarded the compensatory damages Wednesday. It will return on Friday to hear evidence on whether he should get punitive damages. The fighter, 46, had asked for $50 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages.

VHER voice was strained and cigarette-raspy, filled with anguish and despair as she recounted a past ruined by heroin addiction, homelessness and domestic abuse. The tears came when she spoke of her 5-year-old daughter, a pawn in a custody battle. She's not proud of her drug-filled past, littered with memories like the time she vandalized her parents' home or the time she bailed out of life and became a Deadhead, following the Grateful Dead around the country with a motorcycle gang. She swears she has cleaned up her act since she was diagnosed with manic-depression and received treatment. Her methadone-recovery program is working great, she's holding down two jobs and she has a dog. But she won't be happy until she gets her daughter back, she said, breaking down in tears.

VTesting hair to detect illicit drug use, a procedure already popular with at least 1,000 employers in the United States, is now being adopted by some schools, opening a new chapter in the continuing debate over the best way to keep adolescents from experimenting with drugs. De la Salle High School, which is affiliated with the Brothers of the Christian Schools, a Roman Catholic order, began testing the hair of its 870 students here in March 1998 in a pilot program sponsored by the Psychemedics Corporation, the country's leading hair-testing company. Five other Catholic schools in the New Orleans region followed suit.

VThere are two ways to tell when dawn is coming if you are an inmate at the Suffolk County jail. First there are the lights -- they are turned up so the guards can serve breakfast. The other clue is the rattle of steel plates. Breakfast is served precisely at 5:30 A.M. It is usually cold and it is never enough. On a morning early in June it was three undercooked sticks of French toast and tomato juice. The 44 men on the fifth tier declared a hunger strike. ''I might be behind bars, but that don't make me no animal,'' said S Berry, a 23-year-old drug offender who violated his parole.

VFor years, Mohammed Arif denied he had a drinking problem. He saw himself as an immigrant success story: he had mastered a new language, earned enough to support relatives back in his native Pakistan and fit right in when his fellow construction workers hit the bars at the end of the day. ''The thing about drinking was this false pride,'' Mr. Arif said, recalling the dark years when he failed to see how alcohol was corroding his new life. ''There was all this finger-pointing in my family, and it would get me so mad. Why is everyone telling me I've got a drinking problem when it's me who's taking care of everybody?''

VNew York City has seen a dramatic increase in felony drug arrests because of an emphasis on arresting the leaders of narcotics gangs instead of the street-level dealers, police officials told a City Council hearing yesterday. Assistant Chief Charles Kammerdener, commander of the Police Department's Narcotics Division, said that felony arrests are up nearly 10 percent over the same period last year, with the unit making 16,255 arrests. At the same time, misdemeanor arrests have dropped 4 percent to 21,955 arrests.

V''Will tend to corrupt morals, will tend to incite to crime,'' said the New York Censors Board of Dwain Esper's exploitation films ''Maniac'' and ''Narcotic,'' which together with a new edition of Louis Gasnier's ''Reefer Madness'' have been released in a series from Kino International. That was in the 1930's (with reverberations today in the furor over children gaining admission to R-rated movies), when the Production Code cramped mainstream movie-making. Not so the exploitationists, however. ''They really thrived when the rest of Hollywood had to abide by the code,'' said Bret Wood, co-author with Felicia Feaster of ''Forbidden Fruit: The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film'' (Midnight Marquee Press, Baltimore) and producer of the videos.

VSgt. Mike Lewis of the Maryland State Police is a bull-necked, megaphone-voiced, highly caffeinated drug warrior who, on this shiny May morning outside of Annapolis, is conceding defeat. The drug war is over, the good guys have lost and he has been cast as a racist. ''This is the end, buddy,'' he says. ''I can read the writing on the wall.'' Lewis is driving his unmarked Crown Victoria down the fast lane of Route 50, looking for bad guys. The back of his neck is burnt by the sun, and he wears his hair flat and short under his regulation Stetson. ''They're going to let the N.A.A.C.P. tell us how to do traffic stops,'' he says. ''That's what's happening. There may be a few troopers who make stops solely based on race, but thisa they're going to let these people tell us how to run our department. I say, to hell with it all. I don't care if the drugs go through. I don't.''

VTaking a step that is generating heated criticism in Washington, the Colombian Government has begun to include income earned from growing illegal drugs in the way it calculates the size of the nation's economy. The move is controversial but necessary, Colombian officials say, to take account of the increasingly uncontrollable reality of the drug trade, which by obviously imprecise assessments could amount to between one-quarter and one-third of Colombia's legal exports, or as much as $4 billion a year.

VThe intruder wore a white, hooded robe, as if playing dress-up as a priest. When he was startled by an early-bird parishioner, he bolted from the sanctuary, leaving behind a dead Roman Catholic priest wrapped in a green and gold banner. The bloody bundle had been stashed in an out of-the-way section of the pews, beneath the final Station of the Cross. So when the Rev. Robert J. Lysz, the pastor of the Church of St. Matthew, did not show up for Friday's 7:30 A.M. Mass, the 70 or so parishioners figured he had just overslept. A lay minister led a few prayers, read the Gospel, then served the Eucharist.

VThe police thwarted an illicit act of agriculture on Monday when members of the Staten Island Narcotics Unit uprooted 72 fledgling marijuana plants in a remote corner of the Fresh Kills landfill. Lieut. Bob Glass led six narcotics officers to the site on Sanitation Commission property near Fresh Kills Creek, about a quarter mile west of the Staten Island Expressway. Getting to the site, which he called a ''little farm,'' entailed leaving a small paved road and hiking across an overgrown field, then struggling down a corridor through a few hundred yards of thick weeds. In a clearing, the officers found what were described as well-tended marijuana plants eight to 12 inches tall.

VLashanda Washington was a street-smart, fight-hardened girl of 16, riding a city bus home from school, when she saw the face that she had been dreaming about for years. The woman boarding the No. 14 looked older than the one who had long starred in her fading childhood memories. She was thin like an addict and bloated like a drinker. She was scarred like a fighter and worn like a pauper. She was as beautiful as anyone Ms. Washington had ever seen. The girl's heart nearly exploded from the rush of fear and joy.

VMorris County officials say they hope to make it too expensive for promoters to stage any more of the all-night dance parties called raves at the Mennen Arena in Morris Township after 80 people were arrested at one there last weekend, mainly for marijuana possession. Jim Rosenberg, the county administrator, said an outright ban on raves would probably be illegal. But he hopes to discourage them by tripling the $18,200 emergency-services fee charged by the county for dance parties. The increase would reflect the $50,900 cost of police involvement in last weekend's event. He said the promoter, One Productions of Deal, which could not be reached for comment, will be charged the additional $32,700.

VThe delta region of southern Nigeria, where the mighty Niger River drains into the Atlantic Ocean, includes some of the most inhospitable territory on earth. It's the world's largest mangrove swamp, 14,000 square miles of thickets, channels and lagoons all but impenetrable to any but the most practiced eye. It's also oil country, dotted with wells and flow stations, where about two million barrels of crude are collected each day and piped to central stations for transport abroad. Helicopter is the preferred mode of transport, for the lucky few who can afford it. One of those is Leonard Hutto, the superintendent of Chevron's operations in the eastern Niger Delta, and on this day it was his chopper that hovered tentatively above one of Chevron's 30-odd oil stations in the area. The landing pad, a few hundred feet below, was thronged with hundreds of angry young Nigerians peering up at the midmorning sky, clearly shouting and shaking their fists. Seeing that they did not have guns, Hutto finally told the pilot to land.

The brochures asserted that the white race was being crowded out by Jews, blacks and the ''mud people,'' his derogatory term for Asians.

VPeople who knew Benjamin N Smith, who killed himself rather than be captured by police after shooting rampage against members of minority groups in Illinois and Indiana, say he had become increasingly bold in expressing racist views; police say places where shootings occurred in Illinois and Indiana, in which black and Asian man were fatally shot and other blacks, Asians and Jews shot at may not have been random; note shootings occurred in northern suburbs of Chicago where he grew up and near University of Illinois, where he quit in February 1998 before being expelled over domestic violence charges, possessing drugs and posting racist literature; photo; map (M)

VTOMPKINS SQUARE PARK began as a marsh, became a center of protest and is most recently a symbol of how a tattered park can blossom. Though this week it is best known as a murder scene, it is more than that. At the southwest corner, the usual crowd sat on benches under elm trees yesterday afternoon. Some had whisky bottles under their coats, some had track marks on their arms, some were fast asleep. Those who were reasonably sentient discussed the events of the week, specifically the arrest of two men in the killing of a man who had often sat with them.

Boston, for instance, was teeming with oddball tinkerers, some incubated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which nurtured spinoff enterprises. A local electrical workshop was a high-profile hangout useful for spying on rivals and stealing their personnel. (Bell found Watson there.)

Still, he and the player representatives for the 29 teams agree that with the N.B.A. soon to begin testing for marijuana, it is time to educate the masses. During the union's annual meetings in the Bahamas last week, representatives were told to spread the word to their teammates about the league's new drug policy. Since marijuana can stay in a person's system for two to three months, players who use it in July run a risk of being caught in October.

VGIVEN the grippingly bizarre settings and situations that Stanley Kubrick's films favored, what could be more startling than the scene that opens ''Eyes Wide Shut''? It's only the sight of two people who resemble glamorous movie stars getting ready for a black-tie party. ''How do I look?'' she asks, and he says she looks perfect -- even though she is perched on a toilet wearing eyeglasses with her evening gown, and he is too busy studying himself in a mirror to notice. Look no further than this for a sense of what this film's title signifies, or how craftily its illusions of intimacy seduce the viewer. There is consolation for having to read the words ''The End'' on the posthumous work of Mr. Kubrick: this astonishing last film is a spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon. It's one that would have been greeted with the same fascination had its director not died four days after completing it. And it would go on to rattle audiences in the same quietly devastating way. In what proved the riskiest film of his career, the man who could create a whole new universe with each undertaking chose the bedroom as the last frontier, to the point where prolonged conjugal conversations are major events in a long, winding and surreal story. Often accused of creating icy characters, he touched the hidden part of the iceberg this time.

VIT has been more than 35 years since the Holy Modal Rounders' debut album (completed on the eve of President John F. Kennedy's assassination) announced Peter Stampfel and Steve Weber's intention of creating a new, irreverent, benignly irascible world through the found objects of American music, and 18 years since they recorded as a duo. Therefore, the release last week of ''Too Much Fun'' (Rounder CD3163), an ur-assemblage of Civil War relics, jazzy scat, twining fiddle lines and impromptu silliness by a pair who, though leaner and grayer, have kept both sensibility and chops intact, occasions the same sort of feelings of puzzlement and gratitude as an unexpected reunion with a long-lost classmate. Not that the Rounders have ever really gone away. Through the decades Mr. Stampfel and Mr. Weber have appeared with the intermittent regularity of desert wildflowers, accompanied on record by a fluctuating but remarkably loyal group of players. (On ''Too Much Fun,'' they are joined by their 20-plus year associate David Reisch on bass.) Indeed, the term Holy Modal Rounders has proved to be unusually elastic, stretching from the original duo to encompass as many as 10 people on the 1978 album ''Last Round,'' as well as going on hiatus during 1965, when the pair joined up with the seminal Greenwich Village satirists Ed Sanders and Tuli Kupferberg to become the Fugs.

VLOOK out, it leaks,'' Oliver Platt warned his companions as his 1985 Jeep Wagoneer went through the pulsing jets of the Broadway-Houston Car Wash in downtown Manhattan. On July 7, the night before, Mr. Platt had been chatting with David Letterman about his part as a pompous crocodile expert in the horror spoof ''Lake Placid.'' On this night, looking somewhat more disheveled, he was escaping from his East Village household to run errands before the family's drive to Maine the next day. With him was his best friend, the screenwriter David Schwab (as in the Schwab drugstore Schwabs). The two men are the kind of buddies who finish each other's burgers.

V''I don't know what a hippie was,'' said Benjy Eisen as he stood near a sink filled with dishes in a Winnebago parked at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., on Thursday. ''I'm a kid of the 90's. In our generation we don't have Vietnam stories, we have Lollapalooza tales. Our war stories are about the car breaking down on the way to a show.'' Mr. Eisen and 10 friends, none older than 26, had rented the camper to follow the band Phish on its six-week summer tour, stopping in Holmdel that evening and the next. Most of the friends were from New York or Pennsylvania, although one had come all the way from Bakersfield, Calif. They had driven hundreds of miles to see shows from Kansas to Georgia, sleeping alongside one another on increasingly dingy foam beds, selling fruit smoothies to earn spending money, taking time off to play music in state parks, and meeting other travelers at every turn.

VA New York City Police Department policy that took effect this week has some officers wondering whether poppy seed bagels are now as off-limits to them as heroin, graft or consorting with organized crime figures. The policy, which prohibits police officers from using commercial products that may contain illegal drugs or their derivatives, was intended, in part, to make it more difficult for police officers who test positive for drug use to argue that their test results were skewed by their use of certain foods, health care products or cosmetics.

VResearchers working for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Charter Revision Commission recommended 40 potential changes to the City Charter yesterday, including some that would diminish the budgetary and land-use powers of the City Council and others that would change the electoral process. When the Mayor, a Republican, appointed the commission last month, he hinted that his main goal was to deny Mark Green, a liberal Democrat who is the city's Public Advocate, the right to succeed him automatically if Mr. Giuliani is elected to the United States Senate next year. But yesterday, the commission's staff recommended against moving hastily to change the line of mayoral succession.

VSay what you will about New Orleans -- a city that glitters with the sinister beauty of a snake in Barbara Hambly's seductive period mysteries -- it was no place for a black man in the decades before the Civil War. Benjamin January, the cultivated, Paris-educated surgeon who has already encountered prejudice, injustice and yellow fever in this series, is cursed with a voodoo hex in GRAVEYARD DUST (Bantam, $23.95) when he tries to defend his sister, a voodooienne who has been arrested for helping a woman to poison her husband. For all his cosmopolitan sophistication, January has a lingering respect for the dark magic he remembers from his childhood. But with an outbreak of cholera threatening to turn the city into a pestilential sewer, he is even more desperate to rescue his sister from her noxious prison in the Cabildo.

''That last night, after he'd relapsed again, he came to me full of remorse. He said, 'I'm sorry, Mom. I want to go see the doctor in the morning.' But the next morning, I found him dead.

VBefore the music ended, Woodstock '99 started going up in violent flames tonight as marauding bands of shirtless, bellowing men set fire to 12 trucks, looted T-shirts from concession stands and tore open cash machines in search of money. The chaos began around 10:30 P.M. after the Red Hot Chili Peppers finished their set, the final act of the three-day show. As a film tribute to Jimi Hendrix played on a giant screen, dozens of people in the crowd, carrying ''peace candles'' that had been passed out beforehand, used them to set fire to an overturned car.

VA record crowd came to hear and cheer the newest members of baseball's Hall of Fame today. And it was an impressive class of 1999, led by Nolan Ryan, Robin Yount and George Brett, all elected in their first year of eligibility. But those who lined the lawns and hillsides of this historic village gave one of their warmest ovations on a hot day to a star long enshrined. As was the case before the recent All-Star Game at Fenway Park, a roar greeted Ted Williams, 80 years old.

VFor decades, the hard part for drug agents stalking Florida's marijuana growers was finding their crop. The growers weave their plants among corn stalks and even tomato vines to foil aerial searches. In swamps, growers make berms out of muck and chicken wire and plant their crop, leaving fat, black water moccasins to stand guard. Hidden in Florida's lush landscape, the camouflaged marijuana plants often foiled the small army of officers, helicopters and drug-sniffing dogs.

VA Fungus to Kill Marijuana Has Environmentalists Wary
p33134
ssVabstract
p33135
VPlan by Florida's Office of Drug Control to use bioherbicide to kill state's lucrative marijuana business has some politicians and drug enforcement officials excited, but environmentalists very worried; environmentalists say introducing Fusarium oxysporum, soil-borne fungus engineered to specifically attack plants like marijuana, is risky since it could mutate and cause disease not only in wild plants but in crops as well; state's drug control director Jim McDonough says fungus will not be used until tested in rigidly controlled conditions; officials have agreed to quarantine testing of fungus, developed by Ag/Bio Con, at facility outside Gainsville, and any use is probably years away (M)

VNow that Woodstock '99 has ended in a nasty and embarrassing riot, young people are no doubt dying to hear more about how nice the original was in 1969, when there were no ripoff vendors selling $4 bottles of water and we all shared food and lived in peace and yada yada yada yada yada. Thirty years ago I went to a concert with about 500,000 acquaintances and wound up stranded for several days in Bethel, N.Y., in inclement weather with not much in the way of food and even less security. We managed to get along and enjoy ourselves while creating a landmark in American cultural history in our spare time. Obviously, the lesson is that we were nicer than kids today and that everybody under 30 made a terrible mistake by failing to be born right after World War II, when all the truly cool people were coming into the world.

VWith Nigeria's move to civilian rule, one of the songs being played on the radio is ''What Will Tomorrow Bring?'' by Femi Anikulapo-Kuti, son of the Afro-beat pioneer Fela. Fela also fearlessly spoke out against corruption and repression in successive governments, never fleeing into exile despite beatings and arrests. Since Fela's death from AIDS in 1997, Mr. Kuti, who bears an uncanny resemblance to his father, has assumed his political and musical mantles.

VHe said he had dreamed of killing women for 30 years before he found his moment this February, when a middle-aged woman and two teen-agers on a sightseeing trip to Yosemite National Park happened to take a room at the motel where he worked as a janitor. He killed all three women, Cary Stayner told a television reporter on Monday night. Then he laid low, escaping suspicion of the Federal Bureau of Investigation when he was interviewed later in February.

VAfter the night's eye-popping, face-mopping finale, after he put down his horn and retreated to his dressing room or hotel or (at rare intervals) the paneled den of his brick-clad house in Corona, Queens, Louis Armstrong often grouped his guests around his other favorite instrument: his tape recorder. It was in the recording mode. Not that everyone seemed to realize it, or care. Beginning in 1947, Armstrong's bulky reel-to-reel tape machines, transported in a special trunk for travel, captured thousands of hours of raw and intimate chatter, bawdy stories and dirty jokes, noodlings on the trumpet, radio broadcasts and anything else that caught the fancy of the irrepressible trumpeter and vocalist revered as perhaps the greatest figure in jazz.

VLike Austin Powers, the self-styled superheroes of ''Mystery Men'' have only the dimmest suspicions that they are anything short of cool. The way they see it, the world was running out of superheroes, and, well, it was a dirty job but somebody had to do it. Even somebody armed with forks, a shovel, a bad temper or a bowling ball. The kind of paragon who might solemnly intone, as William H. Macy's Shoveler does: ''We've got a blind date with Destiny -- and it looks like she's ordered the lobster.'' Clearly, these aspiring supermen (and one superwoman, played by Janeane Garofalo armed with one weird bowling ball) have been reading too many comic books. And this crafty tongue-in-cheek satire hopes that its audience has, too. This witty if eventually overblown movie is based on the Dark Horse series created by Bob Burden, and it plays off the conventions of the genre at their most absurd. When the Shoveler is told that the stellar Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear with one hilariously quizzical raised eyebrow) is actually mild-mannered Lance Hunt, he notes in bewilderment that Lance wears glasses but the Captain does not. ''That's ridiculous,'' surmises the Shoveler, in a fine display of logic a la Spinal Tap. ''He wouldn't be able to see!''

VKNOWN DEAD By Donald Harstad 323 pages. Doubleday. $23.95. Carl Houseman is a deputy sheriff in Nation County, Iowa. There have been some murders there, strange ones, the kind that start out sort of simple and then ramify into so many corners that all the world seems to be involved. So loaded with potential are these murders that before you know it, various Federal officials are taking over the investigation, pursuing their own mysterious, vaguely international agendas that seem at times to take priority over bringing the killers to justice.

VThe Jets' new 3-4 defense will be unveiled when they open their exhibition season Saturday night in Green Bay, completing a transition begun last year from the 4-3. ''With four linebackers, you can be more active,'' said Bill Belichick, the assistant head coach and Bill Parcells's longtime defensive coordinator. ''You have faster athletes in there and better athletes. You can disguise your pass rushing better.''

The newly painted trolleys rumble nosily down the tracks of the central boulevard Zmaja od Bosne, known during the war as Snipers' Alley.

VA 43-year-old fugitive from Queens who was convicted of sexually abusing his 10-year-old daughter in 1996 has been arrested in Arizona, the New York police said. The fugitive, Erick Rodriguez of Woodside, Queens, had been arrested earlier this year in Pima County, Ariz., on charges of smuggling and selling marijuana. Mr. Rodriguez was handed over to the United States Border Patrol earlier this week, and a background check showed that he was wanted in Queens.

VAbbey loved to play, so much so that her distraught owner gave her to a dog pound. Who, after all, wanted a Chesapeake Bay retriever whose notion of fun was chewing up the curtains? The United States Customs Service did. It recruited Abbey, who otherwise might have been destroyed, and taught her to sniff out illegal drugs. During her three-year tenure at Miami International Airport, Abbey -- or more accurately, Abbey's nose -- has been responsible for more than 155 seizures of smuggled cocaine and heroin, worth $25 million on the street.

VKevin Cerbelli, a 30-year-old with schizophrenia, had been in and out of the psychiatric ward of Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens in the two years preceding the night of Oct. 25, when he walked bare-chested and barefoot into a police station house in Queens, armed with a screwdriver and carrying a rosary. The police say he tried to stab a sergeant in the back with the screwdriver and refused orders to drop it before they shot him four times, killing him, according to the autopsy report, with a bullet to the back.

VIn a pointed challenge to a policy adopted by an increasing number of the nation's high schools, the American Civil Liberties Union said yesterday that it would file suit today against an Oklahoma school district that has administered drug tests to students who want to participate in extracurricular activities like the debate team, chorus and Future Farmers of America. Though the Supreme Court refused last year, without comment, to hear a challenge to a drug-test requirement for after-school programs at an Indiana high school, the A.C.L.U. contends that the Tecumseh School District in Oklahoma has gone a critical step further: many extracurricular activities are tied to courses in the regular school day.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, said: ''While it looks like we have turned the corner with today's report, we must not rest. Too many young people are still using drugs, and we must continue to build on our promising efforts to push the rate of drug use down even further.''

VGetting into the mind of someone afflicted with schizophrenia is no easy assignment, but tonight's ''Dateline'' gives it a dutiful try. The mind is that of the 26-year-old Luca Moylan, who at the age of 14 lost a seemingly happy childhood to an existence of terrifying voices and hallucinations. At 17, he was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. When John Hockenberry, tonight's reporter, met him two years ago, he had already been wandering New York City's streets for a decade, sometimes on drugs. He remembers his life then as befogged and disconnected; he felt trapped in what he calls an ''ultimate loneliness.'' Then with the help of a new medication and a psychiatrist associated with Fountain House, a West Side mental-health center, Mr. Moylan experienced a remarkable turnabout.

VGov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has vowed not to answer questions about whether he has ever used illegal drugs, answered a few this morning and suggested he had not used drugs in the last 25 years. At a brief, informal news conference this morning as he campaigned in southwestern Virginia, Mr. Bush fielded questions for the second straight day about drug use, and explained why he chose to answer a question from The Dallas Morning News on the subject on Wednesday night.

VGeorge W. Bush should not be allowed to get away with ducking the question of whether he has used cocaine or not. More than any other Presidential candidate, he is running a law-and-order campaign. Though he claims to be a compassionate conservative, as Governor of Texas he has shown little compassion for anyone who has broken the law. His philosophy of justice is, in his words, ''Incarceration is rehabilitation,'' and he is especially hard on drug users.

VAFRICA RWANDA: BISHOP TRIED FOR GENOCIDE -- A Roman Catholic bishop went on trial, charged with genocide and other crimes against humanity in connection with the 1994 massacres in Rwanda, in which an estimated half million Tutsi and moderate Hutu died. Bishop Augustin Misago, 56, did not enter a plea and the trial was quickly suspended to allow the court to consider complaints by the defense counsel. (Reuters) SIERRA LEONE: LARGER U.N. PRESENCE -- The United Nations Security Council has tripled the number of military observers in Sierra Leone, to 210, and urged that the country move quickly to begin putting a July 7 peace accord into effect. The accord has been criticized because it grants amnesty to rebel fighters responsible for the deaths and mutilation of thousands of people. Peter Burleigh, the United States representative on the Council, said Washington is committed to prosecuting war criminals, and views the accord as ''the best guarantee for an end to the immense suffering.''

VGOV. George W. Bush is appealingly self-confident. Or is he arrogant? He is engaging and fun loving. Or is he immature? He is, refreshingly, an ordinary guy who has not plotted his whole life to end up in the White House. Or is he too cavalier about the office? He is decisive and sees the big picture. Or is he shallow, impulsive and impatient, not willing to sweat the nitty-gritty of policy? Months after the Republican establishment placed its bets for the party's Presidential nomination with the Governor of Texas, a reappraisal is under way, fueled by a restless press corps, as well as by Mr. Bush's opponents, freshly determined after his first-place finish in a straw poll in Iowa a week ago to slow his seemingly effortless march to the White House.

As Governor, he has ridden his bike five times across the state, run 25 miles in Army gear and jumped off a 10,000-foot-high mountain on a hang-glider. Those activities alone make him a rarity among the 50 governors.

VDawad Joseph, a 16-year-old Staten Island high school sophomore, was walking to his mother's office with four friends one afternoon in May 1997 when the young men found themselves in the middle of a police drug sweep. Mr. Joseph was arrested on charges of possessing and selling drugs, even though police records show no drugs were found on him. When he asked what he had done wrong, he said, one officer told him, ''Don't worry about it. Don't ask any questions.'' Taken to the local station house with about 10 other people, he said, he was strip-searched and put in a holding cell for the night.

VNew York City police arrested more people than ever in 1998, though crime has ebbed to historic lows, but there has also been surge in number of flawed arrests; more and more of those arrested were jailed and released without ever having been formally charged with crime; in 1998, prosecutors dismissed 18,000 of 345,000 arrests made in city even before judge reviewed charges, more than double number four years before; rate of cases rejected by prosecutors grew in 1998 by 41 percent in Bronx and 23 percent in Manhattan; in Brooklyn, one in 13 arrests was dismissed before arraignment, double rate of 1997; citywide, 50 people per day are processed through booking system and released because prosecutors reject charges against them, after they have spent hours overnight in packed holding cells (M)

VThere are some questions worth answering, no matter the consequences. And that is the case in Texas, where George W. Bush, the leading aspirant for the Republican Presidential nomination, has evaded reporters' insistent queries on unsubstantiated rumors that he used cocaine in the distant past. He has employed such circumlocutions as, ''When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.'' But the questions will not go away, nor should they. Contrary to what some pundits would have you believe, the stakes are far higher on this matter than with the superficially similar matter of a candidate's sexual misbehavior. That's because we are prosecuting a ''war'' against illegal drugs in this country with an unprecedented intensity.

VMayor Rudolph W. Giuliani offered strong praise yesterday for the $792 billion Republican tax cut passed by Congress this summer, saying it would be ''great'' if the plan became law. With his remarks, Mr. Giuliani drew a clear distinction on what could be a central issue in a race against Hillary Rodham Clinton for United States Senator. Mr. Giuliani had until now refrained from offering an opinion on the tax cut, the largest in nearly 20 years. President Clinton has pledged to veto it, and prospective Democratic Congressional candidates, Mrs. Clinton among them, have attacked it as a threat to such programs as Medicare and Social Security.

VSome political experts say that the ABC and CNN/Time poll results indicate that the American public may be growing more tolerant of wrongdoing by public figures, in part because so much wrongdoing has been in the news in recent years, especially Presidential wrongdoing. Still, when it comes to past drug usage, at least one candidate, Mayor Lincoln Chafee of Warwick, R.I., is not taking the public's tolerance for wrongdoing for granted, if that tolerance is indeed growing. He figures, having watched Mr. Bush swing and twist on the drug issue, that the best course is not only to trust the tolerance of the American voter but also to tell the truth, and the whole truth, right up front. Get it out and get it over with, he says.

VThe smugglers moved with ease through Miami International Airport and even made their way onto American Airlines planes parked at the gates, stashing heroin in coffee containers in the planes' galleys and hiding cocaine and marijuana in suitcases in the jets' baggage holds, a Federal indictment filed today charged. Once, they even agreed to stash three hand grenades on board, as carry-on baggage. As they went about their illegal business, in plain sight of passengers and airport security officers, Federal investigators said, the smugglers did not worry about being caught by the airline. They were the airline.

VLouis Moore looked scared as he sat in Division 9 of the Shelby County Criminal Court here on a recent summer morning. Mr. Moore, a 19-year-old grill cook at McDonald's, knew he was going to have to go before Judge Joseph B. Brown Jr., plead guilty for his crime and hope that the judge would suspend his sentence and give him probation instead of prison. That was nerve-racking enough. But Mr. Moore was worried further because while this was his first offense, and his first visit to court, he had seen Judge Brown in action many times before, on the year-old nationally syndicated television show ''Judge Joe Brown.''

VOF all the symbols of the 60's -- peace sign, marijuana leaf, electric guitar -- the one that came closest to home for many Americans was a stylized antelope leaping over a chrome hoop. It was affixed to some 8 million Chevrolet Impalas in that decade, out of a phenomenal 1958-85 production run of 13 million. Countless baby boomers came of age in that full-size Chevy, which melded power, pizazz and patriotism -- think of Dinah Shore and commercials for ''baseball, hot dogs and Chevrolet'' -- with old-fashioned value. The line included the right car for just about anybody -- muscular Super Sports for high school hot-rodders, sedate sedans for Gramps and Grandma, family wagons that were the minivans of the day.

What is the name of Mr. Schumer's wife? Has either Mr. D'Amato or Mr. Schumer ever admitted using marijuana or cocaine? Where does Mr. Schumer like to go on vacation? Even the most devoted followers of New York politics would be hard pressed to answer such personal questions about these two familiar politicians, even though they were the headliners of what was arguably the most widely watched Senate contest of 1998. For all the intensity of the Schumer-D'Amato race, this was one area of inquiry that was barely touched -- ignored by candidates, voters and the media alike.

VThe cameras were rolling, and no one needed to yell, ''Action.'' There was plenty to go around over three days at the 1995 annual meeting of the National Football League Players Association in Hawaii. There was bickering, infighting and union politics. There was a union official offering to instruct players on how to beat the salary cap. There was a long debate about the implicit racism some union members believed was behind the league's plan to prohibit players from wearing bandannas. And there were candid discussions of substance abuse, including an assertion by one official that alcohol abuse was the biggest problem among players.

VTeen-agers who do not get along well with their fathers are more likely to smoke, drink and use drugs than youngsters in average two-parent families, according to a national study released today. Further, the study found, even teen-agers from one-parent families, typically headed by mothers, are less at risk from tobacco, alcohol and drugs than those in two-parent families who have poor relationships with their fathers.

VDance Clubs Heeding Call to Tame Wild Life

p36405
VNew York City's big-box dance clubs, long mecca for anything-goes nightlife, have become heavily regulated places where drugs, underage drinking and unseemly behavior are zealously discouraged; are increasingly intolerant of activity that might draw unwanted attention from authorities or neighbors, chastened by increased police scrutiny, powerful neighborhood opposition and Govt's highly public war against against night-life magnate Peter Gatien; largest dance establishments have adopted tight security measures since 1998, when prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to convict Gatien for allegedly turning clubs, Limelight and Tunnel, into drug bazaars; use of metal detectors and full body searches have become standard procedure, and most clubs employ battalions of security guards--some of whom work undercover and solicit crowds for illegal drugs; photos (M)

VMayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday defended the fatal police shooting of a mentally disturbed, hammer-wielding man in Borough Park, Brooklyn, which brought hundreds of angry Hasidic protesters into the streets of the heavily Orthodox neighborhood late Monday night. ''There appears to be every reason to believe that the police officers acted in accordance with police procedure and acted in a responsible way to save human life,'' the Mayor said, cautioning only that the investigation was still in its early stages.

VA Bronx woman who was convicted of criminally negligent homicide in the starvation death of her infant son was sentenced yesterday to five years' probation by a judge who said that a jail term would ''not serve the public interest or rehabilitate the defendant.'' The woman, Tabitha Walrond, 21, shed tears of relief as she was sentenced in State Supreme Court in the Bronx by Judge Robert H. Straus, who rejected the prosecution's request for a jail term of six months. But Judge Straus admonished Ms. Walrond to accept responsibility for the death of her 2-month-old son, Tyler, and to ''reject the theories of victimization'' advanced by people who have protested her conviction. He also ordered her to undergo psychological counseling.

VThree Rappers, Three Courtrooms As coincidences go, this one was up there. Three rap stars were scheduled to be in court yesterday: SEAN (PUFFY) COMBS and BUSTA RHYMES in Manhattan, and O.D.B. (RUSSELL T. JONES in court papers) in Queens. Mr. Combs pleaded guilty to a violation -- an infraction less serious than a misdemeanor -- in connection with the beating of a rap producer, STEVEN STOUTE, in April. Mr. Combs, who was originally charged with assault -- a felony -- is said to have been angry that Mr. Stoute would not change a music video to remove a scene that appeared to show Mr. Combs being nailed to a cross.

VThe same week that a Republican candidate for President spent struggling to compose ever more tortuous nondenials of his drug use as a young man, a former Republican Presidential candidate could be seen in full-page advertisements forthrightly acknowledging his own use of another drug. Oh, I know: two completely different and incomparable situations; how unfair to Robert Dole and the Pfizer pharmaceutical company even to mention them in the same paragraph as George W. Bush and cocaine. One concerns an illegal drug that people take strictly for pleasure. The other concerns a legal drug that people take . . . well, also strictly for pleasure, but (almost) always with a prescription. The ability to draw and patrol distinctions of this kind becomes critical in a society like ours, with its two thriving multi-billion-dollar drug cultures. Everyone understands that licit and illicit drugs are not the same. How much easier things would be if, instead of having to lump them all under the rubric of ''drugs,'' we had one word for the beneficent class of molecules to which Viagra and Prozac belong, and another for the pernicious class that contains cocaine and cannabis.

VIn the gloom before dawn, under the hulking metal girders in Queens Plaza, the Department of Correction bus cruised to a stop. The doors opened, and 30 Rikers Island inmates poured into the trash-strewn street to freedom. The first man kicked the bus as waiting buddies whooped. Others slapped high-fives and called to the few prostitutes still slouching by at 5:30 A.M. Most, lugging their belongings in oversize bags of clear plastic or brown paper, loped quickly toward the glow of two all-night doughnut shops.

VClass-action lawsuit accuses New York City of releasing mentally ill inmates without follow-up care; Justice Louise Gruner Gans has issued temporary restraining on behalf of two plaintiffs in suit, requiring city to provide them with medication and referrals for expedited Medicaid, treatment and shelter; advocates say that city treats more than 15,000 seriously mentally ill inmates as patients each year, but typically releases them the same way it does any other inmate, forcing them into a revolving door of deterioration and re-arrest; photo (M)

VA helicopter clatters loudly over the northeast corner of Yellowstone National Park, flying low and slow to snap images of the patchwork of creeks, meadows, pine and fir. But instead of an ordinary camera, the helicopter carries a device that uses detectors precisely made of crystal and kept by liquid nitrogen at minus 273 degrees Fahrenheit. Called a hyperspectral camera or a hyperspectral imaging spectrometer, it is one of a new generation of sensing instruments that experts predict will transform many areas, including ecosystem management, agriculture, diamond and gold mining, hazardous waste cleanup and even wild-land firefighting.

VThe man who walked into the Wedgwood Baptist Church here on Wednesday did not look like he belonged to the congregation. No one knew what this man in blue jeans and a black leather jacket, Larry Gene Ashbrook, might want. People would later learn that he was a jobless loner, an ex-sailor prone to foul moods and feared by several of his neighbors. But at that moment, the only thing that seemed strange was that he was smoking a cigarette in church. A janitor approached him about the cigarette, and the authorities say Mr. Ashbrook shot him. He shot a woman sitting nearby in the head. And then he followed the sounds of music and voices into the main sanctuary, where hundreds of teen-agers had gathered for a contemporary Christian music concert. He walked inside and began firing.

VWarning of a worrisome new trend in smoking among young people, Massachusetts health officials released the country's first official study today on the prevalence among teen-agers of smoking skinny, sweet-flavored and highly potent cigarettes called bidis that are hand-rolled in India and faddishly popular. The study, whose results are highly approximate because they were not based on a rigorously random sample, found that among 642 teen-agers in the Boston inner city surveyed this spring, 40 percent had tried a bidi (pronounced beedee), nearly 16 percent smoked bidis currently and nearly 8 percent were ''heavy users'' who had smoked more than 100.

VWith funerals for the seven victims in the Wedgwood Baptist Church shootings scheduled to begin this weekend, Fort Worth residents held candlelight vigils and prayer services today as the police conceded that they might never know why the attack happened. In what city officials said was their final news briefing in the case, the Acting Chief of Police, Ralph Mendoza, said the investigative phase of the case had essentially ended despite unanswered questions about why the gunman, Larry Gene Ashbrook, opened fire on Wednesday at a church service for teen-agers.

VA Federal judge ruled today that the board of elections and ethics for the District of Columbia may count and announce the results of a referendum on the use of marijuana for medical purposes that was on the ballot in November. District of Columbia residents voted last November on Initiative 59, a measure to allow chronically ill people like those suffering from AIDS, cancer and glaucoma, to use marijuana without facing criminal prosecution. Under current law, possession of marijuana is a misdemeanor charge, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of $1,000.

VFrom the top of Second Mesa, one of three flat-topped mountains here that are the foundation of the remote Hopi reservation, the view of vast high desert, empty to the horizon, is the sort to inspire ruminations on man's existential solitude. And when the cloudburst came late on Friday afternoon, with prongs of lightning blanching the enormous sky, thunderclaps to wake the dead and hailstones dropping like bullets of the gods, it almost seemed as though the natural spirits that are worshiped by the Hopi were reminding the mortal of their mortality. But maybe it was merely Mother Nature's sense of moment. The storm passed, a full rainbow appeared across the western face of the mesa, and at sunset the red rock glowed like an ember, warm and welcoming. And just about then, the visiting reggae bands on the Teva Spirit of Unity Festival tour took the stage at the Hopi Veterans Center, just below the lip of the mountain ledge, and some 2,000 reggae fans went crazy. For six hours, the gymnasium-like auditorium throbbed with life, in spectacular isolation under a thrillingly bright half-moon.

VOn a day when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani went to Brooklyn to tout the renewal of the Bushwick neighborhood, once considered one of the most notorious drug bazaars in the country, Pipo Rios opened a 40-ounce malt liquor and contemplated his business not far from where the Mayor spoke. Mr. Rios used to sell crack in the neighborhood, but street-level drug dealers are hard-pressed to make a living these days, he said. So now he deals in Tommy Hilfiger knockoffs. ''I can make more money selling these,'' he said, pointing to a stack of the jackets inside his cramped kitchen, ''especially on Friday nights.''

VMore than 10 months after they cast ballots, residents of the District of Columbia were told today that they had overwhelmingly voted in favor of a measure that would allow marijuana to be used for medical purposes. Congressional opponents of the measure had blocked a count of the initiative, but Judge Richard W. Roberts of Federal District Court here ruled on Friday that the restriction was illegal.

VResidents of Washington, DC, are told they overwhelmingly voted in favor of measure that would allow marijuana to be used for medical purposes, more than 10 months after they cast their ballots; Congressional opponents of measure had blocked count of initiative until Federal Judge Richard W Roberts rules that their effort was illegal; despite vote, it is not certain that measure will become law because of expected effort in Congress to block measure (M)

VFederal law-enforcement officials said today that they had completed a two-year international investigation that led to the arrest of more than 90 drug traffickers and the seizure of 13 tons of cocaine, 2 1/2 tons of marijuana and more than $19 million. The smuggling operation was centered in Mexico and funneled Colombian cocaine across the Rio Grande to McAllen, Tex., where it was stored in warehouses before being trucked beneath loads of fruits and vegetables to New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and San Diego. Then it was shipped to distributors in other major cities for street sales, the officials said today.

VIn the political game, it is known as ''inoculation'' -- going public with a confession of some sin before your opponent can sting you with an accusation of it. And in an age when such stinging is on the rise, not only by opponents but also by the press, so is self-inoculating. Early on in his quest for the Republican Presidential nomination, Senator John McCain of Arizona began talking of how he had strayed in his first marriage before ending up in a divorce.

VAfter being led from her eponymous Fifth Avenue art gallery in handcuffs late Wednesday and spending a sleepless night and the better part of a day in custody, the art dealer Mary Boone assailed the police yesterday for arresting her on charges of illegally distributing ammunition that was part of an exhibition. ''This is an outrageous attack on the artistic rights to express themselves,'' Ms. Boone said after her arraignment about 8 P.M. yesterday at Criminal Court in Manhattan, still in the sleeveless orange dress and high-heel shoes she was wearing when she was arrested around 6 P.M. Wednesday. ''It's all a First Amendment issue,'' she said.

VThe man who was fired as Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police after making public comments linking minority groups to drug crimes said today that his removal was an example of reverse discrimination and that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman had planned all along to replace him with a minority-group member. In his first public remarks since he resigned under pressure, the former Superintendent, Carl A. Williams, 59, said he had been used as a political scapegoat and unfairly branded a racist simply because he made comments about racial profiling that ''were the truth'' in a newspaper interview with The Star-Ledger of Newark in February.

VOnly hours after a fatal police shooting brought hundreds of Hasidic protesters to the streets of a Brooklyn neighborhood, Police Commissioner Howard Safir, defending his officers, could hardly have been more specific in describing how and why the police fired 12 bullets into a mentally disturbed, hammer-wielding man: he was in the midst of beating a sergeant with the hammer. That man, Gidone Busch, was shot to save the officer's life, Commissioner Safir said. With Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a cluster of hastily assembled Jewish leaders by his side, Mr. Safir said at a City Hall news conference on Aug. 31 that pepper spray had failed to stop Mr. Busch and that he was attacking two fallen officers, smashing his hammer repeatedly into one of them.

VBlack politicians and community leaders in New Jersey voiced disappointment and anger yesterday at the news that the former superintendent of the State Police, who was ousted from his job after making public remarks associating members of minority groups with drug trafficking, was saying he was a victim of bias. The superintendent, Carl A. Williams, 59, resigned under pressure in February after his remarks appeared in The Star-Ledger of Newark about racial profiling, the illegal police practice of stopping and searching drivers based on their race. Last week, the State Senate confirmed the appointment of a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Carson Dunbar Jr., as his replacement. Mr. Dunbar, who is black, is expected to assume the post later this fall.

VThe wired Latrell Sprewell has a beeper, a cell phone and an E-mail address but has not used one of those methods to communicate with the Knicks this week. Not even an old-fashioned flare. Somewhere, he's out there. But as Day 3 of training camp passed today, the increasingly frustrated Knicks still had no idea when their enigmatic star would arrive. After a California jury ordered him to pay $104,940 on Tuesday to two people injured in a car accident he caused in 1998, he apparently made a stop in his hometown of Milwaukee Tuesday night.

VWith the United States-Mexico border as her backdrop, Elizabeth Dole vowed today to more than double the number of Border Patrol agents if elected President, not as a way to fight illegal immigration but to block the flow of drugs from Latin America to the United States. Mrs. Dole, who is seeking the Republican nomination for President, promised a renewed commitment to the war on drugs, bringing into the fight two agencies, the United States Border Patrol and the National Guard, whose primary mission has not traditionally focused on fighting drug trafficking.

Since 1996, the state's famously tough work rules have swept more than 57,000 families from the rolls and turned a war on welfare into a social experiment commanding international attention. Almost 90 percent of the families that were getting welfare checks three years ago no longer receive them, and envious bureaucrats from around the globe visit the state to hear officials boast of the disappearing dole.

VSEVERAL years ago, David A. Landgrebe, a professor at Purdue University's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering who studies satellite imagery, found himself describing his research in deep technical detail to a local judge when they met socially. ''I went through the whole spiel and wondered what he would ever do with the information,'' Dr. Landgrebe recalled. ''When I asked the judge, he said: 'There's more lying going on in the courtroom, and I need to make a decision. One lawyer describes some land as worthless. Another claims it's worth a fortune. I want something to trust.''

VAre you a unique individual? What a stupid question! How could you not be? You are the only person ever to have been born at 12:08:32 A.M. on June 17, 1973, in the maternity ward of Enos T. Throop Memorial Hospital in Picpus, N.Y. You are easily distinguishable from the infants born in the same location on the same day at 12:07 and 12:09, respectively -- their parents were different from yours, for one thing, unless, of course, you are one of a set of twins or triplets. Even then, your fingerprints will be unique, and the graph of your voiceprint equally singular, identifiably yours alone, even when you talk in a growl or a falsetto. Anyway, the important thing is that you know that you are you, an inimitable human being, with a collection of tastes, tendencies, tropisms, penchants and small perversities that have never been gathered together in exactly the same way in the history of the world. So how do you express this uniqueness of yours? Maybe you always and unfailingly wear red socks. Or you wear your watch on the pulse side of your wrist. Or you have a hummingbird tattooed just above your ankle. Or you carry special imported tea bags with you everywhere and will drink nothing else. Or you are never seen without your tiny, trembling dog. Or you have a cabochon emerald implanted in one of your front teeth. Or you drive a converted army ambulance. Or you write with a fountain pen the size of a celery stalk. Or you wear shorts even in winter. Or you wear a baseball cap even to church. Or you wear the same outfit every day. Or you rig your car with vanity plates that encode your nickname. Or you have everything monogrammed, down to your unmentionables.

VTwo years after the beginning of a public campaign by the police to sweep drug dealers out of Washington Square Park that involved surveillance cameras and stepped-up enforcement, residents say dealers have moved their operations out of camera range to surrounding streets. ''Right now, outside my window, I see six dealers across the street,'' said Community Board 2's district manager, Arthur Strickler, whose office overlooks Bleecker Street and La Guardia Place. ''Drug vultures have descended upon us.''

VON a recent episode of the new NBC drama ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,'' a male character referred to ''getting a Lewinsky.'' Most of the audience instantly understood what he was talking about. Although the epilogue to the sordid impeachment scandal is still being written -- Monica S. Lewinsky has accepted a $1 million weight loss challenge from a fitness chain, Linda R. Tripp awaits trial in Maryland and Kenneth W. Starr plans to exit the national stage this week -- there are constant reminders of our long national nightmare in Americans' everyday speech.

VNew Jersey voters are basking in the silence of the October dead zone, the political season when nothing interesting crosses their radar, and even if it did, polls suggest they probably wouldn't care. The barbed anonymous-fax wars between the dueling Democrats for United States Senate, Jon Corzine and Jim Florio, have paused, for now, while both campaigns stock up on fresh boxes of ink cartridges. The shock of Governor Whitman abdicating from the United State Senate race last month has also subsided, and the crop of aspiring Republican replacements have stayed off the airwaves and out of the headlines.

The former World Boxing Organization champion entered his plea before Judge John Lineberger. Morrison was arrested Sept. 16, less than a week after he was placed on two-year probation for a Tulsa, Okla., drunken-driving charge. In Arkansas, the boxer was charged with cocaine possession, simultaneous possession of drugs and firearms, being a felon in possession of a firearm, possession of drug paraphernalia, misdemeanor possession of marijuana and driving while intoxicated.

Leaders of the players association said that a core provision of the drug-testing effort had been violated, and the entire program called into question, because a reporter had learned that about a half-dozen players tested positive for marijuana early this month, during the first week of tests.

They tell of a 13-year-old boy, Ronald Jean, barely 5 feet and 100 pounds, who was abandoned by his mother at a Greyhound bus station three months earlier. The newspaper report said the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services was at the end of its search for the woman who, along with her 3-year-old daughter, boarded a bus and left Jean crying in the depot after he refused to accompany them on a trip to New York.

VBefore you decide whether to seek the Presidency of these United States on the Reform Party ticket -- and they say they are interested if you are -- there are some things you should know. The party's leftists are recruiting an anti-abortion, anti-immigration creationist, Pat Buchanan, as their champion. The party's centrists -- the heirs of prairie populism, with its dirty fingernails and rage at Eastern elites -- are eyeing a New York developer, Donald Trump, who made his fortune castling the rich and beating poorer people at games of chance. The party's most popular leader, Jesse Ventura, has contempt for one of its founding goals -- and some of the potential candidates are not precisely sure what those are, anyway. You should probably also know that it is not the best oiled of political machines. This year's national convention ended when the party's lease expired on a small ballroom at the Hyatt in Dearborn, Mich., and the battle-weary delegates -- drained by fights over whether to drop the word ''paperless'' from the platform or to change ''government reform'' to ''political reform'' -- got the boot.

VA professor of anthropology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who has studied drugs and drug cultures for 25 years was accused in a Federal complaint yesterday of misusing funds from a $2.6 million Federal grant to buy drugs for addicts he interviewed and to pay for travel and other personal expenses. The professor, Ansley Hamid, 55, was accused of misusing thousands of dollars in grant money in 1996 and 1997 to pay for trips to Florida, Hawaii and Trinidad, to buy compact disks and CD equipment and to hire two research assistants who worked mainly on his book manuscripts, all unrelated to his study of drug use in New York City.

Until the closing minutes of the 60-minute nationally televised gathering at Dartmouth College, the candidates also resisted turning their fire on the one who was not there, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner. Finally, Steve Forbes, the publisher who is financing his own campaign, attacked the Governor as obsessed with amassing a war chest and not subjecting himself to debates.

VDemonstrating again what Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has called its underdeveloped capacity for self-restraint, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly for a bill that would make it a crime for doctors to prescribe drugs to help terminally ill patients end their lives. If the principles of federalism -- to which I'd bet many of those voting for this bill fervently swear allegiance -- mean anything, this issue is none of Congress's business. When the Supreme Court declined in 1997 to read into the due process clause a constitutional right to medical assistance in committing suicide, it emphasized that this is a matter for decision at the state level.

VOregonians have long prided themselves on being in the forefront on many social issues -- sometimes with ideas that catch on in the rest of the nation, and sometimes not. They were among the first to decriminalize marijuana and to approve its use for medicinal purposes, and they legalized abortion years before the Supreme Court issued the Roe v. Wade decision. They were the first to conduct an election entirely by mail, and they have long had some of the strictest growth-management regulations in the nation. They even live in one of two states that resolutely refuse to let customers pump their own gasoline at service stations.

VFor a few festive hours tonight, millions of children and adults will happily dress up or don masks and pretend to be something or someone they are not. On Tuesday, the National Basketball Association's regular season will open for the 53d time, while a majority of players begin their 82-game version of All Hallows' E'en, dressing up as entertainers and role models, masking their off-court dependence on a post-game treat of choice: smoking a joint. The trick was always not getting caught, a rather simple matter given the fact that since the league's original antidrug program debuted back in 1984, the union put up a stoned wall against marijuana testing. While the National Football League, Major League Baseball and the United States Olympic Committee all tested for the main human urinary metabolite of marijuana, the N.B.A. never did. Over time, drug-treatment experts declared that the league's drug program, trumpeted by Commissioner David Stern and others for its vision and toughness, was far more puff than policy, designed to treat public relations problems, not drug problems -- as it turned out, with good reason. The league was basically going up in smoke, a clear-eyed conclusion my co-authors, Harvey Araton, a columnist for The New York Times, and Martin F. Dardis of Sports Illustrated, and I came to three years ago while reporting ''Money Players,'' a book about the N.B.A. under Stern.

VFor a quarter-century, Dr. Ansley Hamid was a creative researcher and trailblazing anthropologist, discovering and documenting trends in urban drug use that were closely watched and, in some cases, celebrated by academics and drug-use experts nationwide. With notebook in hand, Dr. Hamid, with his bushy beard and jumble of hair, would trudge into America's drug underworld, talking to addicts and users and documenting such trends as the advent of crack in New York. But his ''crowning achievement,'' as the professor put it, came in 1996, when the federal government awarded $2.6 million to Dr. Hamid's employer, the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, so he could head a five-year study of heroin use in New York's toughest neighborhoods.

Hynes announced yesterday. The killing of the man, Gidone Busch, 31, on Aug. 30 brought hundreds of Hasidic protesters to the streets of the heavily Orthodox Borough Park neighborhood and attracted attention because of the stark differences between Police Commissioner Howard Safir's first description of what happened and the accounts of witnesses on the street.

Five people were injured in what the police say they believe started as a verbal altercation inside the bar, Sadie's Place, and spilled outside onto the sidewalk. Three players and two of their friends were set upon by an armed group of six or more men, the police said.

VTwo years ago, Jeff Van Gundy was nearly fined by the National Basketball Association for saying, among other things, ''Unfortunately in the N.B.A. now, we're making up rules to hide deficiencies of players.'' The assessment did not go over well with the people entrusted with putting more panache in the game. Two years later, the jury is still out on whether rule changes instituted this season have heightened the league's quality of play. Predictably, Grant Hill, a graceful and athletic player, likes them. Alonzo Mourning, low on skill and big on muscle, does not.

VIt was in 1923, just eight years before Hollywood made ''Frankenstein,'' about the use of giant blasts of electricity to jolt life from the dead, that the state of Florida began to electrocute people who had been tried and sentenced to death. Residents of rural areas like the countryside around the state prison, in north-central Florida, had yet to receive electric power. But from Florida oak, inmates at the prison made a chair, fitted with cables and electrodes, leather cuffs and straps and a metal hat. Wired to a generator, it delivered 2,300 volts, at high amperage, directly to the brain when the executioner pulled a switch on the control panel. The executioners were hooded white men, paid volunteers. The first five electrocutions were all of black men, and so were five of the next six. The state electric chair was supposed to be a humane advance, an improvement on the habit of hanging people, county by county, in public squares. But from the beginning, it was also the symbol of the obliterating power of the state, the instrument of an arbitrary and biased system, and a violent and sometimes unreliable means to conflicting political ends. In Ohio, in the late 1870's, electricity had been used to shock prisoners made to sit naked in pans of water. It was in New York, in 1887, that a legislative commission asked Thomas Edison if electricity could provide a more civilized execution than rope.

VHEAT 113, PACERS 101 Alonzo Mourning scored 33 points and the Miami Heat again displayed newfound firepower last night, beating the visiting Indiana Pacers, 113-101. The Heat, adapting to rule changes designed to increase scoring, topped 100 points for the third time in four games. It reached the 100 mark only four times last season despite winning the Atlantic Division and never scored more than 102.

Under a pilot program that started last month, Michigan had been requiring welfare applicants at three sites, including one in Detroit, to pass a drug test or be denied benefits.

VANDRE YOUNG, better known as Dr. Dre, hasn't exactly been silent since he released his first solo album, ''The Chronic,'' in 1992. He produced Snoop Doggy Dogg's debut album, Tupac Shakur's ''All Eyez on Me,'' and Eminem's ''The Slim Shady LP,'' all multimillion sellers, while rapping on their albums and co-starring in their video clips. But on his new album, ''Dr. Dre 2001'' (Interscope 069490486), Dr. Dre sounds defensive, as if he's worried that hip-hop considers him a has-been. ''Now we got a new era of gangstas, hustlers and youngsters living amongst us, looking at us now, calling us busters,'' he admits in ''The Watcher,'' adding, ''It's funny how time flies.'' So he reiterates his resume, and he insists that he's still tough, still authentic, still relevant. ''I'm still at it,'' he insists in ''Still D.R.E. ''Takin' my time to perfect the beat, and I still got love for the streets.''

VAfter his fracas with Shaquille O'Neal last Wednesday night, Charles Barkley walked briskly down a corridor of the Compaq Center in Houston. He had just been thrown out of a game the Rockets would go on to lose to the Lakers, dropping Houston to 0-5 for the first time since 1982. ''Hey Charles, why didn't you deck him?'' a television reporter asked Barkley on the run. Barkley said O'Neal was ''a big boy,'' and proceeded to engage in his usual brainless chitchat with reporters, making them laugh before walking out of the arena.

VDR. DRE, who has sold more than 20 million albums as a rapper and producer, feels like an underdog again. ''For the last couple of years, there's been a lot of talk out on the streets about whether or not I can still hold my own, whether or not I'm still good at producing,'' he said. ''That was the ultimate motivation for me. Magazines, word of mouth and rap tabloids were saying I didn't have it any more. What more do I need to do? How many platinum records have I made? O.K., here's the album -- now what do you have to say?'' Dr. Dre, 34, was talking about his second solo album, ''Dr. Dre 2001,'' in the lounge of a midtown Manhattan hotel on the afternoon before his Oct. 23 appearance on ''Saturday Night Live.'' Wearing an oversized Fubu jersey and fielding handshakes from his Avirex-branded entourage as he talked, he was rousing himself after waking up late. The reason, he said, was that his wife had made him play the album five times the night before. ''She's big on it,'' he said.

VThe investigators came late last January, on a Thursday. They were deliberately cryptic. All they would tell St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center was that they were looking into a possible violation of the federal ''anti-dumping'' law, which prohibits hospitals from refusing to at least examine and stabilize patients who cannot pay. It was serious business. Only a handful of cases were investigated each year. Not until the investigators left did the hospital learn what it was all about. The previous July, a French woman in her 40's had come to the emergency room with abdominal pain. Pelvic cancer was suspected, and she was admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology floor, where the diagnosis was confirmed. A private doctor, along with the house staff, attended to her. The doctor concluded that she needed surgery within several weeks followed by chemotherapy. The woman had no insurance. The senior physician discharged her, and left a note on the woman's chart saying she had instructed her to obtain health insurance or go to a public hospital.

VIt was not uncommon in the 1970's for the children of celebrities to walk among the grizzled, bourbon-swilling veterans in the newsroom of The Tennessean, this city's once-muckraking morning newspaper. Bobby Kennedy's son David and Arthur Schlesinger's son Andrew passed through briefly, as did Judge John Sirica's son Jack, and Henry Aaron's daughter Gaile. So it raised few eyebrows in September 1971 when the latest $95-a-week greenhorn, a shaggy-haired 23-year-old named Albert A. Gore Jr., was assigned one of the heavy metal desks in the front of the office, where city editors kept an eye on their most inexperienced charges. Here comes another one, the old guys muttered. This time it was the son and namesake of Tennessee's recently deposed United States senator, presumably looking to pad his resume before following his father into politics.

VTwo advocates of the medicinal use of marijuana pleaded guilty today to growing more than 6,000 plants and selling the drug, saying their only hope was to ask for a judge's mercy after they were precluded from raising medical issues in their defense. The two men, Peter McWilliams and Todd McCormick, intended to tell jurors about the state law passed by voters in 1996 allowing marijuana use for medical purposes, its purported benefits and their own health. Mr. McWilliams has AIDS, and Mr. McCormick has fused vertebrae from childhood cancer treatments.

VThe Jets began scrambling today to change part of their game plan, their defensive alignments and their special teams personnel in the wake of the suspension of nose tackle Jason Ferguson. Ferguson, described by Coach Bill Parcells as his best and strongest defensive lineman, learned after Wednesday's practice that his appeal of a four-game suspension for violating the National Football League's steroid policy had been denied.

VMATT E. SILVER, the rave music producer, anxiously paced the bar at Wetlands on Tuesday night, waiting for his friend, the alternative rock star Perry Farrell, to speak. ''Perry looks like a little boy up there,'' Mr. Silver said. The Spitfire college speaking tour had hit New York. The tour features musicians, actors like Woody Harrelson, and advocates speaking on topics ranging from the legalization of marijuana to vegetarianism. For Wetlands, the eco-friendly nightclub in TriBeCa, it was another night of youthful idealism, as the crowd, mostly of college age, milled around in hemp clothing and T-shirts with slogans like ''Please don't eat Babe for breakfast.'' Michael Franti, a rapper in dreadlocks, read fiery freestyle poetry. Julia Butterfly Hill, an environmental attention-getter, called from her cell phone in her treehouse home in Stafford, Calif.

VLawrence Funderburke remembers a conversation between him and Chris Webber in May 1998, days after Webber was dealt to Sacramento from Washington. Funderburke, one of just a few players still on the Kings' roster from two seasons ago, recalled trying to assuage Webber's worst fears about playing for a perennial lottery team. ''He kind of blew me off,'' Funderburke said of their talk. ''And we were really good friends. So I'm like, 'Chris, come on.' I knew he was upset by the trade. I just didn't know how long he would take to get over it.''

The search party is looking here and at three other sites in Chihuahua state for the bodies of more than 100 Mexican and American citizens who have disappeared. Most had some tie, even if peripheral, to the drug trade, government authorities say, and it is presumed that most were executed by traffickers or their agents.

VAl Gore used to be a stick-to-the-script kind of guy. Lots of mind-numbing facts about the gross domestic product. But since he revamped his campaign two months ago after a slide in the polls, Mr. Gore has also revamped himself and thrown out the script of his standard stump speech. Now, the vice president is trying to appeal to real people by portraying himself as a real person, too. He does not make full-blown speeches; he chats. He wanders into living rooms to talk with 30 people or into school gymnasiums to talk with 300 and conducts Oprah-style discussions, which he calls open meetings. He sometimes relies on stock answers to convey his positions on the issues: He wants to resubmit the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that the Senate recently rejected. He wants to bring ''revolutionary change'' to public schools. He wants to give health insurance to all children. [Excerpts, Page A28.]

VThe Clinton administration faced a notably skeptical Supreme Court today as it tried to persuade the justices that the Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction over tobacco and the authority to regulate cigarettes as ''drug delivery devices.'' The crowded courtroom became, for an intense hour, the current battleground in the tobacco wars that have swept through Congress and presidential politics. But the familiar policy arguments took second place to a prolonged dissection of food and drug law.

Several hours later, a deputy stopped the sport utility vehicle driven by the young man, Morgan Grams, and 10 bags of marijuana were soon found. Nine were in the possession of a 17-year-old boy who was one of two juveniles also in the truck, and he was arrested.

Mr. Drake is now being held on Rikers Island, accused of attacking Nicole Barrett with a brick three weeks ago. But before his latest trip to the correctional center, he was an aggressive street hustler who haunted the west side of Manhattan, panhandling and scamming drug users between West 28th and West 43rd Streets, and seeking warmth and easy marks in the Port Authority bus terminal.

Rats scurrying around piles of garbage on a narrow sidewalk just outside the entrance. Mice infesting rooms and closets. Unsecured and poorly lighted stairwells, with marijuana smoke wafting up from the floors below. Weeks without incoming phone service. Harassment by addicts from a nearby drug treatment center. But this was not some dark corner of a slumlord's empire; it was a New York City public school. These are the conditions that the teachers, students and administrators of Satellite Academy High School found when they were forced to move into a temporary site this fall on West 35th Street in Manhattan, conditions that have still not been entirely relieved.

VMayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki each proposed laws yesterday that would sharply increase the penalties faced by people who repeatedly commit misdemeanor crimes, like trespassing, turnstile-jumping and selling small amounts of marijuana. The proposals were revealed three days after a petty criminal with a long record was arrested in the brick attack of a woman in Midtown Manhattan. Though aides to the mayor and the governor denied that their plans were in direct response to the attack, they repeatedly cited the case of the petty criminal, Paris Drake, 32, in discussing their proposals. Mr. Drake has a 17-year criminal history of cycling in and out of jail after mostly misdemeanor convictions.

VAs we contemplated what people a thousand years from now might want to know about us, a question naturally arose: what's missing from our picture of the world a thousand years ago? One answer was obvious: a sense of the experience of everyday life -- the sights, sounds and sensations that time washes away almost instantly. For the Times Capsule, we set out to document the texture of life today, at least in a single place at a single moment. And so, on Sept. 9, 1999, at 9:09 a.m., a moment chosen strictly for its symmetry, more than a hundred writers, photographers, artists, sound recordists, filmmakers and students fanned out across the five boroughs to document a single minute -- the same minute -- in the life of New York. They came back with a mosaic of 60 ordinary seconds that will, we hope, last a millennium. B - Bronx M - Manhattan Q - Queens B - Brooklyn S - Staten Island M - Stills from a Film by Bennett Miller outside Grand Central Terminal This film and other audiovisual contributions to the New York Minute can be seen and heard in their entireties at www.nytimes.com/nyminute. 339 cars and trucks entered New York City: 12 via the Bayonne Bridge; 18, Goethals Bridge; 147, George Washington Bridge; 38, Holland Tunnel; 85, Lincoln Tunnel; 39, Outerbridge Crossing. Traffic police officers issued 46 parking tickets. M - Michael Schmelling Municipal Building, Chambers Street A kiss is more than just a kiss for Suzanna Remedios and Hormoz Sabet, who have just exchanged wedding vows in a civil service at the marriage bureau. M - Charles Harbutt Fifth Avenue and 13th Street Jamal Rahimi, a vendor from Afghanistan, serves up morning sustenance. M - Merry Alpern West 12th Street Q - Aaron Lee Fineman Rikers Island Badge No. 15053, aka Kelsey Bragg, keeps an eye on a photographer in Cellblock 1B at the city jail's James A. Thomas Center. M - Tony Law Broadway and Houston Street A woman crossing Houston Street was hit by a car. After being administered to by paramedics, she walked away. M - Elisabeth Bumiller City Hall Elisabeth Bumiller, a reporter for The Times, covers Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The mayor's daily 8 a.m. staff meeting, in City Hall's Committee of the Whole Room, first used by Mayor DeWitt Clinton in 1812, is running late, the definition of any mayoral meeting of any century. The morning light coming in through the windows of the Federal-style room illuminates aides seated around a gleaming mahogany table, watching Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani listen to his commissioner of the administration for Children's Services, Nicholas Scoppetta. Scoppetta briefs Giuliani about a rally the mayor will attend for directors of the city's foster-care agencies. When Scoppetta mentions a judge who is expected to be there, the mayor, perhaps aware that his New York minute is not yet riveting, or maybe that he is not yet the central character, makes a move. ''Do I get my money for jury service?'' he breaks in, referring to his service as a juror days earlier in a personal-injury case. Scoppetta, absorbed in his presentation, at first takes no notice. ''And he,'' Scoppetta continues, ''he will bring--'' ''A check?'' offers the mayor, to laughter. ''A check,'' says Scoppetta jovially, catching on, just before the minute is over. M - Chang-rae Lee Le Monde gourmet Deli, 38 West 48th Street Chang-rae Lee is the author, most recently, of ''A Gesture Life,'' a novel. Seung-lae Lee, the proprietor, my cousin, presides over his short-order cooks cracking eggs onto the griddle, two by two. ''Pretty busy this morning,'' he says. And so it is. In this get-to-work rush, the customers line the length of the front counter, each waiting for their breakfast sandwich or bagel to be wrapped in foil and passed over the gleaming glass case. They stand, watching the action, with an uncommon New York patience, for they know it'll be just another minute. Behind the counter, the people-machine is running in high gear, the orders taken and called out, the responses barked back, the talk flying forth in Spanglish and English and Koreanese. Lee's wife is directing it all, shouting, ''Yo, amigo,'' and ''Yes, ma'am,'' and ''Coffee, coffee, ha-rha-buh-gee [grandpa in Korean]?'' her addresses wholly indiscriminate and sweet. Somehow, everyone understands. The two cashier girls ring it up, making change in their heads, their hands moving at the light-speed of a dollar being spent in Manhattan. This is not virtual commerce. Lee knows this, and takes a few overflow orders himself, relaying them to the griddle men, who shout it out, starting the business all over again. ''Not bad today,'' Lee says, surveying his buzzing empire. ''It's working.'' B - Edwidge Danticat Utica Avenue and Avenue D, East Flatbush Edwidge Danticat is the author of ''Breath, Eyes, Memory'' and, most recently, ''The Farming of Bones.'' Gray overcast minute in East Flatbush, a mostly African-American and Caribbean neighborhood. Landmark: Taste the Tropics Ice Cream, its parrot-green awning half covered with a swirling rainbow, linking three palmettos to a giant ice-cream cone. Car horns blare as ''dollar cab'' drivers race to get to the B46 bus stop to scoop up passengers before the bus arrives. For an even dollar each, the elderly caramel-skinned woman in a nursing uniform and the young boy in crisp navy pants, white long-sleeved shirt and a navy Catholic school tie will ride down Utica Avenue in a sleek leather-interior Lincoln Town Car and reach their destinations much faster. The Lincoln darts in and picks them up just in time, before the bus arrives. The co-owner of a new custom-upholstery shop, Austin wishes he could be somewhere else. ''In bed, maybe?'' Or perhaps on one of those trips advertised on yellow cardboard in the window of Astral Travel, across from Taste the Tropics. For $388, one can journey to Trinidad, Grenada or Haiti; a trip to Senegal, on this day of nines, is fittingly priced at $999. M - Susan Minot West Ninth Street Susan Minot is the author of ''Monkeys'' and, most recently, ''Evening.'' In the lobby, a fan is going on the battered desk. No doorman. A sign: ''They are working on the Elevator. Is out of order.'' I step outside. Down the street is the building that served as a model (built in a Hollywood studio) for ''Rear Window,'' Hitchcock's ode to voyeurism. No one this morning looks at one another. A stocky woman in a suit bustles toward the subway, rooting around for something in her bag; an Indian couple walks dreamily arm in arm; a woman with hair still wet holds her chin high. A man in a blue shirt tends his dog. The clock on the brick tower of the library, which used to be a courthouse, says 9:09. Walking toward me with a brisk pace is the shrink I used to see some years ago, someone who has peered in the window of many people's dramas and imbroglios and minutiae, mine included. She walks quickly by, not meeting my eye. 1,022,827 gallons of water and 7,890 megawatts of electricity flowed into New York City. 135,000 phone calls were placed or answered. M - Al Gibson, Mike Panarella and James Mennella 3 Times Square Fifty workers constructing the new Reuters Building on Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets were given disposable cameras to record the minute. Gibson and Panarella are crane operators on the project. Q - Leigh Holtzin the N Train, between Queensboro Plaza, Queens, and Lexington Avenue, Manhattan Q - Jan Staller Queens, construction of a new Water Tunnel M - Marilyn Church 100 Centre Street Judge Carol Edmead of Arraignment Court speaking with Michael Borba, the bridge officer who hands her the arraignments. M - Ken Kerbs New York Stock Exchange M - Grand and Forsyth Streets (left), broadway and wall street (right) Anthropology students from Barnard and Columbia collected garbage that was deposited in trash receptacles during the minute. M - James Traub The United Nations James Traub is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine. Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, left an elevator with his bodyguard and entered a television studio where he was scheduled to tape two messages -- one to ''the world business community,'' the other to employees of Unesco, a U.N. agency. Annan, who had been preoccupied for weeks with the conflict in East Timor, sat down before a mirror to be made up. He was as still as a mannequin, and he wore the muted uniform of the institution man: navy suit, white shirt, red and blue tie. Annan's white hair and goatee made his large, sleepy eyes look impossibly black. When an aide stuck his head through the curtain and said sorrowfully, ''There is a problem with the teleprompter, sir,'' Annan remained expressionless for a moment and then said softly: ''I'll do it another time. Now I can go talk to East Timor.'' B - Nicholas Dawidoff Yankee Stadium Nicholas Dawidoff is the author of ''The Catcher Was a Spy,'' a biography of Moe Berg, and ''In the Country of Country.'' Thomas Fyfe headed for the batter's box at Yankee Stadium. He carried a rake. Fyfe works as a groundskeeper at the most famous baseball field in America, and at 9:09 a.m. he stood alone on the vast green lawn surrounded by 57,746 empty seats, tamping and prodding the muddy clay around home plate. Pausing for a moment, Fyfe looked out across the dew-soaked outfield and noticed things only a groundskeeper sees. In right field, a sea-gull feather lay on a tired stretch of sod that Fyfe refers to as ''O'Neill's spot'' -- a patch of grass the outfielder Paul O'Neill wears down with his vigorous pacing between pitches. An open gate in left-center revealed two tomatoes heavy on the vine in the bullpen garden. In shallow-left, near the stands, were two ballpoint pens, misplaced, Fyfe thought, by fans hoping to receive an autograph. ''Now's the best time in the world,'' he said. ''There's nobody here. You just come out and work.'' M - Cathleen Schine 76th and West End Avenue Cathleen Schine is the author, most recently, of ''The Evolution of Jane.'' In ''The Pursuit of the Millennium,'' the historian Norman Cohn illustrates the five ways in which medieval millennialists identified salvation. 1. It will be collective. We're here, together, waiting for the same thing. . . . 2. It will be realized on this earth. Grinding din of workmen digging up street, heaviness of humidity. . . . 3. It is imminent. Man on cell phone, hand held out with casual certainty. . . . Two women, both in black suits, competitors, eye each other, ready to pounce. . . . 4. It will be total -- utterly transforming life. An undeniable truth in heavy rain. Or when it's freezing and you're not properly dressed. Or when you're late. Like increasingly frantic father with son's backpack. Mother, with squirming daughter, waving wildly. . . . 5. Finally, it will be miraculous. Yes. Only one of blind mystical faith like the man with the cell phone, hand still out, can really expect one now. The others peer irritably into the distance. Lights atop yellow cabs unlighted -- inauspicious. But then. . . . A golden gypsy slows, sparkles beside the believer, blinks its headlights. . . . Just one. . . . The left. . . . It's a sign! It's a taxi. M - Eleanor Randolph Astor Place Eleanor Randolph is a member of the editorial board of The Times. Jerry DeLakas stands alone in his compact green newsstand, surrounded by a panorama of urgent headlines. ''Virus Scare Grows'' shouts Page 1 of The Daily News -- mosquitoes have caused an outbreak of ''encephalitis,'' three deaths in a city of seven million people. Newsday features a postman with bug spray in his mailbag. The stand is oddly quiet. DeLakas smokes, a hazard made worse by his habit of storing his burning cigarette in the middle of a stack of magazines while he makes a sale. Suddenly a man in overalls rushes up, pays for a copy of the Spanish daily El Diario and then begins running back to the street. ''My truck stop there,'' he points to the reason for his urgency. ''No make me get ticket,'' he calls over his shoulder. With 10 seconds left in the minute, a lean man darts into the newsstand, grabs The New York Times, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal and leaves a small wad of bills. Engrossed in his cell phone, he waves off the change, a far bigger deal clearly hanging in the balance. Only once does he slow down -- to explain to me that he cannot stop. A sampling of the books returned to the Brooklyn Public Library in Grand Army Plaza: E.B. White, ''Charlotte's Web''; James Herbert, ''Portent''; David Eddings, ''Sorceress of Darshiva: Book Four of the Malloreon''; Amanda Quick, ''Reckless''; Wanda Ga'g, ''Millions of Cats.'' M - Alex Witchel Grand Central Terminal Alex Witchel reports on style for The Times. Her flowered skirt sways above her ankles, like curtains in a breeze. She makes her way intently around the circular beacon that is the Information Booth in Grand Central Terminal, oblivious to the streams of men charging off the escalators, wielding briefcases big and battered. She walks first past the red schedules, the green, then the blue, selecting one of each -- Westport, Greenwich, Tuckahoe -- as if she were choosing fruit. She passes through the line of harried questioners (''Can you tell me how to go to Metuchen, N.J.?'') and drifts past the man who sets his coffee cup on the shelf holding the schedules, knocking some to the floor, where they lie, ignored. Her journey complete, she files her stack carefully in her black shoulder bag. Knowing now how to get to every New York suburb at every hour of the day, she turns her back and heads toward the subway. B - Charles Siebert Brooklyn Bridge Charles Siebert is the author of the forthcoming ''Angus,'' a memoir of a dying dog. At the top of the Brooklyn anchorage ramp, a well-heeled woman stops to wrestle a homeless man over the trash can he has just spilled onto the promenade, thrashes him with her briefcase, picks up scattered newspapers and puts them back in the container as he canes his way toward the next one. Nearly 10 minutes gone of the official workday, these are the late crossers. No eased faces in the mounting heat, all grimace and climb, traffic so dense you worry for its destination, start counting the city's vertical panes against the passing eyes and windshields here, some incalculable yet daily resolved equation between the onslaught and the eventual settle. The sun slides into view. From unseen roadway scaffoldings below, jackhammers and lug wrench whines, the nuts and bolts, the underpinnings of flight being tended to. M - Joan Liftin Washington Square Park B - Erin Patrice O'Brien Beth Jacob School, Boro Park, Brooklyn M - James Mennella 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue M - Timothy (Speed) Levitch Sixth Avenue and Eighth Street M - Benjamin H. Lee Washington Street, off 14th Street B - Alex Tehrani Third Avenue and 149th street, The Bronx B - Brenda Ann Kenneally Broadway and Kosciuszko Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn M - Amanda Hesser Wall and Water Streets M - Arlene Gottfried Sixth Avenue and 12th Street M - David Shipley Greenwich Avenue and 10th Street B - John Berendt Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn John Berendt is the author of ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.'' Except for the distant drone of a lawn mower and the higher-pitched whapping sound of an edge trimmer somewhere out of sight, all is stillness on this grassy hilltop in New York's ''Garden City of the Dead.'' In the shadow of an imposing bronze statue of Minerva, Charles Higgins, the inventor of India ink, slumbers in a heavy, banklike mausoleum. Some yards behind him, the remains of the musician Leonard Bernstein lie under a simple marker set flush into the ground. Five small stones have been placed on it. Half a million people are buried in this cemetery, and five more are lowered into it every day. They tell me that 135 groundskeepers maintain these 478 lush acres, but all I know is not a single living soul came into view during the minute I stood watch. Esmeralda Santiago Southbound tollbooth plaza, Henry Hudson Bridge Esmeralda Santiago is the author of ''When I Was Puerto Rican'' and, most recently, ''Almost a Woman.'' A Dodge Intrepid cuts in front of a Lexus. The Lexus driver curses and gives the finger to the Intrepid, which then weaves in front of an Eclipse. An Explorer sidles up to a Beetle, hovers next to it until its driver notices, then signals right. A Navigator balks between the Cash Only and E-ZPass lanes, blocking everyone behind. A Pathfinder noses the Navigator, which stops dead in its tracks. A yellow cab takes advantage of the Navigator's hesitation and guns in front of it, followed by a Caravan. An Expedition tries to make the same move, but the Navigator lurches forward, heading, finally, triumphantly, for the E-ZPass. One arrival at Newark International Airport (US Airways Flight 1122, from Pittsburgh) and one departure (Continental Flight 1083, to West Palm Beach, Fla.). One departure at La Guardia (United Airlines Flight 347, to Denver). No arrivals or departures at John F. Kennedy International. B - Harvey Shapiro Brooklyn Promenade Harvey Shapiro is the author, most recently, of ''Selected Poems.'' There they are the water-hugging giants of Manhattan breathing the dun-colored air of morning. Silent, mysterious seen through a white scrim of fog. Directly beneath me, commuter traffic of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Across that, on the Brooklyn docks one lone forklift tractor, loaded with steel rods, jockeying back and forth before the Strober Bros. Building Supply Depot. Across the water, dimly descried, nested in the green arches of Battery, a perky yellow Staten Island Ferry. But the buildings pulsing in their various shades of white and now, as the fog thins slowly, a pale dusty blue, out of Giotto, seems to descend behind them. These mighty presences at the end of Manhattan Island, fronting the East River that is not a river but a tidal strait carrying the North Atlantic to our very doorstep. These monuments that dominate our day as if they had been fixed there forever though they are in flux as the waters are in flux. They stand before us like tribal gods meting out success and unsuccess, all that we have to lift our eyes to. M - Pete Hamill Broadway and Canal Street Pete Hamill, former editor of The Daily News, is the author, most recently, of an illustrated biography of Diego Rivera. At 9:09, the street light changes and trucks roar into life along Canal, crossing Broadway, heading east to the Manhattan Bridge, west to the Holland Tunnel: gru, gru, grug, gu-grug, groooaaaaar. Pedestrians rush across Broadway: two Chinese girls in high heels speaking English; a tan woman with a dragon tattooed on her bare back, sipping coffee as she walks; a fat guy in a Ralph Lauren shirt hurrying across on dainty feet right behind four students with backpacks and baggy jeans. All easing past one another, avoiding collisions, hurrying. A young Latina woman, copper-haired in the morning sun, wearing a tailored tan suit and carrying a briefcase, strides through the jumbled crowd, cutting a path. A large woman in a blue dress pauses to light a cigarette, her face desperate and sweaty, while others move around her. A tiny gray-haired Chinese woman in slacks and blouse, carrying a heavy shopping bag, hurries along, as the light turns to DONT WALK and a Bell Atlantic truck makes an abrupt turn out of Canal, heading directly at her. She freezes in the truck's path. The driver stops, gives her a small wave; she nods and waves back and hurries on, into her American morning. M - Jack Pierson Churchill Park, Bleecker and Downing Streets B - Yvette M. Sohl Central Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn M - Nina Berman Central Park West and 81st Street Madeline Greenberg, in her apartment, gets some help from her nurse, Judy Dennis. B - Angel Franco Viele and Tiffany Avenues, Hunts Point, The South Bronx Roxxanne, a 27-year-old prostitute, in front of the lot where she lives. Originally from Maine, she came to New York 12 years ago. M - Carrie Boretz P.S. 165, West 109th Street Genesis Frias is not at all happy about returning to school. Struggling all the way, she is led into her first day of second grade. M - Julia Topolski West Ninth Street, between Broadway and University Place M - Lewis Lapham The Carlyle Hotel dining room, Madison Avenue at 76th Street Lewis Lapham is the editor of Harper's Magazine and the author, most recently, of ''Lapham's Rules of Influence.'' A high-ceilinged room decorated with the reassuring signs of serious money: English hunting scenes by Fores on walls faced with brown velvet, fresh flowers (Casablanca lilies and curly willow) against a background of old botany (the engravings by Redoute), the pattern of the breakfast china matched to the chintz on the center banquette, the coffee priced at $5, the poached eggs on smoked salmon at $22.50. The 28 tables accommodate a tasteful selection of fine guests, as reassuring as the decor in their dress and appearance: custom-made shirts, German accents, warm suntans lately arrived from Cape Cod and California, a small but important collection of gold jewelry. The two men rising from the table near the door -- Robert Rubin, recently resigned as the secretary of the Treasury, and Richard Holbrooke, newly confirmed as the ambassador to the United Nations -- gather their papers and close their briefcases. They nod to people in remote corners of the room, and as they walk out into the lobby, the matre d'htel bows to them with a grateful smile, acknowledging their fitness to be seen in the company of horses by Fores, watches from Breguet, the lily by Redoute. Frank McCourt 345 East 15th Street Frank McCourt is the author, most recently, of '''Tis.'' It is the first day of the academic year for the High School for Health Professions and Human Services. This is where I used to teach, from 1969 to 1987, back when Stuyvesant High School was in this building. Students crowd the sidewalks between First and Second Avenues. They sit on the steps of the old brownstones opposite their school. They also lean against cars, triggering alarms, which they then imitate. They laugh till security guards or other adults from the school ask them to please stay off the cars. The students are polite, but when the adults go back into the building, they relax against the cars again. Along the street, there are reunions, cries and hugs. Hi, Joey. Hi, Miranda. Wow, you lost weight. Love your hair. The student population seems to be largely African-American, with smaller groups of Hispanics and Asians and an even smaller group of whites. When I taught here, the population was mostly Jewish, though as the years went on it became increasingly Asian. The school bell rings, and the boxes, bags and bottles containing foods and drinks must be disposed of. Adults from the school ask the students to please pick up their garbage and put it in the can, but there is litter and the school year has begun. Zero births and deaths reported in New York City. 7,420,166 estimated population. S - Bastienne Schmidt New Brighton, Staten Island It's breakfast time for Philippe Cheng and his 6-month-old son, Max. M - Garry Trudeau Fifth Avenue and 84th Street The Alignment of The Heavens www.astrology.net B - Deborah Mesa-Pelly Remsen Street, Brooklyn Heights B - Phillip Lopate Carroll Park, Brooklyn Phillip Lopate is the editor of ''The Art of the Essay,'' an annual anthology. Four hefty Italian-American moms sit around the picnic benches, drinking iced espressos while their kids dash around. A father, middle-aged like me (Oh, the sticky solicitous doting of graybeard dads!), tenderly picks up his boy to take him to the bathroom in the dignified stone park house. Another father lifts his tan-frocked daughter up to grab the parallel bars, then says, ''Play with something else,'' and heads for a bench. He's teaching her ''independence,'' meanwhile grabbing a few private moments. She skulks over the standard-issue climbing structure, probably thinking, Why do adults insist on pretending it's fun to play by yourself? This park is the glue that holds our (suddenly trendy) neighborhood together, the one public space that equalizes newcomers and old-timers, haves and have-nots. In their corner, black nannies with white babies discuss in island accents the chances of finding other employment. Across, a woman trains her son to take toddler steps, while absent-mindedly picking lint from her yellow blouse. A huge-bellied man snoozes on a bench, his shopping cart filled with collected bottles. Excerpts from the Dow Jones news ticker, Times Square: TOKYO STOCKS CLOSE 0.2% HIGHER AFTER JAPAN'S G.D.P.

Homes Crunch gym, 404 Lafayette Street A.M. Homes is the author of ''Music for Torching,''a novel. In front of me are hindquarters -- three women on StairMasters, pushing to the top. To my left, a famous foreign correspondent, on a Precor EFX544 Crosstrainer. He reads papers damp with sweat, turning the pages and then shedding them to the floor, leaving a pile of news all around him. On the treadmill next to me, a gray-haired guy, cell phone clipped to his shorts. He runs at 5.8 m.p.h., panting. His phone rings. ''I don't know,'' he barks. ''I don't know anything.'' At the juice bar, someone orders a Chocolate Monkey with soy protein. Overhead hangs a bank of TV's, close-captioned for the hearing impaired. On the exercise channel, a group of 20 does tricep exercises in unison. The CNBC ticker tape flows while Martha Stewart's mother suggests adding pineapple to the rice pudding; Martha, justifiably suspicious, offers that maybe raisins would be more traditional. A commercial for Final Fantasy IV flashes across the screen, and the gray-haired guy is ringing again. ''Are we winning?'' he asks, splashing sweat onto my controls. ''That's all I want to know, are we winning?'' M - Darcy Frey WEST 72nd Street Darcy Frey is the author of ''The Last Shot.'' Location: Small, well-appointed office, decorated with sprawling vines and South American artifacts, in an apartment building. Two men face each other in leather armchairs. On an ottoman between them sits a tape recorder. Patient: Last night, I had all sorts of performance-anxiety dreams. Analyst: Such as? Patient: Well, I dreamt I was in some sort of stage production and I couldn't remember any of my lines. Analyst: Yes? Patient: And the woman I was doing the scene with, she couldn't remember any of her lines, either. [Through the open window comes the squeal of truck brakes.] To be honest, I think it's about my doubts and anxieties about being in therapy. Analyst: Let's stay with the dream for a moment. Where does the dream take place? Patient: I can't remember. Analyst: And the woman -- who was she? [The piercing cry of a car alarm is heard.] Patient: I can't remember. Analyst: Well, what did she look like? Patient: I can't remember. Analyst: Well, was she someone you were romantically involved with? [A jackhammer starts up. Analyst and patient raise their voices.] Patient: No, she was someone I'd been paired with artificially. Analyst: And why do you think this is about therapy? Patient: Well, talk about an artificial situation! M - Michael Pollan Central Park Michael Pollan is a contributing writer for the magazine. ''It's hideous out there,'' warned the radio. ''Hazy, hot and humid'' was the forecast, and by 9:09 it was already all of that. But hideous? Not where I was. Where I was was on the terrace of Belvedere Castle, the rough midpoint and actual high point of Central Park, and the precise spot where New York City's weather is measured by an ensemble of meteorological instruments. At 9:09, the official readings were as follows: temperature, 24 C; dew point, 22 C; relative humidity, 87 percent; visibility, 1 1/2 miles in mist; barometric pressure, 29.87. Here are some other, unofficial readings as of 9:09, collected by five different instruments temporarily installed at the same location: Eyes: Looking north over the Great Lawn, a milky haze hangs in the trees, throwing the blocky crenelations edging the park slightly out of focus. The effect is like standing at the bottom of a large white teacup, the haze curving up the sides to an indistinct rim circling above; only directly overhead is the pale blue of the sky visible. Below, five mallards moving east etch overlapping V's in the green pane of Turtle Pond. Eight turtles nap on a narrow ledge of schist, all presenting themselves to the sun at precisely the same angle. Across the pond, six stagehands are striking the set at the Delacorte Theater. A woman in a Sullivan & Cromwell T-shirt Rollerblades along the perimeter of the Great Lawn, which is being mowed. A belated wisteria bloom, one of summer's (and millennium's) last, hangs in the crown of a cherry tree. Skin: Right cheek registers an intense circle of radiant heat originating at the 2 o'clock position in the eastern sky. Tongue: Tang of salt, from the perspiration beading upper lip. Ears: The drone of traffic across the 79th Street transverse, steady as an air-conditioner until broken by the diesel laboring of a crosstown bus. A jet rising from La Guardia slowly churns the air, then fades, opening a parenthesis for the warble of a bird. Echo-y hammer taps rise from the stagehands, who have switched on a boom box or radio: jazz. Nose: The moist, unmoving air holds each smell in a kind of suspension. There is cut grass; there is decadent pond; there is dumpster; there is hot-dog steam. M - Jhumpa Lahiri Cooper Station Post Office, Fourth Avenue and 11th Street Jhumpa Lahiri is the author of ''Interpreter of Maladies,'' a collection of short stories. A man affixes 33-cent stamps to a pile of purple envelopes. The envelopes are stiff, full of promise, elegantly addressed in bold black strokes. The stamps, self-adhesive, have pink roses on them. The man wears a plaid shirt, khaki shorts, brown shoes and black socks pulled up to his calves. He stands at a table, covered with pale green glass, supported by golden columns. A brass plate runs down the center of the table, with empty round receptacles where there once may have been sponges for moistening stamps. Voices echo in the post office. Heels clip across the floor. The man works solemnly, methodically, about to see a long project to its end. Above his head, a digital clock.Time is running out to the year 2000,'' the clock's backing says: 113 days, 14 hours, 50 minutes, a few seconds to go. M - Gosia Wieruszewska 158th Street and Broadway M - Four Seasons Restaurant East 52nd Street The reservation list for the day's power lunches to come. M - Scott Thode 125th Street and Lexington Avenue A construction site turned community bulletin board. M - Michael Hsu 35 Pell Street John Hung: This is my business, the May May Company, and we're making right now a baked pork bun -- a sweet roll filled with the barbecued pork and oyster gravy. I would imagine 1,000 years from now it'll be automatic, making the dough and getting the fillings ready. Everything will be the same size, same way, identical. Handmade you can tell the difference: some are rounder; some are fatter; some have a little more filling. Anything done by machine has no feeling. Public Radio's Sound Portraits Productions (David Isay, Stacy Abramson and Meagan Howell) sent reporters out to record the minute in eight places around the city. Here are excerpts; more recordings can be heard at www.nytimes.com/nyminute. M - Richard Sandler Jones Diner, 371 Lafayette Street The Rev. Billy, left, sidewalk preacher: A thousand years from now we will not be measuring our lives by our time-distance from the birth of one Jesus Christ. We will be measuring our time from the birth of Mr. Mickey Mouse. Mickey is the most famous corporate logo in the world, and his power over us is accelerating at the present time. We must resist this. How do we do that? Right now we don't have a clear strategy. Right now, Mickey Mouse and his handlers are in the ascendancy. . . . I have a vision . . . of erasing Mickey Mouse's face. Nothing is left of it. Times Square again becomes a place where the sidewalks are populated by real people! Visionaries. Sex workers. Blarney Stone experiencers. People sagging in the doorways. Hallelujah. That's the future! Amen! Praise be! I'm going to get back to my Western omelet right now. Nice to talk to you. M - Beth Fertig Manhattan Criminal Court Mr. Black [he wouldn't give full name]: Nineteen-ninety-nine is the beginning of the end. Everything is getting worse. Anyone selling drugs gets football number -- 55 years, lifetime sentences. Cocaine or weed. I'm here for selling weed, they say. I didn't put a gun to anyone's head. I'm just trying to feed my kids. M - Verlyn Klinkenborg 38th Street and Sixth Avenue Verlyn Klinkenborg writes editorials for The Times. He is the author of ''Making Hay'' and ''The Last Fine Time.'' What does this lot lack that makes it ''vacant''? Tenants larger than the 13 pigeons resting there. Foliage more ornamental than the low weeds growing in a solid mat near the 38th Street sidewalk. Dwellings more substantial than the construction trailer parked beside a sign announcing ''Another Gotham Construction Project.'' Commerce more consequential than the sticker pasted to a fence post advertising a Millennium Marijuana March in May 2000. Will the march take place? Will construction begin? Will the pigeons fly? Nothing happens here except time and the roosting of pigeons. And yet the sound of the street -- an overcast roar -- is subtly changed by the cubic absence, the nearly inaudible silence this vacant lot offers the city.

VOne early March night in Boston, while on tour promoting a novel I'd recently published, I gave a reading at a theater across the street from the Coolidge Corner bookstore where in 1961 I was briefly employed, most unhappily, as a shipping clerk consigned to the basement. The theater was filled to overflowing, and the occasion was for me, these many years later, a grand occasion, a triumphant homecoming. I told this to the audience before the reading, perhaps to personalize the by now nearly rote recitation, but more likely merely to flatter myself. Back in the winter of 1961, I said, I was a 21-year-old dropout, a kid with little more than a fantasy that he was a writer, living in the Back Bay demimonde among poets and hustlers, artists and drug addicts, musicians and con men. I was literary, but not very literate, a late-arriving beatnik with a taste mainly for getting wasted.

In the course of the book Ms. Sheehy ends up sounding a lot like Dr. Joyce Brothers while her subject comes across as an Oprah guest: a woman who loves too much and plays Wendy to her husband's Peter Pan.

VEUROPE VATICAN: IRAQ CALLS OFF PAPAL VISIT -- In a major setback to Pope John Paul II's plans for the millennium, the Vatican said a visit to the city of Ur, believed to be Abraham's birthplace, had been called off by Iraq. The Vatican could not reach an agreement over a visit that the Pope, 79, viewed as a pilgrimage but that was fraught with political overtones for Saddam Hussein, and also for Washington. The United States lobbied against the visit, fearing that it could lend legitimacy to the Iraqi government. Alessandra Stanley (NYT) ITALY: RAMP WORK TO CONTINUE -- Overriding concerns that archeological ruins could be destroyed, the government announced that it would go ahead with a ramp to a Vatican parking lot that was halted after workers stumbled on ancient Roman frescoes. The ramp is not expected to be finished in time for Vatican millennium celebrations on Christmas Eve. City officials say it may be ready for Easter. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)

VFor parents like Mitchell and Jill Friedman of Great Neck, N.Y., the decision to enroll a child in a wilderness program for troubled teenagers is born of desperation, a last chance to rescue a life endangered by drugs, crime or simply aimlessness. In the Friedmans' case, the outcome was worth the anguish. ''It's wonderful -- I'm crying,'' Mr. Friedman said today at the graduation of his son, Jeffrey, from the Redcliff Ascent Outdoor Therapy Program. ''The last year has been hell. Every day he was out of school, on the streets, somewhere, we were terrified. When we got him here, we finally breathed easier.''

His parents, white supremacists who despised the federal government, took him out of school and urged him to become a white warrior instead. He objected, but not for long. By the age of 24, Mr. Kehoe was one of the most notorious white supremacists in the United States, having engaged in a kidnapping, three robberies, three murders and two police shootouts, all in a quest to establish an Aryan republic for white people.

VRoosevelt Douglas leaned back in a soft couch last Friday morning, placed his glasses on his oval, two-tier coffee table and reflected a bit ruefully on his life, like a talented athlete looking back on a disappointing career. Mr. Douglas, 58, contracted H.I.V. sometime around 1985, but only this year has it begun to take a serious toll physically. He was hospitalized last month for an inflamed colon. He is too weak to operate his jewelry vending stand and now spends most of his day watching television in his cozy sixth-floor apartment.

VIt once seemed that the word ''failure'' was not a part of Bill Bradley's lexicon. He had been a Rhodes scholar, an Olympic gold medalist, a two-time N.B.A. champion and, on his first foray into politics in 1978, the winner of a Senate seat from New Jersey. In 1984, during the Reagan landslide, he won re-election in a walk. So in 1990, when Mr. Bradley came within three percentage points of losing his once-safe bastion to an unknown, poorly financed Republican named Christine Todd Whitman, he was devastated. For weeks, he wandered the state in a sullen funk, asking friends what had gone wrong. Over coffee, Michael J. Breslin, a Hackensack lawyer, summed it up for him in one word.

p44573
VSpecial report, Looking Back, on emergence of Bill Bradley as Democratic presidential contender after stint in US Senate and after political career almost ended in 1990, when he barely defeated little known Republican challenger Christine Todd Whitman for re-election to Senate from New Jersey; to many critics and supporters alike, Bradley's disastrous 1990 campaign is most important event of his political life, since it shook his confidence, caused intense bout of introspection and has since colored his view of politics; Bradley says near failure has helped him understand importance of listening more directly to voters, of speaking from his heart and not worrying about advice of handlers and of being bold; says he has incorporated lessons into current presidential campaign, in which he has campaigned against conventional politics and made campaign finance reform central issue; photo (M)

The court was scheduled to issue a verdict in the case, but instead annulled the proceedings. Mrs. Tiberi was said to have accepted nearly $36,000 for writing a 36-page report on a subject about which she had no expertise. Suzanne Daley (NYT)

VDisplaying a calm persistence and aggressiveness, former Senator Bill Bradley tried to poke holes tonight in Vice President Al Gore's health care, education and gun control proposals in their second televised encounter. Mr. Gore, in turn, questioned his rival's commitment to education, health care and managing the economy. Nearly two months after the first debate, when he declined to engage Mr. Gore, Mr. Bradley tried a strikingly different approach in their 90-minute encounter at Daniel Webster College here, which was televised tonight on the ABC News program ''Nightline.''

VAfter receding modestly for two years, the use of marijuana and other illicit drugs by American adolescents remained largely unchanged in 1999, according to the latest findings in an annual national study that is the leading barometer of teenage substance abuse. The White House director of national drug policy, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, said the study was encouraging because it confirmed that a resurgence in drug use since 1992 had been reversed.

VLetting Londoners choose their own chief executive would strike most people as a long overdue exercise. But the campaign for the first directly elected mayor of this city of eight million residents has caught British politicians ill-prepared, with embarrassing consequences all around. Selection of the Conservative and Labor nominees for the election in May has been delayed until next month, and the contest for an office that will have a larger popular mandate than any other in Britain has become the stuff of soap opera, with the sex scandal resignation of one candidate and the barring of another for his confessed serial adultery.

VHere is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone, especially during the holiday season when many galleries close for longer periods. Also, some museums are closed Christmas Day. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show. Museums ''THE AMERICAN CENTURY: ART AND CULTURE, PART 2: 1950-2000,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 13). Filling the museum's six floors, this complicated, conflicted exhibition once more demonstrates the difficulty of mounting sweepingly inclusive exhibitions with no discernible point of view. It displays hundreds of works in dozens of mediums expertly placed in contexts that constantly pull one's attention outward, toward the show's flickering edges: landmark events, famous personalities, banned or controversial books, emblematic snippets of film, song and television and even the ephemeral. But these do not disguise a discouragingly conventional core and the predictable, severely truncated story told by the objects on view. The many great works in the show's first half tend to be overly familiar because they are mostly drawn from the museum's collection. Moving toward the present, the works become weaker, the choices of artists arbitrary, the sense of history increasingly confused and the absence of non-American artists more and more glaring. Ultimately one senses not an ''American Century'' or even half-century but two decades, the 1950's and 60's, during which American art -- seen in isolation -- held its ground. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Closed Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Roberta Smith). * ''THE ARTIST AS COLLECTOR: MASTERPIECES FROM THE C. C. WANG FAMILY COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 9). The painter and collector C. C. Wang, now 92, has amassed one of the world's premier private collections of Chinese old master paintings. This show gives some idea of the treasures he has sold and those he still holds. Included are 60 pieces in the Met's permanent holdings, along with 12 recent arrivals and loans from Mr. Wang. Much of the material is familiar; this is basically a rotation of the museum's permanent collection, with additions. But much is not, and the total impact is impressive. Especially interesting in a show based on the theme of connoisseurship is the presence, front and center, of a colossal scroll that arrived at the Met two years ago as an exceedingly rare 10th-century work but that a prominent art historian has called a 20th-century forgery. The Met is convinced it has the genuine article and offers substantial evidence. Judge for yourself. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Closed Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Suggested admission: $10 for adults; $5 for students and the elderly (Holland Cotter). * ''BERLIN METROPOLIS: JEWS AND THE NEW CULTURE, 1890-1918,'' Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through April 23). A show that should be a required course in every New Yorker's education: our cosmopolitan tradition, our appetite for novelty and change spring partly from seeds planted a century ago in Berlin. Though it highlights the part played by Jews, the story it tells could be the story of all outsiders who gravitate toward cities in search of meaning. With more than 200 paintings, stage designs, sheet-music covers, gallery catalogs, photographs, sculptures and other objects, it covers the years when modernism took root: in galleries, publishing houses and theaters, in advanced art from France and Italy, in the rich street life of newspapers, cafes and shop windows. Given the revolutionary temper of the art, the presentation is surprisingly understated, and this adds enormously to the show's power. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Tuesdays until 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and the elderly (Herbert Muschamp). * ''A CENTURY OF DESIGN, PART I: 1900-1925,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, (through March 26). This exquisite sampling of 20th-century design objects from the Met's own collection covers the years 1900-1925 and the three major design currents of the period: Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau and Art Deco. More than 50 examples of furniture, metalwork, glass, ceramics, textiles, jewelry and drawings are on view, from a fanciful Pompeian-style dressing table of bronze and basalt by the French designer Armand-Albert Rateau to a silver claret jug with sinuous curves and flyaway thumbpiece, the work of the English craftsman Archibald Knox. The show, more a salute than a full-scale survey, is the first of four, extending well into 2001, that will cover the entire 20th century. Installed in several intimate galleries of the 20th-century department, it proves once again that the Met can mount a boutique show with as much panache as a five-alarm blockbuster. Hours and admission: See above (Grace Glueck). * ''BODY ART: MARKS OF IDENTITY,'' American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100 (through May 29). The theme of this smart, entertaining, globe-spanning show is personal adornment of the most intimate kind, including tattooing, piercing and scarification. The packed installation offers just enough bare multicultural flesh to inspire rubbernecking without actually being an adults-only affair. Most interesting is the way art and anthropology are seamlessly brought together. Greek vases and African hairpins, ethnic postcards and Indian miniatures, Victorian corsets, Amazonian nose plugs and contemporary neo-tribal body work from New York share the limelight. It all makes fascinating sense, and a family-style museum gets to looks sexy in the bargain. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 8:45 p.m. Closed Christmas Day. Admission: $8; $6, students and the elderly; $4.50, children (Cotter). * ''CELEBRATING THE AMERICAN WING,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, (212) 535-7710 (works on paper through March 26; other acquisitions through Nov. 12, 2000). The 75th anniversary of the American Wing, the first permanent installation of early American decorative arts and architecture in an American museum, is commemorated with an extensive show of five-star acquisitions made since 1980. (That was the year the wing got a makeover and expansion.) Paintings, drawings, sculptures, textiles, furniture, ceramics, period rooms and things more difficult to classify come within the wing's capacious reach, and its newer prizes, shown in context with older works in the collection, include a dazzling 19th-century quilt incorporating world-famous signatures, a lively early watercolor by Winslow Homer of two small boys with a hoard of clams, a fine group of miniature paintings on ivory, a pair of lavishly gilded card tables by the early-19th-century cabinetmaker Charles-Honore Lannuier and a Colt revolver with gold inlaid scrollwork and a bust of George Washington set into the cylinder. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck). ''CLEMENTE,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3800 (through Jan. 12). The youngest artist to be given the full-rotunda treatment, the Italian neo-Expressionist Francesco Clemente has filled the place with a large (maybe too large), unruly multimedia survey. Full of dreamy East-meets-West images that delve into the mind, the body and many forms of love, the show reveals him to be a 1980's star for the 90's. His receptive, anything-goes sensibility and constant movement among New York, India and Italy have resulted in an astounding range of style, media and working processes. The more than 400 works on view include Expressionist oils and dreamy pastels, pale frescos and taut, Indian-style miniatures and works involving handmade paper, the best of which are influenced by Indian movie posters. The nonchronological order of the exhibition obscures any sense of Mr. Clemente's emblematic development out of late 70's Conceptual Art and disguises the fact that his best work was done in the early 80's, when neo-Expressionism was in its feverish heyday. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, until 8 p.m. Closed Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Admission: $12; $7 for students and the elderly (Smith). ''DOUBLE VISION: STAN DOUGLAS AND DOUGLAS GORDON,'' Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through March 4). This exhibition juxtaposes two video projection pieces in which juxtaposition is all, and the technical explanation is almost more interesting than the work itself. Mr. Gordon divides the frames of ''Whirlpool,'' a film noir directed by Otto Preminger, between two reels, converts them to video and projects them side by side, with the right-hand projection reversed. The result is a strobelike pulsing of sound and image and a fantastic formal array of symmetrical patterns, sliding planes and kaleidoscopic motion, with plot reduced to a sideshow pantomime. In ''Win, Place or Show,'' Mr. Douglas has filmed and refilmed a six-minute exchange of words and then blows between two men who share a modernistic apartment in a big anonymous complex, shooting it from different angles, with slight changes in dialogue, props and blocking. Projecting double images of the same scene shot from different angles, he creates a disjunction so peculiar and confusing that the viewer, struggling to keep track of the changes, becomes an instant deconstructionist, parsing the scene word by word and move by move until the whole thing threatens to disintegrate. Both pieces are tours de force of a very cerebral kind. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Closed Christmas Eve Day and Christmas Day, New Year's Eve Day and New Year's Day. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Smith). * ''EGYPTIAN ART IN THE AGE OF THE PYRAMIDS,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 9). Getting the early vote for blockbuster of the fall season, this is one of those spectacles, like the Byzantine, Chinese and Mexican surveys the Met has done in recent years, that are not only about art but also a whole civilization. It examines the 500 years between 2650 B.C. and 2150 B.C., the period of the Old Kingdom. Considering the number and popularity of exhibitions about New Kingdom pharaohs like Tutankhamen and Amenhotep III, it is a little surprising that this is the first big survey devoted to what is really the high point of all ancient Egyptian culture. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman). * ''EASTMAN JOHNSON: PAINTING AMERICA,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Feb. 6). If he wasn't the most exciting painter, Johnson (1824-1906) was a solid one, whose mix of corny stereotype and original observation was heavily influenced by 17th-century Dutch genre painting. His narrative focus encompassed rural and domestic life, women, children and old men, and a group of important African-American subjects. Although his name is now overshadowed by Winslow Homer and Thomas Eakins, for two decades (1860-1880) he was the leading figure painter in the United States. His boldest endeavor before and during the Civil War was painting antislavery scenes, like the powerful ''Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves'' (circa 1862). After the war he became noted for his domestic interiors and scenes of rural life. This show is a worthy tribute to an artist who fused home-grown talent with European training to convey a well-varnished vision of 19th-century America. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Closed Christmas Day; open New Year's Day from 5 to 11 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students; $1.50 for the elderly (Glueck). ''MODERN STARTS: PEOPLE, PLACES AND THINGS,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (''People'' through Feb. 1; the rest, March 14). The first of the Modern's millennial museumwide extravaganzas, this flawed, courageous and unprecedented exhibition is a sweeping but episodic view of the inexorable drift toward the modern that began in the mid-19th century. It organizes more than 600 works from the museum's vaunted collection every which way but chronological: by medium, subject, geography, artistic strategy and so on. The results are confusing, unwieldy, jarringly arbitrary in some areas, tediously repetitious in others and appallingly short on female artists. There are some exciting departures: a small gallery comparing the satiric, death-haunted prints of James Ensor and Jose Guadalupe Posada, a ravishing if more predictable homage to French landscape and a persistent attention to photography. Picasso's ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' is installed as if it were just another great painting, not the first instance of nuclear fission. ''Things'' looks the best because it mixes its media the most thoroughly. But if the drummer is different, many of the marchers remain the same: Cezanne, Picasso and Matisse appear throughout, and nearly all paintings are French. The speculative nature of the show is refreshing, but its ideas are almost never pushed far enough. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays and on Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Holiday hours: 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. this Wednesday. Closed Christmas Day; open New Year's Day from 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50 for students and the elderly (Smith). * ''ONLY THE BEST: MASTERPIECES OF THE CALOUSTE GULBENKIAN MUSEUM, LISBON,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 82nd Street at Fifth Avenue, (212) 879-5500 (through Feb. 27). A Turkish-born Armenian oil millionaire who spent most of his adult life in Europe, Gulbenkian (1869-1955) was as eclectic in his aesthetic tastes as he was focused on quality. He bought, he scrutinized, he de-accessioned: ending up with one of the century's greatest collections, 80 of whose 5,000 objects are in this show. Organized in alternating groups of fine and decorative arts, it nearly covers the cultural glove, with mostly outstanding examples. The decorative holdings include Turkish and Islamic ceramics and textiles, jaw-dropping examples of 18th-century French silver and a selection of jewelry by Rene Lalique. Alternating with these are Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities, medieval and Renaissance paintings, including a stunning portrait of a young woman by Ghirlandaio and one great painting each by Rubens, Fragonard, Manet and Degas. Hours and admission: See above (Smith). * ''PORTRAITS BY INGRES: IMAGE OF AN EPOCH,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 2). This luxurious show includes several dozen drawings by Ingres along with his greatest portrait paintings. There is something almost inhuman about them. Technique on Ingres's level is spooky. The most touching thing about his art in general is the degree to which it survives under the impossible pressure of his expectations. The exhibition ends, in a shimmer of satin and jewels, with the late portraits of Mme. Moitessier, Vicomtesse d'Haussonville and Princesse Albert de Broglie, and with his last work, a calculatedly simple self-portrait, which he finished in 1865, two years before he died, at 87. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman). * JOHN SINGER SARGENT, ''Portraits of the Wertheimer Family,'' Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Feb. 6). A reunion of a dozen Sargent portraits, commissioned by the wealthy Jewish art dealer Asher Wertheimer. The ensemble hung in the family's London home, but the bequest of nine of them to the National Portrait Gallery in the 1920's aroused the ire of British worthies, who felt they didn't belong in a museum devoted to exalted Britons. Most of the portraits were eventually consigned to storage at the Tate Gallery. The show's catalog raises interesting issues: the position of Jews in English society and to what degree Sargent stressed his friends' Jewishness, given the slight edge of caricature and stereotype that he conferred on many of his portrait subjects. Most of the paintings give a wonderful account of Sargent's bold brushwork and his talent for finding and projecting his subjects' individuality. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck). ''SENSATION: YOUNG BRITISH ARTISTS FROM THE SAATCHI COLLECTION,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 9). As is almost always the case in culture wars, the event that provokes the skirmish turns out to be much less entertaining and far less significant than the political fight. This exhibition will be a huge disappointment to anyone expecting true shock. You're obliged to go anyway if you want to be able to say that you saw what all the fuss was about. The paradox of the culture wars is that they have made celebrities out of artists who would otherwise vanish. This may be the best argument, in the end, for unfettered freedom of expression. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman). ''TIME TRACED: RODNEY GRAHAM AND VERA LUTTER,'' Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 19). This show contrasts large black-and-white photographs by Rodney Graham with those of Vera Lutter. Mr. Graham's large-format images of magnificently ancient trees are inverted, imitating the effect of the rudimentary camera obscura. The mind struggles to make sense of them: the trees suggest giant root systems or reflections while also adding to a landscape tradition that stretches from 17th-century Dutch painting to the photographs of Atget. Ms. Lutter works with specially built pinhole cameras, making photographs of vast urban industrial sites that seem abandoned. The images are in their original negative state, which pushes them further into a silvery twilight zone. An empty factory, a German zeppelin hanger and New York City's giant Pepsi-Cola sign shot from the Queens side are seen in ghostly irradiated states that suggest the final glimpse of a world before it went up in smoke. Hours and admission: See above (Smith). * ''CARLETON WATKINS: THE ART OF PERCEPTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 9). Standard books about photography published in the first half of this century ignored him, and the public forgot him. Now this show gives many people their first real chance to encounter not just the greatest American landscape photographer of the 19th century but also one of the greatest American artists of the 19th century and one of the great photographers, period. Watkins was a genius. His subject was the West, and his mammoth-plate pictures, panoramas and stereographs (taken with the dual lens camera that simulated, in a kind of cut-out version, three dimensions) mixed the highest degree of clarity with a lean, home-grown compositional style and a spare beauty. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman). Galleries: Uptown * MARCEL DUCHAMP, ''The Art of Making Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,'' Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500 (through Jan. 15). This show, organized by Francis M. Naumann, a scholar of Dada, Surrealism and Duchamp, accompanies his richly researched book of the same name, the first to focus solely on Duchamp's replications: paintings, sculptures, readymades and graphic works in profusion. This lovingly assembled homage is a feast for Duchamp lovers and an education for those who approach him more warily (Glueck). NAUM GABO, ''Pioneer of Abstract Sculpture,'' PaceWildenstein, 32 East 67th Street, (212) 421-3292 (though Jan. 8). An important figure in 20th-century art, the Russian-born sculptor Gabo (1890-1977) was among the earliest artists to make truly abstract works in 3-D, and this show gives a very sketchy outline of his long career. He progressed from Cubist-based art, all hard-edged curves and angular planes, to pure geometrical constructions. Later works in the show, made after he came to the United States in 1946, seem more decorative and less interesting, out of tune with the rigorous purity of his early work (Glueck). ALFRED JACOB MILLER, Gerald Peters, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760 (through Jan. 29). Miller (1810-1874) was among the earliest artist-explorers of the American West. Despite some European training, this Maryland-born artist was a mediocre painter at best. This selection of small works, including portraits of Indians, a buffalo hunt scene and studies for a picture of a bewildered fellow on a small horse, called ''The Lost Greenhorn,'' are interesting more for historic than artistic reasons (Ken Johnson). SCAR MUNOZ, Throckmorton, 153 East 61st Street, (212) 223-1059 (through Jan. 9). This Columbian artist inventively experiments with photographic processes. He makes self-portraits by filtering charcoal through a photographically treated silk-screen onto a tray of water. Amazingly, the powder coheres as a picture on the surface of the water, and when the water evaporates, a ghostly image remains permanently fixed to the bottom of the tank or to immersed sheets of paper. Works in progress and finished pieces are on view here (Johnson). ALFRED H. MAURER, ''Aestheticism to Modernism,'' Hollis Taggart Galleries, 48 East 73rd Street, (212) 628-4000 (through Jan. 15). More than 100 paintings from the prolific career of Maurer (1868-1932), a pioneer in American Modernism who was a dazzling colorist, a bold experimenter and the master of several styles. After settling in Paris in 1897 and achieving early success as a romantic realist, he made a dramatic switch to Fauvism and some of the best works here are in the Fauvist mode. Cezanne, too, had an impact, as seen in still lifes, heads and nude figures from his Paris days. Driven home in 1914 by World War I, Maurer was involved with Cubism in the 1920's and early 30's. The show includes fine and ho-hum examples from all phases of his career (Glueck). Galleries: 57th Street RAY SMITH AND JULIO GALAN, Sotheby's and Ramis Barquet, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-9090 (through Jan. 6). This two-gallery show presents works from the 80's (at Sotheby's) and the 90's (at Ramis Barquet) by two 40-year-old Mexican artists who each make ambitious, surrealistic, psycho-sexually fraught paintings. Both artists have fallen off from their promising beginnings, Mr. Smith into tricky formal slicing and splicing and Mr. Galan into self-indulgent expressionism, but both remain artists of persuasive personal vision (Johnson). * ''STILL LIFE IS STILL ALIVE,'' Jan Krugier, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-7288 (Jan. 4 through 15). That the unassuming genre of still life has been the vehicle for some of the 20th century's most adventurous painting is a paradoxical truth affirmed by this excellent exhibition. The selection ranges from works by Modernist masters like Braque, Matisse and Morandi to efforts by idiosyncratic recent figures like Phillip Guston, Wayne Thiebaud and Walter Murch (Johnson). Galleries: SoHo TARO CHIEZO, Sandra Gering, 476 Broome Street, (212) 226-8195 (through Jan. 8). This disjunctive show is by an artist who divides his time between Tokyo and New York. It includes brusquely painted pictures of rudimentary cartoon monsters that call to mind Kenny Scharf, and, more interesting, Lego buildings drenched in wax and displayed in stacked, white cages. The possibilities of the latter might be worth developing to more improbable extremes (Johnson). ''CHOICE 99,'' Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-7745 (through Dec. 31). Seven established artists selected 27 emerging artists, producing an uneven, intermittently interesting grab bag of a show. Nan Goldin chose four photographers who look like her disciples. Janine Antoni's intriguingly various picks include knee-high, cartoonish sculptures of theatrical characters by Anissa Mack and a small grid painting by Douglas Ross in which each stitch of the canvas is painted separately, black, gray or white (Johnson). PAUL GRAHAM, ''End of an Age,'' Scalo, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 334-9393 (through Jan. 16). For his latest book project Mr. Graham photographed young adults at a dance club in Europe. The understated color portraits don't glamorize or sensationalize; rather, they capture mostly attractive but ordinary subjects in isolation at moments of meditative stillness, looking away. They seem suspended, uncertain, vulnerable (Johnson). SANDRA LERNER, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 226-1660 (through Jan. 4). Working on the floor on big expanses of raw canvas, Ms. Lerner combines traditional Chinese brushwork, Jackson Pollock's splatter, Helen Frankenthaler's staining and Agnes Martin's pencil lines to create pale, beige abstractions that are physically assertive yet spacious and delicate (Johnson). ''THE PROMISE OF MODERNISM: ART IN INDIA, 1890-1947,'' Dialectica Gallery, 415 West Broadway, (212) 226-8921 (through Jan. 15). New York will be seeing a lot of contemporary work from India in the years ahead. And anyone wanting an evocative sampling of what ''contemporary'' looked like in India more than half a century ago can do no better than to visit this handsomely installed exhibition of small paintings and drawings produced by artists of the Bengal School, centered in and around Calcutta, who blended traditional Indian themes, Western academic and avant-garde influences, and styles from China and Japan (Cotter). * RICHARD SERRA, ''Torqued Ellipses and Rounds: 15 New Etchings,'' Gemini G.E.L. at Joni Moisant Weyl, 375 West Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 219-1446 (through Dec. 31). Related to two of Mr. Serra's sculpture projects, the ''Rounds'' range from big circular splotches on spattered grounds to smooth-edged circles balanced in cleaner white fields; the ''Ellipses'' take the form of stretched ovals, some linked, some solitary, on spattered white grounds. The amazing thing about these densely black images is their almost dimensional textures, produced by a complex process that involved squeezing molten material onto a plate laid on the floor and pressing it through an aluminum screen. Days of chemical ''biting'' of each plate followed. The results are forceful works that can still only hint at the muscle of Mr. Serra's achievements in 3-D (Glueck). Galleries: Chelsea JOHN DUGDALE, Wessel & O'Connor, 242 West 26th Street, (212) 242-8811 (Jan. 3 through 9). Though deprived of 75 percent of his vision by an AIDS-related stroke, Mr. Dugdale continues to produce his signature blue faux-antique cyanotype photographs. His elegiac figurative works are heartfelt, but kitschy and bordering on arty soft porn; his still lifes -- pictures of three peaches in a row, for example, or a sliver teapot on a stack of saucers -- have an affecting formal and poetic restraint (Johnson). JENE HIGHSTEIN, Pamela Auchincloss, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 727-2845 (through Jan. 29). Mr. Highstein, who has worked for years at giving organic warmth to the chilly rigor of Minimalism, presents an impressive maquette for a huge sculpture: a bulging, stucco-walled structure shaped like an oval stadium bowl with portals around the bottom. The model, 6 feet high and 15 feet long, has a powerful gallery-filling presence. When realized at its full 30-foot height, it surely will be something to see (Johnson). JANE KAPLOWITZ, Rupert Goldsworthy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 414-4560 (through Jan. 15). After recycling images from ''Taxi Driver'' last year, Ms. Kaplowitz has taken on rap music advertising. In watery, muted acrylics on eight-foot sheets of paper, she reproduces posters for Snoop Dogg, Hot Boys and other stars, who appear in images of imperial, vaguely menacing splendor. Four enormous pictures in this tiny gallery impinge to powerful and fascinating effect (Johnson). GLENN LIGON AND KARA WALKER, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262 (Jan. 4 through 8). In shades of black and white, both these artists focus on race to metaphorically complex effect. Mr. Ligon buries resonant sentences by James Baldwin under heavy accretions of coal dust and carborundum. Ms. Walker presents inkblots with tiny cartoon additions that play with racist caricature, and a large cut-out silhouette of a 19th-century black woman holding up a monstrous, abject child with the body of a giant lizard (Johnson). AARON ROMINE, Kravets/Wehby, 529 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238 (through Jan. 5). This California-based painter, in his first New York solo show, produces a bizarre mix of old-fashioned academic figure painting and pornography. Working painstakingly from photographs of his young male and female friends, in nude group poses, he paints curiously affectless, more or less sexually explicit tableaus. Formally and technically they are dull, but the tension between the high-minded and the low is amusing (Johnson). Other Galleries ''E. W. GODWIN: AESTHETIC MOVEMENT ARCHITECT AND DESIGNER,'' Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3023 (through Feb. 27). Godwin (1833-1896), a polymath who functioned as architect, antiquarian, designer, creator of stage sets and costumes, journalist and critic, was a major player in England's art-for-art's sake Aesthetic Movement. But by the turn of the century his name had faded and his work was in limbo. In recent years his maverick contributions to 20th-century modernism have begun to be recognized, however, and this show is an ambitious attempt to establish a firm place for him in the history of architecture and design. The show presents examples of his furniture, notably the Anglo-Japanese pieces that were his specialty; specimens of his wallpaper and textile designs, architectural plans and photographs and sketches of his theatrical ventures. But be warned: it demands patient looking and an eye for detail (Glueck). * ''INVERTED ODYSSEYS,'' Claude Cahun, Maya Deren and Cindy Sherman, Grey Art Gallery of New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (Jan. 4 through 29). Three women who have used the camera to reinvent themselves in multifarious guises share this show, based on a recently discovered cache of photographs by Cahun (1896-1954), a French-born writer and actress whose work was rarely shown in her lifetime. Performing for her lens the roles of clown, Buddha, sailor, courtesan, rag doll, vampire and even her father, Cahun gives a tantalizing glimpse of a very private universe. Deren (1917-1961) starred in her own epic films, stills from which are shown here. And Cindy Sherman dreams up multiple personas relating more to the kitschy psychodrama of American culture than her own interior life. One of the fresher presentations of the season (Glueck). ''ISSEY MIYAKE MAKING THINGS,'' Ace Gallery, 275 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 255-5599 (through Feb. 29). An ambitious, often snazzily installed exhibition that reviews some of the highs and one or two lows of the Japanese clothing designer's brilliant career. Mr. Miyake's genius for new materials and techniques is spelled out in a gallery called ''Laboratory'' and brought to life in one called ''Jumping.'' Here, 24 brilliantly colored, ingeniously pleated, folded and wrinkled garments are suspended from the ceiling like abstract sculptures. As they drift and bounce (with mechanical aid), they reveal both their engineering and the freedom of movement they allow. Equally liberating are their lack of cultural specificity and their refusal to project an ideal female body. Mr. Miyake is more modern than postmodern, a sincere formalist who has made some of the most radical, optimistic and generous clothes of his time. Admission: $6 (Smith). * ''THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS,'' Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718) 448-2500 (through Jan. 2). Two rewarding shows, one of photographs of children and the other of works made by artists under the influence of toys, ponder the mystique of the child. In photographs by 13 artists ranging from Lewis Carroll to Sally Mann, the child seems a stranger from another planet. Toylike works by a dozen artists, including lesser-knowns like Gail Goldsmith and Robert Kalka and better-knowns like Tom Otterness and Ellen Phelan, join innocence and experience to resonant effect. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $2 (Johnson). FRED TOMASELLI AND LEE BOROSON, Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through Jan. 7). Mr. Tomaselli presents a single, spectacular painting called ''Gravity's Rainbow.'' Imbedded in lustrous clear resin, necklace-like chains of pills, marijuana leaves, flower blossoms and cut-out photographs of body parts crisscross a deep black 8-by-20-foot field to richly decorative and cosmic effect. In the Sculpture Court (through March 17), Mr. Boroson's expansive highway cloverleaf made of inflated blue parachute silk hovers overhead, absurd yet utopian (Johnson). Last Chance RICHMOND BURTON, Cheim & Read, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 242-7727 (through Thursday). With each show Mr. Burton seems a little more to relax his impulse toward symmetry and to indulge his gift for ornament. He does both in the melodious, jazzy abstract paintings here. With their metallic colors -- gold, silver, copper -- they have the fluid, textural presence of luxury fabrics; their densely packed curving patterns suggest flames, leaves and scraps of Arabic calligraphy (Cotter). ISABEL DE OBALDIA, ''Captive Spirits,'' Mary-Anne Martin Fine Art, 23 East 73rd Street, (212) 288-2213 (through today). Demons, beasts, gods and ghosts are the subjects of these fanciful small-scale sculptures by a Panamanian artist. Made of milky cast glass infused with color, they glow with a gentle translucence that gives them a presence more spectral than physical. Some are on the edge of being cute, but their charisma prevails (Glueck). GORDON MATTA-CLARK, David Zwirner, 43 Greene Street, SoHo (212) 966-9074 (through today). This selection of work from the early 1970's by the legendary architectural deconstructor gives a good sense of his playfully anarchic avant-gardism. Included are ''Garbage Wall,'' a wall of street refuse; a puzzle consisting of detritus from the artist's floor; and ''Fresh Air Cart,'' a low-tech vehicle for dispensing oxygen from a tank to people on the street (Johnson). THOMAS STRUTH, ''New Pictures From Paradise,'' Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160 (through today). This new body of mural-scale prints in color and black and white by Mr. Struth, a German photographer, is devoted largely to what he calls ''paradises'' -- dense primeval jungles in Australia, Japan and Southwest China -- with several digressions to cathedrals in Italy and a temple in Japan. Lush and wild in their aboriginal state, the jungles seem tangible enough to engulf the viewer who steps too close. In sharp contrast, the cathedrals and the temple articulate civilizations centuries in the making. These photographs may not be models of lighting, composition or artifice, but they are impressive because of Mr. Struth's passionate immersion in his subjects (Glueck). MIKE COCKRILL, Kim Foster Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-0044 (through today). Working with wide, loaded brushes, Mr. Cockrill paints pictures of prepubescent girls threatening and abusing abject clowns (Johnson).

VThe lacy curtains from the secondhand shop flutter over the bedroom window. The white tiles salvaged from the garbage dump gleam on the kitchen floor. ''The white people, they threw this away, too!'' exclaimed Patrick Mbatha, 38, chuckling over his good-as-new wicker sofa and the inexplicable ways of wealthy white people. ''You can see the quality! It's a good cane. I saw it and right away I put it in the boot of my car.''

VPolice officers in Greenwich Village still remember her, the crazy, homeless bag lady who screamed at passers-by on Eighth Street in the 1980's, begged for spare change, or thrust her mad poetry into startled hands. Time and again, when she got too wild or the weather grew too bitter, the police carted her off to a psychiatric ward or a jail cell. Time and again, she returned to forage for food in garbage cans, to call out her love for the universe in an ecstasy of mania and marijuana, or to rail at the rich who walked by her on the sidewalk. Once, she even punched a stranger in the nose and sent his glasses flying.

VSean (Puffy) Combs, the multimillionaire rap entrepreneur whose career and lavish East Hampton parties have been fodder for the gossip columns, was arrested on gun possession charges with the actress and singer Jennifer Lopez after shots were fired at a Times Square dance club early yesterday, the police said. Three people were wounded in gunfire at 2:55 a.m. at Club New York, sending panic-stricken clubgoers into the frigid air outside the nightspot at 252 West 43rd St., the police and witnesses said. The police described the victims as bystanders, and said that none of them suffered life-threatening injuries. Neither Ms. Lopez nor Mr. Combs was charged in connection with the shootings, and Ms. Lopez was later cleared of any involvement and released.

VVictor Santiago, a fast-rising rap performer from Queens who performs under the name Noreaga, was arrested Sunday night on narcotics charges after undercover officers spotted him and three other men sharing a marijuana cigarette in his car, the police said yesterday. Mr. Santiago, 22, was charged with criminal possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor. He was released from custody by Judge Robert Raciti of Queens Criminal Court. The charges against Mr. Santiago will be dropped if he is not arrested again in the next six months, said Mary de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney's office. The other men who were arrested were also released.

VHere is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone, especially during the holiday season when many galleries close for longer periods. Also, some museums are closed New Year's Day. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show. Museums ''THE AMERICAN CENTURY: ART AND CULTURE, PART 2: 1950-2000,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 13). Filling the museum's six floors, this complicated, conflicted exhibition once more demonstrates the difficulty of mounting sweepingly inclusive exhibitions with no discernible point of view. It displays hundreds of works in dozens of mediums expertly placed in contexts that constantly pull one's attention outward, toward the show's flickering edges: landmark events, famous personalities, banned or controversial books, emblematic snippets of film, song and television and even the ephemeral. But these do not disguise a discouragingly conventional core and the predictable, severely truncated story told by the objects on view. The many great works in the show's first half tend to be overly familiar because they are mostly drawn from the museum's collection. Moving toward the present, the works become weaker, the choices of artists arbitrary, the sense of history increasingly confused and the absence of non-American artists more and more glaring. Ultimately one senses not an ''American Century'' or even half-century but two decades, the 1950's and 60's, during which American art -- seen in isolation -- held its ground. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Closed New Year's Day. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).

VRussell Merrill and his neighbors have spent every weekend this month scouring junk heaps for a winch and a telephone pole, cutting plywood and wrapping 250 feet of lights -- the kind you see on the sides of tractor-trailer trucks -- to make their own New Year's Eve ball. It stands perched 57 feet in the air, in what folks here call Maxfield Common, just in front of the iced runway that will be used on Friday afternoon for turkey bowling, a competition in which two bowlers roll frozen birds at wooden pins.

VIn a rainbow blizzard of confetti and a symphony of neon and fireworks, a mighty crush of New Year's merrymakers welcomed the year 2000 in Times Square, the world's most famous intersection. Undeterred by fears of terrorism or Y2K havoc, the Times Square crowd showed every sign of being the biggest and noisiest ever, bent on watching history happen, watching themselves on huge video screens and hoping that friends and relatives were watching them on television at home.

V''Inappropriate'' is not ''Rent.'' A theatergoer might be forgiven for thinking it is, since the show, a rock musical, stars an ensemble of young actors wearing headset microphones, attitude and the combination of layers, mismatches, glitter and sportswear that make up homeless-person chic. Averie Boyer, who is excellent in his understated way as one of the central performers (there are no character names), even looks something like Anthony Rapp, who played Mark in ''Rent's'' original Broadway and Off Broadway cast. But ''Inappropriate'' is something else. Imagine that a group of troubled teenagers -- who have been sent away to a special boarding school, presumably to straighten them out -- put on a show. And that parts of it turn out to be so good that the show ends up on a New York stage. That's the history of ''Inappropriate,'' performed by the theater company of the DeSisto School in Stockbridge, Mass.

VWhen voters in Maine went to the polls in November and endorsed the use of marijuana as a medicine, it was more than a victory for cancer patients and others who say marijuana will help relieve their pain. For a small coalition of libertarians, liberals, humanitarians and hedonists, the vote was another step forward in a low-profile but sophisticated crusade to end the nation's criminal laws against marijuana and other psychoactive drugs.

V''You used to be big,'' Joe Gillis says to Norma Desmond, the faded movie actress, when he meets her in ''Sunset Boulevard.'' You may remember what she says in reply: ''I am big. It's the pictures that got small.'' Perhaps this is the moment, early in an uninspiring and seemingly endless presidential campaign, to construct a Sunset Boulevard theory of politics. Or at least to raise the question: Has the whole enterprise shrunk down to insignificance as the new century begins? Or is it just the politicians who have gotten small?

VMusic rarely divides itself into eras as neatly as it did with the century that just ended. The 1900's were the disc era, when both musicians and listeners took for granted that music could be captured and repeated. Not too long from now it may be seen as a brief historical interlude between sheet music and the Internet. The phonograph was treated as a dictation machine for a decade after Thomas Edison invented it in 1877. Cylinders of recorded music were first sold in 1890. But in 1901 the cylinder gave way to the disc, and the rest is in the grooves. Recording preserved music that would have vanished into the air, and it changed practically everything else that was related, from the length of songs to the way they were performed, learned, sold and savored. It catalyzed a century of mind-boggling musical invention in blues, jazz, show tunes, country-and-western, gospel, salsa, soul, rock, hip-hop and all their subgenres, along with international idioms from bossa nova to juju to reggae. The immediacy and portability of recordings established a new, intimate relationship between performers and listeners, while ideas bounced around the world, leaving no style completely pure.

VThe glamorous world of Miami Beach celebrity culture collided yesterday with the gritty workings of what prosecutors called a Brooklyn Mafia crew, as a South Florida nightclub impresario charged with murder was ordered released from custody on $15 million bail. As a white stretch limousine waited at the curb outside Federal District Court in Brooklyn, two fixtures of South Beach nightlife, Ingrid Casares, a restaurateur, and Sofia Vergara, a model and Spanish-language television personality, milled in the hallways with their publicist, Lizzie Grubman, waiting to offer the nightclub owner, Chris Paciello, support.

Scarsdale high schoolers who are in the virtual yearbook or the ibook, as it is called, and who check its pages regularly for postings and updates, say they feel that they have breached a time warp of sorts, re-awakening teenage memories while forging new or renewed adult connections. ''You have a history with these people and an obligation to nurture and keep it a living part of your life,'' said Marlo Lewis, a staff director of the House Government Sub-Committee on Regulatory Affairs in Washington.

VIT'S 1980 at McKinley High School in Michigan. A handsome young football player tells a beautiful cheerleader, ''Ashley, I love you so much it scares me,'' and they embrace. It's like a perfect moment on one of those WB teenage dramas, and it is the only such moment we will ever see on ''Freaks and Geeks.'' Having established what the show is not about, the camera swoops below the bleachers, where grungy teenagers are smoking cigarettes and talking about wearing a Molly Hatchet T-shirt picturing a bloody severed head to church. Next, a scrawny freshman is threatened by a bully but saved, humiliatingly enough, by his big sister. Afterward, the sister utters the show's credo: ''Man, I hate high school.''

VIn the long, lurid history of drug trafficking along Mexico's border with the United States, perhaps no fugitives have been more notorious than the six brothers Arellano Felix. Since 1993, when gunmen working for them murdered a Roman Catholic cardinal, several of the brothers have been among the most wanted men in Mexico. In 1997, after the Arellanos were accused of killing a series of Mexican police officials, one of them was named to the F.B.I.'s 10-Most-Wanted list.

Mr. Tucker fled, running practically into the arms of a second police car that had been alerted by the first about a fleeing man. Just before he was captured, Mr. Tucker tossed a clear bag into a cellar opening. It contained crack cocaine.

VThere has always been some hustle in Tony Horne, whether back in Boston or in Queens, where he grew up stressed out by seeing friends jailed and killed, and families, including his own, ripped apart. Or later in Rockingham, N.C., in high school and at Clemson in college, where he lived in sleepy towns but found a way to be awake, aware and prone to mischief. Horne, the St. Louis Rams' fleet receiver and kickoff returner, is a prime player often buried among the Rams' array of blindingly quick offensive skill players. But when searching for Horne in the Rams' locker room, he can be found with a noticeable twinkle in his eyes, a soft voice and an intense desire to be special. To make a difference.

VOver the last two years, the White House has reviewed some scripts and advance footage of such television shows as ''E.R.'' and ''Beverly Hills 90210'' under a little-known financial agreement with the networks that encourages them to include anti-drug messages in plots of programs. As part of the arrangement, White House drug policy officials scrutinized in advance more than 100 episodes on all the major networks. If the government signs off on a particular show, the networks receive credit that reduces the number of costly public service announcements they are forced by law to broadcast.

VI did not take long for word to get out on the high school grapevine -- a party in Pound Ridge. Nor did it take much time for the scene to get out of hand. By the time the police arrived at the private home here last fall, more than 300 teenagers -- some as young as 14 -- had paid $5 for a cup that entitled them to all the beer they could drink. On New Year's Eve the scene was Dobbs Ferry. There, the cover charge was higher -- $20 a person -- and when the police arrived some 160 teenagers had gathered at an abandoned building. Two boys who attended the party, 16 and 18, were hospitalized for alcohol poisoning, and a 19-year-old man was arrested on charges of possessing marijuana and hashish. Teenage drinking is nothing new. But educators, the police and experts in substance abuse say the teenage drinking scene today is far different from what it was a generation ago. First, teenagers are drinking at much younger ages and drinking considerably more than teenagers did 20 years ago. Further, there is widespread availability of drugs at parties. Also, there is a trend toward bigger parties, which can quickly spiral out of control. Moreover, the consequences of the impaired judgment brought about by teenagers' drinking alcohol or taking drugs are far more lethal -- both because of the spread of the AIDS virus and because more teenagers carry weapons than in past generations. At the same time, like generations before them, most teenagers maintain a strong belief in their own immortality. ''You take those factors and you put them together and you have a prescription for a true crisis,'' said Richard Kraemer, the principal of Fox Lane High School in Bedford. ''I have been a principal for a long time, and I have been to too many funerals. Some of them might have happened anyway, but others were directly attributable to drugs and alcohol.'' In the wake of the highly publicized parties, principals of high schools throughout Westchester have recently felt compelled to confront the problems of teenage drinking. But in doing so educators have a difficult balancing act. They are confronting behavior that takes place outside school hours and off school grounds. At the same time, the teenage party scene in the county has a profound effect on what goes on in the schools. ''Kids were talking about nothing else that week,'' said Scott Mosenthal, the principal at Irvington High School, referring to the party in Dobbs Ferry, which attracted teenagers from Irvington as well as Ardsley and Hastings-on-Hudson. ''While this may not be a school problem, we are a community with kids. Just the fact that all this was going on had an impact. We ended up forfeiting a couple of varsity games, because athletes were involved, and we had to spend a lot of energy and time on it rather than on traditional education. At the same time, you try to turn it into an educational opportunity.'' The party in Pound Ridge last fall attracted students from Fox Lane High School as well as Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, John Jay High School in Cross River and the Harvey School in Katonah, the police said. In response, 21 principals from northern Westchester signed a letter sent last month to parents of high school students, which urged them to be responsible and offered guidelines on how to handle teenage parties. Fox Lane High School held a community forum recently on the subject, and Irvington High School plans to do the same next week. ''Do I want to be involved in controlling students' parties?'' Mr. Kraemer said. ''The answer is no. I have no intention of becoming a parent to 1,000 students. But I am an educator, and they are my kids for six hours a day, 180 days a year. I want to help adults deal with these pressures and bring the community to a common understanding.'' A 17-year-old senior at Fox Lane High School said he had attended many open house parties with cover charges. Many people he knew got ''very, very drunk'' at the Pound Ridge parties, which he said were larger gatherings than usual, but not atypical in terms of the drinking. He added that among many students the question was not whether they would drink but how much they would drink. ''A lot of people say, 'I want to get drunk, but I don't want to get plastered,' '' he said. The difference? ''When you're plastered, you wake up but you don't remember,'' he said. ''When you're plastered, you do things that make you not want to look at yourself in the mirror in the morning.'' One aspect stressed at the Bedford meeting was the criminal and civil liabilities that parents face because of teenage parties. Earlier this week, three parents appeared in court here as a result of two teenage parties in Pound Ridge in the fall. One parent, Leslie Saul, 47, was accused of buying three kegs of beer served at one of the parties, and he pleaded not guilty to one count of endangering the welfare of a child and one count of unlawfully dealing with a child. Mr. Saul's son is a senior at Fox Lane High School. Also in court were Edward and Diane Conte, at whose home one of the parties took place. They are accused of endangering the welfare of a child. ''Some people felt arresting the parents was extreme,'' said Joseph C. Beccera, an investigator with the New York State Police. ''But the point has to be made that hosting parties where alcohol is served to the underaged is against the law and won't be tolerated.'' Investigator Beccera said the local police learned about the Pound Ridge party after an 18-year-old boy was killed in a driving accident a mile over the New York State line in Stamford that night. The investigation ultimately revealed that the boy had attended a different party earlier that evening, but it also led the police to the gathering for which the parents were arrested. Lt. Betsy Gilardi of the Dobbs Ferry Police said that an investigation into the organizers of the New Year's Eve party is continuing and that arrests are expected. The teenager who was host of the party held it in an empty building owned by his father. Substance abuse experts say that many parents misunderstand the current teenage drinking scene. In some cases, today's parents were children in the 1960's and have a more relaxed attitude toward alcohol and drugs. Other parents are simply naive and do not realize how much the youth culture has changed. ''It's very common to hear from parents, 'What's the big deal -- when I was in high school, I drank. My friends drank,' but it is very different today,'' said Ellen Morehouse, the executive director of Student Assistance Services in Tarrytown, which provides substance abuse counseling to middle schools, high schools and colleges in the county. The biggest change is that younger children are drinking and children are drinking more, Ms. Morehouse said. She cited a 1999 University of Michigan study that showed an increase in the percentage of eighth graders and 10th graders who reported binge drinking -- which is defined as five or more drinks in a row. Of 40 percent of 10th graders who reported drinking, 26 percent reported binge drinking in the last two weeks; 15 percent of eighth graders said they had been binge drinking in the last two weeks. ''I hear over and over again from seniors, 'Hey, we party, but I'm really worried about those ninth and 10th graders. I mean, we never drank like they do. They're out of control,' '' Ms. Morehouse said. She added that counselors from high schools throughout the county are reporting heavier drug and alcohol use among ninth graders. The senior from Fox Lane High school agreed. ''It used to be just a thing for the seniors and juniors. There would be an open house party, and they'd go and drink. But now it's this influx of freshmen and sophomores who want to be considered cool. They may not even necessarily like to drink, but if they do they can be cool.'' Younger teenagers are not only physically smaller, and therefore less able to process the alcohol, but also less socially developed to cope with situations that arise at drinking parties. Not only are they more likely to engage in unprotected sex, Ms. Morehouse said, but they are also more likely to be exposed to other drugs. She added that the presence of weapons at parties is also on the rise and that at a big party in an upscale community in northern Westchester recently, a gun had been fired, though no one was hurt. ''I tell parents that when you were in high school the risk that drinking would kill you was much lower,'' Ms. Morehouse said. ''When you were in ninth grade and at a party, there wasn't heroin so pure you could snort it, there wasn't the chance you were going to get AIDS, there wasn't a chance you could get shot.''

The issue arose on his campaign bus when he said he disapproved of the medical use of marijuana by cancer and AIDS patients. Asked if he had ever tried marijuana, the Arizona Republican said, ''No. Also remember my age: 63.'' Alison Mitchell (NYT) BAUER's LUCKY 7 --Gary L. Bauer has recruited the Iowa septuplets to help his campaign.

VFor about two years the White House and the television industry have been engaged in a cozy little enterprise that, on the surface, seems to promise benefits for everyone. The administration's anti-drug campaign gets a boost. The television industry gets to add dollars to the bottom line. But on closer inspection, it is a deeply unhealthy arrangement that should disturb anyone who believes in the need for all media -- the entertainment industry as well as the networks -- to remain free from government meddling. Under the arrangement, according to an article in this week's Salon Internet magazine, television networks have been secretly submitting scripts for some of their most popular television shows to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy as a way of getting more than $22 million worth of credit for required public service advertising. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug czar, then allots advertising points for segments that convey an anti-drug message -- a scene in which a youth rejects an offer of marijuana, for example, or a passage showing a group of drugged-out teenagers looking like losers.

The candidates and their aides can find the nightly monologues by Jay Leno on NBC's ''Tonight'' show, by CBS's David Letterman, who is recuperating from a bypass operation and expects to be slinging barbs in about two months, by Conan O'Brien on NBC's ''Late Night,'' Bill Maher on ABC's ''Politically Incorrect,'' Jon Stewart on Comedy Central's ''Daily Show'' and on other programs, at one level funny, outrageous and obviously distortions of the truth. At another level, though, the advisers say, the monologues are playing a crucial, if flawed, role in shaping voters' perception of candidates.

VA highly potent and expensive variety of marijuana available recently in the New York metropolitan region was grown, not in the hills of Central or South America, but in an industrial park on Long Island, law enforcement officials said today. They announced the arrest of two men who, they said, used high-technology hydroponics to grow the drug, without paying their electricity bill. Investigators said the operation, which illegally tapped into power lines, used high-intensity growing lamps attached to timers, aluminum reflectors, carbon dioxide generators and potent water-soluble fertilizers in a closed, controlled environment. They said the operation was the wave of the future in the illegal production and marketing of marijuana, and that the resulting product was highly sought by users because it created a quick and intense high.

VHillary Rodham Clinton answered questions today about her marriage and personal life for the first time since she began traveling through New York State last summer in pursuit of a seat in the United States Senate. Responding to a series of questions from a radio talk show host here this morning, the first lady said she had never been unfaithful to President Clinton and had never had a sexual relationship with Vincent W. Foster Jr., a close friend and former deputy White House counsel who committed suicide. She also said she had never used marijuana or cocaine.

A request for the session by a left-wing legislator was originally denied for security reasons, but then granted when he petitioned the Supreme Court. Deborah Sontag (NYT) ISRAEL: EDUCATION SWITCH -- The Education Ministry, under a new, leftist minister, has decided to pay for Reform and Conservative Jewish educational programs for the first time. Education Minister Yossi Sarid explicitly overturned the country's lifelong Orthodox-only state financing, saying he believed in ''religious pluralism.'' The Orthodox dominate Israel's religious life and do not recognize the liberal streams of Judaism. Deborah Sontag (NYT)

VBECAUSE of its sophistication and vertiginously high production values, the ''Martha Stewart Living'' show is often thought of as an entirely original concept that sprang directly from the mind of its creator. Yet, in its obsession with the polishing of candlesticks, the folding of towels and the almost Prussian deployment of napkins and bed linen, Martha Stewart actually owes an enormous debt to the implacably didactic ''mental hygiene'' films that were popular in American schools from 1945 to 1970. Just as Buster Keaton's primitive but brilliant films paved the way for the more technically sophisticated work of the Marx Brothers and Woody Allen, such short films as ''Dinner Party'' (1945), ''Let's Give a Tea'' (1946) and the seminal ''Let's Be Clean and Neat'' (1957) prepared an entire generation of Americans for the more nuanced pleasures of Martha.

VJuggy Gayles, whose career in the music business stretched from the Lindy Hop to hip-hop, died in his sleep on Monday at the Parker Geriatric Nursing Home in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He was 86. Mr. Gayles promoted hit songs as a song plugger bringing material to big bands and crooners, as a music publisher, as a promotion man getting songs played on the radio and as a partner at a hip-hop record label. ''My creative power has always been in publicizing great geniuses,'' he said in a 1994 interview in Rolling Stone magazine. ''I didn't make hits. All I did was help make a hit.''

But as the presidential primaries neared, the day before closing the issue, Newsweek editors pulled the excerpt, which featured new allegations of marijuana use by Mr. Gore two and a half decades ago. The book, ''Inventing Al Gore: A Biography,'' by William Turque, a Newsweek political correspondent in Washington, is to be published by Houghton Mifflin in March.

VFilemon B. Vela is a federal judge, but a Border Patrol agent recently mistook him for an illegal immigrant or a drug smuggler. Mr. Vela and three aides were driving on an isolated road when the agent pulled them over. Why? Because, the agent explained, there were too many people in the car. The agent apologized and moved on, but the mistake did not surprise the area's highest elected official, the Cameron County judge, Gilberto Hinojosa. An agent once followed him closely for 10 miles as his wife and baby sat in back, Judge Hinojosa said. Another agent refused to let him board a plane to Houston until he stated his citizenship, he said. ''It feels like occupied territory,'' Judge Hinojosa said. ''It does not feel like we're in the United States of America.''

VThe Clinton administration released a set of goals today intended to improve the health of the population over the next decade, even as officials acknowledged that the country had failed to meet 85 percent of targets set 10 years ago for such concerns as smoking, obesity and exercise. In releasing the two-volume report, senior officials of the Department of Health and Human Services said the nation had met only 15 percent of 319 targets established in 1990 and was making progress on 45 percent. In some areas, particularly obesity, marijuana use among teenagers, exercise and asthma and diabetes, the health of the American people remained the same, or in some cases worsened.

V''Restaurant'' is the kind of movie that deftly registers the self-conscious gawkiness people exhibit at weddings, especially when they're dancing. It's a movie that attends to the tones and rhythms of a stoned late-night conversation between old friends, to the hectic clatter of a restaurant kitchen on a busy weekend night and to the edgy, exhausted buzz of an impromptu after-hours party in a crowded apartment. It pauses to record, with admirable tact and affection, the pillow talk of young lovers after their first night together, and it does not flinch from the tears and accusations that ensue when things begin to go wrong between them. Because Eric Bross, who directed ''Restaurant,'' and Tom Cudworth, who wrote the screenplay, pay such close attention to the details of their story, they manage, more often than not, to get the big themes right. This is a movie with a lot to say about class, about friendship, about ambition and about race, but it does its talking, for the most part, through the experiences of its characters and the particularities of its northern New Jersey setting.

VSince the recent arrests of adults stemming from a teenage drinking party in northern Westchester, the media have been buzzing regarding the subject of teenage drinking and what to do about it. [''Underage Drinkers Getting Younger and Drinking More,'' Jan. 16]. Much of the advice publicly aired from experts has encompassed police enforcement and what I would call the ''itinerary'' strategy: know where your kids are, who they are with, etc. While these tools are surely part of the prevention arsenal, discussion of the main weapon, parental modeling, has been strangely absent. Simply put, parental alcohol use and parents' attitudes toward drinking influence the decisions their children will make regarding alcohol.

VJohn knows he can rile Paul by criticizing his need for fame, so he lays right into him: ''How many adoring fans do you need to know you're good?'' he says, peering coolly through round, tinted glasses. ''You've got to say goodbye to Mommy and Daddy, otherwise you're just looking for approval, trying to please because it makes you feel wanted.'' Cut. On a dark rooftop, as they pass a joint, Paul looks into John's tearful face and tells him: ''I see a frightened man who doesn't realize how beautiful he is.'' Cut.

VA romantic drama about a Brooklyn girl who finds fulfillment in the boxing ring, a first-time director's story of estranged siblings in a small town and a documentary about South Africa's struggle for justice won top honors at the 16th annual Sundance Film Festival tonight. The festival, the premier event in the independent film world, concludes its 10-day run on Sunday in Park City, Utah, its final day dedicated to encore screenings of tonight's award winners. This year's assortment of feature films, documentaries and short films was widely viewed as among the richest to appear in recent years at the festival, which has been the launching pad for such independent hits as ''sex, lies and videotape,'' ''Shine'' and ''The Blair Witch Project.''

VDr. Audra Stinchcomb says she has never smoked marijuana, but that does not prevent colleagues at the Albany College of Pharmacy from inquiring about her ''pot patch'' or ''doobie derm'' whenever they can. Her two-year effort to research and develop a medical marijuana patch that would release the drug's active ingredients through the skin has inspired more one-liners than she can recall. The patch is intended to be used by cancer patients for relief from nausea, vomiting and other side effects of chemotherapy.

VThe players association, as expected, filed a grievance yesterday challenging Commissioner Bud Selig's suspension of John Rocker, then explained why the move did not create a conflict among union members, many of whom have been critical of the remarks by Rocker that prompted the disciplinary action. Selig suspended Rocker for all 45 days of spring training and for the first 28 days of the season, and fined the Atlanta Braves' closer $20,000 on Monday. The players association, in its grievance, said the discipline was ''without just cause.''

VFIFTY years ago, the British mathematician Alan M. Turing predicted that by about the turn of the century, the average person would not have more than a 70 percent chance of distinguishing a human from a computer program trying to imitate a human in a question-and-answer session. At Dartmouth College on Friday, such a test of man- versus machine-made wit proved at least one thing: to err in prediction is very human indeed.

VDespite prediction fifty years ago by British mathematician Alan M Turing that by about the turn of the century the average person would not have more than a 70 percent chance of distinguishing a human from computer program, test of man versus machine at Dartmouth College has cast aside the prediction; in Dartmouth test, none of six computer programs came close to convincing judges that they came from human voice; test was organized by Prof James Moor, computer ethicist who conducted 10th annual competition for Loebner Prise, an award for program that most closely mimics human conversation; most of contestants were programs known as chatterbots, which contain limited knowledge base meant to keep human user occupied in casual conversation; photo of judges (M)

VFor the last six months, a 35-year-old Bronx building superintendent has been inviting young boys into his apartment with the promise of Pokemon cards and Chinese food. Once there, according to the police, he showed them pornographic videos, plied them with marijuana and sexually abused them, sometimes secretly videotaping the illicit sex acts. The man, identified as Miguel Marcial, 35, was arrested on Thursday and charged with sexual abuse, sodomy and endangering the welfare of a child. Yesterday, the police held a news conference to release his photograph and to urge other youngsters who may have been molested to come forward.

VAfter stewing for 24 hours in crowded holding cells, Robert Schenck found himself in a drab first-floor courtroom of the Manhattan Criminal Courts building one night last month, exhausted, confused and charged with trespassing in a Washington Heights apartment building. Mr. Schenck, a 29-year-old South Carolina man, insisted he was a bystander wrongly caught up in a police sweep. With a job in construction and no criminal record, he did not fit the typical profile of a criminal defendant. But he was about to encounter the assembly-line justice of Manhattan night court, side by side with hardened felons and repeat offenders.

VWE have come to expect a great deal of the Sundance Film Festival, the independent film world's annual gathering in the snowy, condo-packed valleys of the Wasatch Range. Besides offering a great confluence of buzz and celebrity, a career-advancing opportunity for young filmmakers, a meat market for agents-on-the-make, a bazaar for indie-film distributors and a stage for artiste poseurs and hustler manques, it is also regarded as the year's prime opportunity to take the pulse of American independent filmmaking. ''I think it's probably as good a measure as any that's out there,'' said Robert Redford, the actor and Oscar-winning director whose Sundance Institute sponsors the festival, which ended its 10-day run here a week ago.

VForcing a sudden end to a nine-month student strike, hundreds of federal police officers took over the main campus of the national university today and arrested more than 600 students who had occupied Latin America's largest center for higher learning. The operation, carried out without bloodshed, was the most important intervention by government forces at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since the student movement of 1968, which ended in a massacre that traumatized a generation of Mexicans and left them determined to make the country more democratic.

VRichard Dumas, who was suspended for drug and alcohol abuse by the National Basketball Association twice in the early 1990's, once said that if the league ever tested players for marijuana, ''there wouldn't be no N.B.A.'' For the first time the league is now testing for marijuana, and Dumas's calculations appear more than slightly off. According to two people with knowledge of the results, 12 out of 430 active players tested positive for marijuana during training camp last fall.

VWith her official declaration for the United States Senate behind her, Hillary Rodham Clinton flew into a region of New York today that is likely to be a prime battleground in the race this fall, turning her attention to what has long been a dominant concern among voters here: the region's long-suffering economy. With President Clinton back in Washington, the first lady moved to settle into life as just another candidate running for public office. She gave the first of what aides said would be five speeches between today and Friday, this one offering measures to spur economic growth here, including about $550 million worth of tax incentives and grants to encourage Internet development. She granted three one-on-one interviews with reporters, a notable break with her more cloistered first seven months of traveling the state. She visited a part of New York where Democratic candidates for office always campaign.

VGordon, a villager whose family has been fishing the waters off Jamaica's southeastern coast for generations, needed a little extra cash. So one day last year, another fisherman introduced him to a local cocaine smuggler. Gordon became a bit player in a growth industry. In his 18-foot boat, he makes regular pickups at prearranged spots a few miles offshore. Occasionally he is called at the last minute to pluck floating packets from the sea when they are jettisoned by traffickers spotted by American and Jamaican coast guard patrols.

V''The Beach'' is an attempt by all the major talents involved to try something new. For the first 10 minutes, the movie slices forward like the prelims of the latest adrenaline splurge at the Extreme Games. It reaches an early peak when Robert Carlyle -- the flesh-and-blood yang to the yin flash of the director, Danny Boyle -- pops up as Daffy, a buzz-cut head offering words of wisdom to Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio). Playing to the back row, Mr. Carlyle is so potent a presence that he's one of the few actors for whom Dolby Digital is wholly unnecessary. Daffy tells Richard about an island paradise not found on any conventional map. And Richard, a young American vacationing in Thailand and looking for something off the beaten path, follows Daffy's map in search of promise.

VAll week long, a small, close-knit group of students at Columbia University has puzzled over the paradox of Thomas G. Nelford Jr. What inner torment could have possessed a bright young man they knew as a pacifist, artist and all-around mellow California dude to suddenly slash the throat of a woman he had just taken home for Christmas? Were it not for the fact that Mr. Nelford subsequently threw himself in front of a subway train, dying instantly, his friends said, they would have found it impossible to even imagine that he had killed Kathleen A. Roskot, a 19-year-old sophomore and star lacrosse player at Columbia.

VTo the Sports Editor: I'm not surprised that few National Basketball Association players tested positive for marijuana recently (''N.B.A. Finds Minimal Use of Marijuana in First Tests,'' Feb. 7). Drug tests are easily beaten with a combination of temporary abstinence and masking agents. If the sole purpose of testing is to improve the N.B.A.'s image, the tests are proving very effective. Nonetheless, the success of drug tests may come back to haunt the N.B.A.

VIn his nonthreatening but persuasive way, David Stern laid down an ultimatum tonight. Stern, the National Basketball Association commissioner, all but begged the city of Houston to help finance a new arena for the Rockets by 2003, or else. ''I think it's more than probable'' that the Rockets would change cities without a new arena, Stern said at his annual news conference at the All-Star Game. ''I think it's certain the team will be relocated.''

V''Hook was the greatest playground player ever from Oakland. He could jump over cars and dunk. He was better than all of us. He could have been one of the best players in the N.B.A. It was just one of them things. He took one route and we took another route.'' -- Gary Payton, All-Star guard Demetrius (Hook) Mitchell picks up the telephone on the other side of the thick glass separating inmates from visitors at Santa Rita Jail. He wonders why a stranger has come to speak with him during visiting hours on a Thursday night.

VRaul Rodriguez remembers his two and a half years in jail on murder and drug charges as a journey through shades of blackness. He refused to allow his youngest son to visit him. He lost a promising job as a salesman at a software company. The gangs that he had tried to escape by leaving central Los Angeles surrounded him. Deepening his despair was the ridicule that he endured from fellow inmates when he talked about being exonerated. ''I told them, 'I think I'm gonna beat this thing,' that I was framed by the police,'' recalled Mr. Rodriguez, 30. ''They laughed and said, 'Man, you don't understand. Nobody beats the cops in this town. Nobody's gonna believe you!' ''

VIn the past two weeks, there has been a steady stream of articles about Vice President Al Gore's apparent need to ''embellish what is already an impressive resume,'' as the columnist Arianna Huffington put it. ''Gore keenly senses he's not perfect and rewrites history to try to make it so,'' Margaret Carlson wrote in last week's Time magazine. Almost every one of these stories -- whether emanating from The Boston Globe and The Chicago Sun-Times or from the Drudge Report and Rush Limbaugh -- quotes a memorandum I sent to Al Gore, then a senator, when I served as his campaign press secretary during his first run for president in 1987-88.

VA citywide antidrug crackdown that was spurred by higher crime figures has swamped the court system over the last two weekends, bringing a record number of arraignments to Manhattan courts one night and leading to complaints that hundreds of suspects were detained illegally for more than 24 hours. The jump in arrests stems from Operation Condor, a $20 million antidrug crackdown announced by the Police Department last month to counter an increase in the city's homicide rate last year, police officials said. The initiative, which pays narcotics officers to work overtime to make arrests, mainly on weekends, has generated 10,000 additional arrests since it started on Jan. 17.

Three years have passed, but in her deepest sleep, she still hears police sirens wailing, still tosses and turns to the haunting images that race through her mind like a locomotive. High heels clicking. Cars driving past. Horns blaring. Headlights flickering. Hands gesturing.

VBEING a young American pursuing ''la vie de boheme'' isn't what it used to be. After the image of the bohemian merged with that of the hippie, and a once-marginal drug culture invaded American high schools, the cliches of the urban hipster and the avant-garde were swallowed by the ''cutting edge'' marketing of MTV and the Internet. Yet the archetype of the bohemian rebel hasn't entirely vanished. It has simply been reconfigured as a sporty backpacker combing the globe in search of adventure, a purer environment and better drugs. It's an archetype ready-made for Hollywood, especially when it's embodied by everybody's favorite young rebel, Leonardo DiCaprio. In ''The Beach,'' Danny Boyle's film adaptation of Alex Garland's popular novel, Mr. DiCaprio is Richard, a pleasure-seeking backpacker who finds himself alone and itching for adventure in swinging Bangkok. Richard's vague search for heaven on earth (with some requisite danger thrown in) leads him to a secret commune on a remote coastal island that can be reached only by swimming to its shores.

VTHE phone in his home in Port-au-Prince kept ringing. The voices told the 31-year-old Haitian man that they would kill his father and rape his wife and his mother. A few days later, in September 1998, he bought an airplane ticket to the United States. In Haiti, the man's human rights group had worked with people who had suffered under the military regime that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. He had spoken with countrymen who had had their eyes gouged out, limbs hacked off.

VMichael Chabon's 1995 novel, ''Wonder Boys,'' chronicles a hectic weekend in the life of Grady Tripp, a frustrated, concupiscent college teacher mired in at least three ill-starred relationships: to marijuana, to his elephantine unfinished manuscript and to the wife of his department chairman. More Anne Tyler than John Updike, the book plays Grady's dilemma for gentle comedy and lingers fondly over the quirky geography of a proud, battered American industrial city, in this case Pittsburgh. ''Wonder Boys'' is intoxicated by its setting and enchanted by writing: by the sweet, fizzy soda pop of its own style and also by some unabashedly romantic notions of the literary life. Mr. Chabon's characters tap out their manuscripts on old typewriters, are reckless in love and loyal in friendship and suffer from the creative agitation Grady calls ''the midnight disease.'' In bringing ''Wonder Boys'' to the screen, Steve Kloves and Curtis Hanson have tried to be faithful both to its spirit of bittersweet farce and to its beguiling profusion of detail. Mr. Hanson and his production crew have assiduously rounded up a Citroen (though not, as in the book, a convertible) and a vintage Ford Galaxie, an I.B.M. Selectric and a pair of red cowboy boots. They built themselves a Pittsburgh dive, complete with neon signs and Naugahyde banquettes. And to their great credit, they allowed Pittsburgh to play itself, a picturesque late-19th-century city of red brick factories and dark, wainscoted interiors, whose weather seems to consist of variations on snow, rain and wind.

VThe Tigger Movie With the voices of Jim Cummings, Nikita Hopkins, Ken Sansom Narrated by John Hurt Directed by Jun Falkenstein G -- 76 minutes A. A. Milne's ''Winnie the Pooh'' bunch via Disney animation pitches in to help their companion Tigger cope with the fact that he is the only one of his breed and thus has no family. Each friend helps in his own way, which means that Owl lays on plenty of pontification, Pooh is constantly distracted by the need for honey, the ponderous Eeyore can't get out of his own way, Piglet frets too much to be effective and Rabbit, who is the most capable, has other priorities. Tigger is left to deal with the problem more or less by himself. When Owl suggests that a family tree might be the best place to start determining one's roots, the tiger bounds off through the Hundred Acre Wood gazing up every tree trunk wondering if it could hold knowledge of the whereabouts of what he is sure must be a flock of relatives.

VJustin Huish, an Olympic gold medalist who dominated the archery competition during the 1996 Games, surrendered in court in Ventura, Calif., on charges that he sold marijuana to a police informant. Felony arrest warrants for Huish, 25, and his roommate, Brian Mastrangelo, 24, were issued Wednesday by the Simi Valley police, and they appeared in court Thursday. They each face up to four years in prison if convicted of possession of marijuana for sale.

VWhen protests erupt over news gathering, the usual complaint is that someone printed fiction instead of fact, rumor rather than truth. But not here. In this boutique-size town, where stone fences and woods surround large homes on Connecticut's southern shore, halfway between Manhattan and Providence, R.I., residents are condemning the local newspaper for publishing what they believe is an overkill of truth. For the last three weeks, petitions have been circulating here and in a neighboring town, Guilford, calling on the local government to force The Shore Line Times, a small 123-year-old paper published twice weekly, to stop printing its police blotter. The blotter, which starts on Page 2, provides the name, age, address and alleged offense of everyone arrested in Madison and Guilford in the previous week.

The home was one of the first his social service organization helped build in Bushwick a decade ago. Since then, he has spurred the construction of hundreds more new houses. ''To me it's beautiful,'' said Mr. Lopez, a towering man with the sound of Brooklyn in his voice. ''You might say it's not Manhattan, but you should have seen what was here before.''

VTwo lively Supreme Court arguments on police practices found the government on the defensive today, as the justices suggested that the police might have violated the Constitution by frisking a Miami teenager on the basis of an anonymous tip that he was carrying a gun and by squeezing a bus passenger's soft-sided luggage to see if it contained drugs. The court appeared surprisingly unimpressed by the government's arguments, in one case that guns are so inherently dangerous that the police are justified in acting on the basis of a bare-bones tip that might otherwise be insufficient, and in the other case that passengers relinquish any expectation of privacy in their luggage once they toss it into an overhead bin where it can be pushed and shoved by others seeking room for their own bags.

There, he did not even have his own bed and fell asleep in a place that neighbors say was filled with noise, drugs and guns. And on Tuesday, the police say, the 6-year-old got his hands on one of those guns, stuffed it in his pants pocket and went off to first grade, where he killed a classmate.

VA little before 12:30 p.m. on Dec. 30, 1997, a masked gunman walked into a bodega on Strauss Street in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. There were four other people in the store: the owner, Jesus Martinez, known affectionately in the neighborhood as ''Poppy,'' a teenage employee named Frankie Rodriguez, and two young customers, Candace Daniel, 13, and Steven Green, 15. The gunman raised his .38-caliber revolver and shot Mr. Martinez in the chest, killing him. Frankie Rodriguez turned and ran. The gunman chased him down an aisle, shooting at him. When Mr. Rodriguez stumbled and fell, the gunman stood over him and fired a fatal shot into his back.

VIn what is believed to be the first documented link between smoking marijuana and heart attacks, a study has found that a middle-age person's risk of heart attack rises nearly fivefold in the first hour after smoking marijuana. The study was presented yesterday by Dr. Murray A. Mittleman at the American Heart Association's annual conference on cardiovascular disease in San Diego. Dr. Mittleman, an internist, heads a team of specialists that has been reporting on risk factors in heart attacks for the past six years. Members of the team are from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health, all in Boston.

VBruce Barket, a straight-arrow defense lawyer and former Nassau County prosecutor, agreed to defend Antowine Butts in a double homicide case because the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, was thinking about seeking the death penalty against Mr. Butts. Mr. Barket has a private practice, but at times takes on capital cases through the state's Capital Defender's office. When Mr. Hynes decided to forgo the death penalty, seeking instead a sentence of life without parole, Mr. Barket decided to stay with the case because he was convinced that Mr. Butts was innocent.

VWITH two minutes left to play yesterday in what would be a 70-55 rout of Boston College on the first day of the Big East tournament, Khalid El-Amin, the University of Connecticut's effervescent junior point guard, sat on the bench celebrating. El-Amin was animated as he laughed and smiled with teammates. The smile used to be his signature, but for El-Amin and Connecticut, the care-free smiles have been a lot tougher to come by this season.

VThe half-dressed Carnival masqueraders who had flowed through the streets like a glittering, feathery river were gone this morning. Gone, too, were the body-rocking calypso rhythms that had turned the city into a giant boom box. For Steve Richards, the worry was not what was gone, but who had vanished. He runs Rebirth House, a drug rehabilitation program that operates four recovery homes.

VExpressing skepticism about a city law, a federal appeals court yesterday overturned parts of a lower court decision that had supported the New York Police Department's denial of a parade permit in 1998 to a group advocating the legalization of marijuana. The new ruling was the latest in a series of judicial decisions that have questioned the Giuliani administration's handling of parade permits and its compliance with First Amendment guarantees of free speech.

VFollowing a protest and a series of complaints by minority students, Princeton University's Department of Public Safety said it regretted posting flyers containing a description of a black male with ''short, black woolly hair'' in response to a report of a man waving a gun in a campus dining area. Officers had searched the room of Damon Nabrit, a freshman. The gun they found turned out to be a toy, which was not illegal, but they found two marijuana pipes and arrested him for possession of drug paraphernalia. He was released on his own recognizance. The protest last week drew 40 people, who complained that the university's security division has a history of mistreating minorities. RICHARD BRAND

VThe starting forward Desmond Allison was arrested on charges of drunken driving and marijuana possession and is not expected to play in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Coach Tubby Smith suspended the 6-foot-5-inch sophomore on Sunday night. Fifth-seeded Kentucky (22-9) plays 12th-seeded St. Bonaventure in the first round Thursday in the Midwest Regional in Cleveland. Allison's absence leaves the Wildcats with only nine players. Allison started 29 of Kentucky's 31 games this season, averaging 7.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists. He is the team's top foul shooter, a 3-point threat and among the team's best passers and defenders. According to university policy, the 20-year-old Allison will be suspended temporarily. If convicted, he will be suspended indefinitely and will forfeit his scholarship.

VINVENTING AL GORE A Biography By Bill Turque Illustrated. 448 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $25. In outline at least the Al Gore who emerges from Bill Turque's thoughtful new biography will be familiar to anyone who has followed print and television coverage of his vice presidency and the opening rounds of the 2000 campaign: a cautious politician who frequently seems programmed, despite labored efforts to retool his image with a ''game-show host wardrobe'' and a high-decibel congeniality; an often awkward man whose Boy Scout persona belies a slashing braggadocio and a Clintonesque taste for double-talk and self-promotion. What Mr. Turque, a Washington correspondent for Newsweek, has done in ''Inventing Al Gore'' is to amplify this portrait of the vice president with lots of details and a carefully considered appraisal of his career. There isn't much that's actually new in this book, save the claim of two former friends that Mr. Gore was an ''enthusiastic recreational user'' of marijuana through the early 1970's, which was already cited in Newsweek's recent excerpt from this book.

VWith four-tenths of a second remaining in an already improbable game stretched into one overtime, David Messiah Capers of St. Bonaventure created an epic from that sliver of time. He stood alone on the foul line, his team trailing by 3 points. Capers, a 55.6 percent free-throw shooter, had three free throws. His Kentucky opponents threw out insults to rattle him and Coach Tubby Smith of the Wildcats called a timeout after each of his first two shots in an attempt to ice him. But Capers calmly swished all three to send the first-round game into double overtime. In turn, he sent the crowd in the Cleveland State Convocation Center into pandemonium and Kentucky's weary players searching for oxygen.

VIF nothing else, the police undercover team that shot and killed an unarmed black man in Midtown early yesterday would seem to be guilty of monumentally bad timing. Whether the officers are guilty of much worse must wait, of course, until the criminal-justice system is finished with them. As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said, it is best for ''everyone not to jump to conclusions.''

VAn unarmed Brooklyn man waiting for a taxicab was shot and killed outside a bar on Eighth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan early yesterday in a scuffle with three undercover narcotics detectives, the authorities said. The details of the shooting were sketchy last night and there were conflicting accounts of the episode. But a senior investigator and a man who saw the scuffle said the dead man, Patrick M. Dorismond, 26, who worked as a security guard for the 34th Street Partnership, was angered when one of the undercover detectives approached him and sought to buy drugs.

VDetective Anthony Vasquez, the police officer involved in the fatal shooting yesterday of an off-duty security guard, has spent most of his five years on the force as an undercover officer in a unit that focuses on drug dealing by street gangs. The unit's mission early Thursday morning, according to investigators, was to make marijuana purchases in an area of Midtown Manhattan just south of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Investigators said they believed that members of the Bloods gang had come to dominate the drug trade in the area.

VAn unarmed man slain by a backup undercover narcotics detective outside a bar on Manhattan's West Side flew into a rage, punched an officer, ignored shouts of ''Police!'' and was shot when he grabbed the detective's gun and it discharged once into his chest, a lawyer for the officer said yesterday. The lawyer for Detective Anthony Vasquez said that the victim, Patrick M. Dorismond, 26, a security guard for a Midtown business association, had grown belligerent after being asked by another undercover detective if he had any marijuana to sell, and had suddenly escalated the quarrel into violence after all three officers in the confrontation tried to back off.

VAbout two dozen witnesses have been interviewed. Physical evidence -- a gun, a bullet, bloody clothing -- has been bagged and tagged. As always, police officials have promised a full and fair investigation. But as New York City grapples with yet another fatal police shooting of an unarmed man, questions of blame are rapidly being overshadowed by a bitter, politically charged battle over the temperament and character of the two men at the center of this shooting -- Patrick M. Dorismond, the 26-year-old security guard who was killed outside a Midtown bar early Thursday morning, and Anthony Vasquez, the 29-year-old undercover detective whose service weapon fired the fatal shot during an attempted drug sting.

VTo the editor: I'm disappointed that Mr. Crouch cops out on something that really matters in his otherwise accurate appreciation of Louis Armstrong. Armstrong, who had ''endless energy and could play and play and play with the evangelical fire and charisma that brings a new art into being,'' was a confirmed, longtime user of and advocate for cannabis, which he considered an enhancer of musical perception and creativity. At a time when hundreds of thousands are being arrested for cannabis use, we need to heed Satchmo, who wrote, ''It really puzzles me to see Marijuana connected with Narcotics -- Dope and all that . . . it's a thousand times better than whiskey -- it's an Assistant -- a friend.'' I find it puzzling that Mr. Crouch, who seems to really love and understand Armstrong, doesn't stand up for Satchmo's much abused ''friend.'' SAM ABRAMS Rochester

Dorismond, the latest unarmed black man killed by a police officer. But over the weekend, the mayor enlightened us. ''The public has a right to know,'' he explained. That was it. Concern about an informed citizenry. From Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose administration so frequently withholds basic information from journalists, civic groups and elected officials that resorting to lawsuits has become routine.

VPressed to respond to charges that he is demonizing the victim, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday intensified his criticism of Patrick Dorismond, the unarmed man killed on Thursday by an undercover police officer, suggesting that his ''pattern of behavior'' and his actions the night of the shooting had contributed to his death. The mayor also confirmed that he had authorized the release of Mr. Dorismond's arrest record immediately after the shooting, citing the public's ''right to know.'' ''People do act in conformity very often with their prior behavior,'' Mr. Giuliani said yesterday during a television interview on ''Fox News Sunday.'' The news media ''would not want a picture presented of an altar boy, when in fact, maybe it isn't an altar boy, it's some other situation that may justify, more closely, what the police officer did.''

VFive days after an unarmed man was shot and killed by a narcotics detective outside a bar on Eighth Avenue, investigators are focusing on two widely divergent versions of the events that led up to the shooting of the man, Patrick M. Dorismond. After interviews with nearly two dozen civilian and police witnesses, focusing intensively on a handful of significant accounts, investigators have still found no agreement on who started the scuffle that preceded the shooting Thursday morning. Two police detectives say it was Mr. Dorismond. His friend and co-worker Kevin Kaiser, who was at his side that night, says one of the detectives who approached Mr. Dorismond to try to buy drugs threw the first punch.

VA Newark police officer was indicted yesterday on charges that he took a bag of marijuana from one teenager and threatened to plant it on two others he then molested, the Essex County prosecutor's office said. Charlotte Smith, an assistant prosecutor, said that while Officer Shawn Costa, 29, was on patrol on Oct. 11, he confiscated a bag of marijuana from someone, and a short time later stopped a car with two young women in it. Ms. Smith said that the officer threatened the 18-year-old driver and her 16-year-old passenger, then kissed and molested them.

VPolice officials said yesterday that they would add uniformed patrols this weekend instead of running an undercover narcotics operation normally financed with special overtime money. Officials would not specify how they planned to use the extra uniformed officers, who will be paid with money earmarked to finance the Operation Condor undercover operation. But there are several events scheduled for the weekend that are expected to draw large crowds, including the Hellenic-American Day parade on Sunday, and the funeral of Patrick Dorismond, the security guard who was shot to death last week during a scuffle with an undercover police officer.

VMore than a thousand mourners filled a funeral home in Brooklyn and the streets outside last night to pay respects to Patrick Dorismond, the 26-year-old security guard killed by a plainclothes police officer last week. Dozens carried or wore the Haitian flag, and Mr. Dorismond's cousins, who are renowned Haitian musicians, sang for him. Across Flatbush Avenue, the protesters carried pickets denouncing the police. Mr. Dorismond was the fourth unarmed black man to be killed by the police in the last 13 months.

VTwo months ago, to curb drug dealing and the violence it spawns, New York City embarked on an ambitious $24 million narcotics enforcement drive known as Operation Condor. Each day, there are 500 additional police officers -- some in uniform, some in plainclothes -- on the streets in high-crime neighborhoods, working overtime to stage drug stings and roust dealers from their street corner haunts. Police officials say that Operation Condor has been an unqualified success: drug trafficking has largely been driven indoors, overall crime is down 8 percent and narcotics arrests have increased 36 percent.

VShooting Raises Scrutiny Of Police Antidrug Tactics

VFatal shooting of Patrick Dorismond, unarmed man, during scuffle with members of New York City's undercover narcotics squad in midtown on March 16 raises questions about effectiveness, tactics and training of officers involved in expended narcotics efforts; police officials say ambitious $24 million narcotics enforcement drive is unqualified success; say great care is taken to ensure that officers involved are properly trained and adequately supervised; some community leaders voice misgivings; say use of aggressive tactics to arrest people for often minor crimes has only increased tensions in city where many black and Hispanic residents already view police with suspicion and fear; say antidrug program has had little impact on major crimes, producing only tide of arrests made up almost entirely of misdemeanors; chart (M)

VWILL it be the story of the kindly abortionist in rural Maine? The Philadelphia child psychiatrist with problems he doesn't know he has? The tobacco industry whistle-blower in Kentucky? The fine human being of a guard and his mysteriously powerful new inmate in a Depression-era Southern prison? Or the disillusioned suburbanite in the mood for change? Oscar's best-picture nominations are all over the place this year, in terms of cinematic geography and the likely distribution of votes. This is not an either-or contest, like last year's with ''Saving Private Ryan'' versus ''Shakespeare in Love'' (which won). It is not a foregone-conclusion race like the one two years ago, when ''Titanic'' made a sweep. This year ''American Beauty'' has taken a last-minute lead with its Screen Actors Guild Award for best ensemble cast of a film. But when the Academy Awards show begins tonight in Los Angeles, the winner is still anybody's guess. Here are the nominees and what they have to offer.

VA day after violence marred the funeral for the victim of a police shooting, criticism of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the city's Police Department intensified yesterday as the mayor vigorously defended himself and the police and denounced the protesters for what he called an ''orchestrated attack.'' At news conferences and in pulpits across the city, the mayor's political foes seized on the melee as further evidence of what they described as the mismanagement of a police department that they contended was losing the faith of New Yorkers, especially in minority areas, after a string of police-involved shootings of unarmed men.

VWEIRD LIKE US My Bohemian America By Ann Powers 287 pages. Simon & Schuster. $23. Ann Powers has been a record store clerk, a radical scholar on a Ph.D. track at Berkeley and an editor for The Village Voice. And for as long as she can remember, she has been a bohemian. In ''Weird Like Us: My Bohemian America,'' she argues that bohemianism is not only alive and well, it is thriving, and whatever inroads it makes into the mainstream only provide evidence of its power and vibrancy. Part cultural history, part personal memoir and part sociological theory, ''Weird Like Us'' is a rebuff to anyone who thinks bohemia is over. (Those who apparently consider it dead include bohemians in denial, cynics from the suburbs, and left-wing thinkers who say alternative culture is dead because nowadays it gets commercialized faster than you can say grunge Barbie.)

VThe Republican majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, today defended Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's response to the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man earlier this month. The Republican mayor has been repeatedly criticized by Democratic lawmakers and others for portraying the dead man, Patrick Dorismond, as a violent criminal with a hot temper, even as he praised the detective who shot Mr. Dorismond as a devoted and brave undercover officer.

VPolice officials said yesterday that they would review the tactics employed Monday by plainclothes officers, including at least one with his gun drawn, who chased a drug suspect through a Brooklyn schoolyard crowded with children. Parents angered by the incident at P.S. 305 in Bedford-Stuyvesant confronted police commanders at two meetings in the school yesterday to question whether the officers, in their pursuit of a suspected marijuana dealer, had lost sight of the risk to the children. ''The parents were angry and they were frustrated because they could not get answers to their questions,'' said the president of the school's parent-teacher association, Jacqueline Ferrell.

VMIDDLE EAST IRAN: U.S FLAG BREAKS TABOO -- For the first time in 20 years, the United States flag appeared on the front page of an Iranian paper when Hammihan, a Tehran daily, used a color photograph of the flag with an editorial about American-Iranian relations. In breaking an unwritten taboo, the paper opposed years of effort by the hard-line clergy to depict the Stars and Stripes as an object of hatred. Since the revolution in 1979, American flags have been routinely burned at anti-American protests. John F. Burns (NYT)

VWithin hours after a police detective killed Patrick M. Dorismond outside a Midtown bar earlier this month, the Giuliani administration began publicizing details of Mr. Dorismond's arrest record to try to suggest he might have been at fault in the shooting. The release of Mr. Dorismond's police record, including juvenile charges that had been dismissed and sealed by a court, outraged Mr. Dorismond's family, minority leaders and civil libertarians, and a state court is to consider whether city officials breached confidentiality laws in gathering the information and distributing it outside the Police Department.

A bullet fragment was lodged an inch under his right eye. The eyeball was permanently fixed at an odd angle. Mr. Bnyallay, 31, was a soldier who had rebelled against the Sierra Leonean government -- a ''sobel'' in the staggeringly complex classification of fighters who rose up as this country sank into lawlessness.

VIf I had seen Bob Hoskins play Manuel Antonio Noriega earlier, I would have paid a lot more attention to the American invasion of Panama. Also to the Medellin drug cartel of Colombia and to Central American politics in general. Apparently General Noriega, who is now serving a 30-year sentence (recently reduced from 40) in a federal prison, was not -- as one journalist recently suggested -- ''just another banana republic dictator.'' He was and is a character stranger than fictional, at least as depicted in ''Noriega: God's Favorite,'' which has its premiere on Showtime on Sunday night.

VPolice commanders yesterday defended two undercover narcotics detectives who fired a hail of bullets at five young men on a Brooklyn street Friday night, killing two of them, as the group tried to rob the officers with what turned out to be a toy pistol and a pellet gun. The detectives, who had what looked like three handguns placed menacingly to their chests, heads and backs, whipped out their own weapons and killed two of the suspects in a barrage of 23 rapid-fire shots at 9:15 p.m. Friday on Cooper Street, near Broadway, in Bushwick, the police said.

But the nurse said the boy was fine -- the smell was cigarette smoke and the other symptoms were caused by prescription medication for the flu. Two weeks later, Nicholas died of a heroin overdose.

VQ I live in a co-op in Carnegie Hill. Our building consists of families, working professionals and retired people. Recently, an apartment was sold to a young couple in their late 20's. Our problem is that now, at all times of the day, morning and night, the odor of marijuana permeates the halls and our elevator, too. We have young children, pregnant women and law-abiding citizens who live in our building, and never has a problem like this occurred. What can be done to stop this? . . . A. Smith, Manhattan A Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is the vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that in most cases, either the proprietary lease, the by-laws or the house rules of a co-op would provide the board of directors with the tools necessary to deal with the problem described by the letter writer.

On fashionable Tor Road near the boarded-up club, where the police said clients came to arrange dates and prostitution over the telephone, many passers-by expressed shock and dismay over the attack, which has been linked to a turf war between rival gangs of Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's largest crime syndicate.

VMAYBE because he's a band leader, Tito Puente can do a lot with his voice. It's not what he says, which more often than not he's said in his half million interviews before, but how he says it: a low, gravelly, been-around intonation, that goes down a half octave on the punch line. Tito, you tell him -- everybody, wherever he goes in New York, calls him Tito -- you're almost 77, you're on the road more than you're home, you have 118 records and CD's. Why do you need another one?

VHumble Mexicans who stand in the way of depleting the country's natural resources have often faced brutal treatment, but one such man has discovered in recent days that he has international friends to help him fight his cause. The man is Rodolfo Montiel, who organized peasants to block roads after loggers began felling virgin forests near his village in the mountains north of Acapulco. That peaceful 1988 protest slowed the logging, but it infuriated wealthy landowners and the generals at a nearby garrison.

VDespite a new, aggressive antinarcotics program and an increase in quality-of-life summonses, New York City's murder rate is still running substantially ahead of last year's. From January through March, there were about 13 percent more killings than there were in the same period in 1999, Police Department statistics show. But police officials said yesterday that the murder rate began to decline after March 17, when they put in place a series of measures focusing on the Bronx, where the number of killings had almost doubled. And they noted that most other violent crime was down.

The Queens district attorney, Richard Brown, said that a 15-month investigation had resulted in the arrest of 37 people charged as drug couriers and in the seizure of more than 4,400 pounds of marijuana. He said the drugs were seized from luggage and from packages delivered by Airborne Express, FedEx, D.H.L. and U.P.S. in the last year.

VA third of the overtime money earmarked for an ambitious, but much criticized, anti-narcotics initiative known as Operation Condor will be used instead to pay for increased uniformed patrols that will pursue a variety of other offenses, police officials said yesterday. The officials said that police commanders in New York City's five boroughs had requested more discretion in using the overtime money after finding that several months of narcotics sweeps had disrupted drug dealing at many street corner sites and that the money could now be better used elsewhere.

VHIS domestic violence and drunk-driving arrests are a hazy memory. But Steve Leslie says the lessons of that tumultuous period endure as a result of therapy in a Nassau County-funded domestic violence program where batterers receive acupuncture, take ''time outs'' from their tempers and learn to meditate. ''It helped me control my attitude,'' Mr. Leslie, a 40-year-old Bethpage auto mechanic, said the other day of the program, Spouse Abuse Group Education. ''It helped me think a little clearer. It helped me understand being a family. It helped me understand my relationship with my wife and kids.''

The privately owned company, GW Pharmaceuticals Ltd. of Salisbury, England, is ''trying to turn an illegal plant into a pharmaceutically regulated product'' by developing cannabis-based medicines that are not smoked, said Dr. David C.

There is no better example of this than an interview one team recently had with a player who was expected to be a fifth- or sixth-round selection at the college draft this weekend. The 21-year-old admitted to smoking marijuana once when he was 15 and again when he was 18.

The United States Civil Rights Commission began studying the city's policing practices last year, after the police shooting of Amadou Diallo and the torture of Abner Louima. It has been trying to determine whether the aggressive policing that has been credited with producing the city's steep drop in crime has also taken a toll on the civil rights of minority New Yorkers.

VIn a potentially far-reaching decision contradicting a 25-year-old Supreme Court opinion, a federal appeals court has ruled that in most circumstances, law-enforcement officials cannot rely on ethnic appearance as a factor in deciding whether to stop someone suspected of a crime. In a strongly worded decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declared on Tuesday that because of the growth in the Hispanic population in this region, ethnicity was an irrelevant criterion for law officers to stop a person, unless there was other very specific information identifying the suspect.

VWatching Olympia Dukakis perform ''Rose,'' a play-length monologue by Martin Sherman, will provoke an unpleasant queasiness in anyone who has ever felt guilty about dismissing a rambling grandparent. An 80-year-old Jew who grew up in the Ukraine, survived the Warsaw Ghetto and the postwar attempt by the British to stem the flood of refugees to Palestine, pursued the American capitalist ideal and ended up running a hotel in Miami Beach, Rose has lessons about the century to impart. But for all its picaresque detail, her story resonates on the tired frequency of a lecture about the wages of forgetting the past. If you are not of a certain age, you may react to her as a child to a relative who has overtaken one too many family gatherings: Yes, Grandma. Now can we go out and play?

Awaiting Gore Book Vice President Al Gore's 1992 environmental credo, ''Earth in the Balance,'' is being reissued next week. Republicans hope to use it to renew accusations that his environmental views are extremist. A26 No Pardon Would Be Sought President Clinton said that if he were indicted after leaving office he would not seek a pardon from his successor, even though he believed that his impeachment ordeal had inflicted enough punishment on him. A20 Budget Blueprint Approved Congress gave final approval to a $1.87 trillion Republican budget outline that sets up an election year showdown with Democrats over how the nation should put its current prosperity to use. A20 Congressional negotiators agreed on $7.1 billion in farm subsidies. A20 Suspect in Serial Killings The police in Detroit said a 26-year-old former Navy sailor, a suspect in three killings there, had admitted killing prostitutes during shore leaves in cities around the world.

A18 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Judge Backs Hevesi In Dispute Over Contracts A judge blocked the city from awarding $104 million in contracts to a company chosen to spearhead Mayor Giuliani's welfare-to-work program. The ruling, in a case setting the mayor against Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, threw into question $500 million in contracts with several companies. City Hall will appeal. A1 Mayor Assails Rights Panel Mayor Giuliani accused the United States Civil Rights Commission of being ''a political operation of the Democratic Party'' and suggested that an unfinished report on the police was meant to help the candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton. B4 New Tactics to Fight Virus The city will not spray malathion to fight the mosquito-borne West Nile virus, and will use helicopter spraying only as a last resort. A1 Budget Talks in Albany Republican and Democratic legislative leaders were said to be nearing agreement on increasing school aid by as much as $1.1 billion.

VTo demonstrate just how much a game of chance the National Football League draft is, these were the top 10 players picked in 1992: Steve Emtman, Quentin Coryatt, Sean Gilbert, Desmond Howard, Terrell Buckley, David Klingler, Troy Vincent, Bob Whitfield, Tommy Vardell and Ray Roberts. Busts, busts and more busts. Thus the following phrases, overused by various draft geeks, should be banned from the English language: ''destined to be great'' and ''future N.F.L. star.'' Because, in fact, no one knows. For goodness' sake, Emtman was the first pick in the draft and played only two years.

VRicky is one of the most appealing teenagers in my practice. Bright, funny and a genuinely cool kid, Ricky suffers from the worst case of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity that I have seen in 14 years as a pediatrician. He is also prone to serious bouts of depression, poor self-esteem, forays into alcohol and marijuana abuse, and, at unpredictable junctures, violent outbursts.

VThe rich may be different, as the saying goes, but the richly creative are different still. Just what goes on inside the head of an artist or a poet, however, is a mystery. Now, however, researchers from the University of California at Berkeley have learned a little about what went on inside the heads of some of the more creative artists and poets the world has known. The researchers have identified the mechanism by which absinthe, the liqueur of choice for the likes of van Gogh, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Toulouse-Lautrec and others -- indeed, for much of 19th century French society -- affects the brain. It makes neurons fire like mad.

VIt looks like a traditional bed and breakfast, at first. In the grand tradition, it stands proudly Victorian, with fancy flourishes, quirky nooks and painstakingly picked 19th-century antiques. But the Compassion Flower Inn also boasts an elaborate marijuana mosaic in the tile surrounding the hot tub in the lovers' suite, and walls stenciled with marijuana leaves in the ''hemp bedroom.'' As the nation's first bed and breakfast inn catering to medical marijuana users, the Compassion Flower Inn is receiving more attention for its opening than a five-star hotel. The co-owners, Andrea Tischler and Maria Mallek-Tischler, had spent so much time fielding calls in recent weeks that today, on the day before their big opening party, they and a small army of volunteers were still fussing with finishing touches.

It's about 2 a.m., and no other headlights are visible. It's just Latrell Sprewell and a straight and narrow stretch of pavement that unfolds before him like a red carpet. He cannot resist. He feels the urge to test the car's limits as if he is on a tempting first date.

VAfter all the snarling and braying about the recent surge in oil prices, isn't it about time that someone offered the moguls at OPEC at least a little thanks? True, the cartel may have gouged Americans out of billions of dollars by cutting production and artificially driving up prices. The spike in oil prices may have stoked fears of inflation and further destabilized an already skittish market. But the oil barons' bare-knuckled capitalism brought at least one positive side effect to New Jersey: it compelled state officials to re-examine their nonsensical ban on self-service gas stations.

VThe former Dallas Cowboy Sherman Williams has been arrested on charges that he ran a Texas-to-Alabama marijuana racket. Williams, who was arrested last Friday, is being held in jail in Mobile, Ala., pending a preliminary hearing Thursday. An F.B.I. affidavit made public yesterday quoted another suspect, Demetrius Thomas, as saying he bought about 1,000 pounds of marijuana from Williams during the past year. The police, with the assistance of an informant, said they videotaped Williams placing bags of marijuana in his vehicle last Friday before his arrest, the F.B.I. said.

VAs a high school varsity football player, Dennis Fleming waited impatiently for afternoon practice to end so he could sneak off and snort heroin. After being expelled from school for assaulting another student -- ''I split his head,'' Mr. Fleming explained -- he indulged his appetite for drugs full time. He was arrested several times for burglary and car theft, spent a Christmas in jail and drove his mother to the brink of despair, all for the sake of his next fix.

And, like many families in trouble, they have summoned a priest. Unlike many families in trouble, they have also laid in 13 half-liter bottles of vodka.

VLAST summer Officers Ray Montero and Jim Lloyd saw a man being beaten in front of a bodega on New South Main Street. They asked the victim if he wanted to press charges, but Officer Montero knew the answer would be no. He had been patrolling this street for 10 years and understood that the beating was an initiation for a new member of Chicano Nation, a Mexican street gang. Yonkers is home to 30 street gangs, which were responsible for 368 crimes over the last two years, ranging from harassment to murder, said Jeanine Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney. The growth of such gangs in Westchester, she said, is a spillover from stricter law enforcement in New York City.

VLOVE is in the air. So is laughter. And nostalgia for the wild and crazy young people we used to be. But where are the action movies of yesteryear? This summer season brings us only one gladiator, one war hero, a ''Mission: Impossible'' sequel, two westerns and a storm at sea. The filmmakers must be hoping all the horror and science fiction productions (the ''Blair Witch'' reaction?) and comedies of all sorts will make up for the absence of action spectacle. As always, opening dates are certain to change.

VIn 1996, a truck carrying nuclear warheads skidded off an icy road in Nebraska and crashed. For half a day, no one in government, including the president and his cabinet, knew the degree of danger, or if any nuclear material had escaped into the environment, because radiation monitors on the government's fleet of weapons trucks had been removed after complaints from drivers. The drivers had said the monitors showed that they were facing potential health risks from their cargoes.

On a recent first visit to an internist, I was handed a medical history form that struck me as unusually thorough in exploring factors that could affect my health or influence any symptoms I might have. The form reflected some of the most pressing medical-social issues of our day. In addition to the usual questions about my personal and family medical history, current symptoms or complaints about my health, allergies, operations, immunizations and personal habits like smoking and drinking, I was asked:

VThe Supreme Court took an expansive view today of the Constitution's bar against retroactive legislation, overturning a Texas man's sex abuse conviction on the ground that a change in state law had made it easier for the prosecution to prove its case than at the time the crime was committed. The 5-to-4 decision was unusually interesting in several respects, not the least of which was the extensive debate between the two sides over the current meaning of one of the Supreme Court's earliest important rulings, a case from 1798 called Calder v. Bull.

VSupreme Court, in 5-to-4 decision, overturns sex abuse conviction of Scott L Carmell on ground that change in Texas law had made it easier for prosecution to prove its case than at time crime was committed; rules 6 to 3 in Christensen v Harris County, Tex, that state and local governments can require their employees to use their accumulated compensatory time by taking paid time off, even if employees would prefer to keep accumulating 'comp days'; accepts appeal by Illinois and agrees to decide whether police can stop residents from entering their own homes during time it takes to get search warrant (M)

VThe authorities yesterday backed off an earlier statement that a convicted robber who was in a gun battle with the police in the Bronx on Sunday had probably fired a bullet that struck a bystander in the head. Instead, they said they were giving more weight to the possibility that the bystander had been shot by an errant police bullet. The bystander, Wilson Ramos, 48, an Ecuadorean immigrant and a father of three, remained in a coma in a surgical intensive care unit at Jacobi Medical Center.

Now they are setting up a memorial fund in their son's name dedicated to preventing what happened to him from happening to anyone else's child. Robert, a National Honor Society member who planned to study physical therapy at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn., this fall, had gone with more than 80 classmates and 8 chaperons on a school-sponsored bus trip to Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J., on April 14.

VHE was born to a world of yacht clubs, privilege and family tragedy. And after being lost in years of substance abuse, he finally evolved into a master of his craft. Being a master carpenter who restores and builds wooden boats in New Jersey makes Alan Hedges as rare as a hen's tooth in an industry that largely faded in the 1960's with the introduction of low-maintenance glass-fiber production boats.

VOutraged parents from New Jersey and Long Island called it a travesty and declared Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani a tyrant. One Long Island 18-year-old, in tears, called his mother and complained that court holding cells were hot and overcrowded and that he could not eat the jail food that guards offered him. And a 19-year-old vegetarian from Teaneck, N.J., said guards refused to provide her with a meatless sandwich, despite a sign saying they were available. The mayor's zero tolerance approach to petty crime collided with a new opponent over the weekend -- marijuana-smoking suburbanites. Police arrested 312 protesters, many of them young people from outside the city, at a marijuana legalization rally in Lower Manhattan on Saturday.

VA request from Patrick M. Dorismond's family yesterday for copies of his autopsy and toxicology reports was denied. But Justice Louise Gruner Gans of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's public discussion of the contents of the toxicology report created a possible legal avenue the family could use to obtain it. Derek Sells, a lawyer representing the Dorismond family, said he would file papers seeking the release of the toxicology report under the legal theory the justice outlined. Justice Gruner Gans said the autopsy report should be kept secret until the Manhattan district attorney's office completed its investigation into the fatal shooting of Mr. Dorismond on March 30 by an undercover police officer.

VAfter decades of caricature as the most self-indulgent and permissive generation in American history, baby boomers -- including Al Gore and George W. Bush -- are realizing it is time to get with the program. Despite their differences in political orientation, the two parties' presidential candidates, both of whom were born into the vanguard of the boomer generation, are delivering the same message on the campaign trail: ''responsibility.'' It is a message that goes to the personal and the political and speaks, the candidates hope, to a generation once famous for its idealism and its determination to do the right thing.

VJames Beathard Executed 12/9/99 James Lee Beathard received the death sentence for his role in the 1984 murder of Gene Hathorn Sr., 45, his wife, Linda Sue, 34, and their 14-year-old son, Marcus, while they were watching television in their mobile home outside Groveton, a small town in East Texas. There was no physical evidence to link Mr. Beathard to the crime -- no fingerprints, no footprints, no blood. After giving investigators several different versions of what happened on the murderous night, Mr. Beathard finally admitted he had been at the mobile home, that he had accompanied Gene Hathorn Jr. on what he thought was a drug deal. When Mr. Hathorn began shooting his family, Mr. Beathard said he ran into the woods and hid.

VShares in Australia's biggest supplier of accounting software, Solution 6 Ltd., surged after Chris Tyler resigned as chief executive to return to the United States. Mr. Tyler owns 11.8 million options in the company, worth 31.2 million Australian dollars. The resignation follows revelations of Mr. Tyler's past conviction for marijuana possession and involvement in a failed Canadian company.

VStepping up his criticism of Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to let taxpayers invest some of their Social Security taxes, Vice President Al Gore told a convention of older Americans today that the plan could jeopardize the retirement benefits even of current recipients. Injecting a sense of urgency into his dire warnings about Mr. Bush's plan, Mr. Gore argued that the proposal could have an almost immediate and negative impact by destabilizing the Social Security system, weakening the economy and reducing government resources for other programs, including Medicare.

VFirst we hated her for marrying Paul. She wasn't beautiful enough; she wasn't famous; she was American, for heaven's sake. Later we hated her for breaking up the Beatles (with Yoko's help), then joining her husband's new band when it was clear she couldn't sing, and wasn't she just a little too self-righteous about those vegetarian cookbooks and her work in animal rights? Then, two years ago last month, she died of breast cancer at the age of 56 and we made her a saint. Now Linda McCartney is the heroine of the baby boomers' new favorite love story. She and Paul McCartney were destined to be together and incredibly happy every moment of their 29-year marriage, you know. And he couldn't have cheated because they never spent a night apart (except for his six days in a Japanese jail in 1980 for marijuana possession). Proving that true love really does exist and that even the wildest, cutest, most happily promiscuous young rock star really just wants a farm in Scotland and four children and a good woman by his side. That kind of mythology is the use we make of famous people's lives, and then we make television movies about them.

VThe Revolution Lives Q. A faded old sign above the door at 9 Bleecker Street says ''Yipster Times,'' in a flowing, freehand script. When was it published? A. The Yipster Times was published, in one form or another, from 1972 until 1989, though in 1978 the name was changed to the somewhat less whimsical Overthrow. Primarily a journal of anti-establishment politics and culture, the newspaper also focused heavily on efforts to legalize marijuana. It was produced by a staff that was ''never larger than four to six,'' according to Dana Beal, the former editor and co-founder, and was sold at marches and rallies. The paper ''started out as a monthly, then sort of evened out as a quarterly,'' Mr. Beal said.

V1. Despite the fact that the artist Peter Dayton doesn't garden, and his wife, Barbara, paints dogs (a) while the Daytons are currently pet-less, it seems almost everyone else is thinking soft, green and fuzzy these days. Everybody into the compost heap! Gardening is the rage from hipsters to Hapsburgs, grandmothers to grandchildren. Case in point: ''Tiny Green Thumbs,'' a children's gardening primer (b) written by the gardening columnist C.Z. Guest -- the ''green-fingered queen,'' as Bruce Weber once described her -- for her grandsons. When young Gregory, Winston and Ivor visit at Templeton, Guest's house in Old Westbury, playtime is back to the earth. ''Oh, my God, they're such marvelous gardeners,'' Guest exclaims. ''They inspired the book.'' 2. The fashion crowd is thinking green, too. Hussein Chalayan's handmade tulle topiary dress (a) from his spring 2000 collection might be just the thing for mowing the lawn or feeding the chickens (011-44-171-240-5224) . Concerned about the domestication of the forest, the artist Pat Pickett ''personifies'' branches (b) in fashionable Geoffrey Beene-looking clothes. Pickett's work is included in ''Personal Space,'' an exhibition through June 4 at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton. 3. Think Wallpaper meets Country Life. From England comes the first groovy gardening magazine, Neweden. Why not? ''Gardening is the new sex,'' says the New York Observer columnist Simon Doonan. 4. And it's good for you. According to some estimates, gardening burns 300 to 400 calories an hour. According to Lori Turner, a University of Arkansas researcher, gardening helps prevent osteroporosis in women. But gardening can also break your heart. If a plant dies!? Usually overwatering is the problem. To the rescue comes Wormie the Water Sensor. Put Wormie in the soil, and if the soil is moist, his bottom half will darken. When Wormie dries out, his color lightens, and it's time to give him a drink. Flat water, not gin fizz. 5. Of course, you can always call a professional gardener. Among the new breed on the scene in the New York-Long Island axis is Tom Janczur, whose company, Soil, based in East Hampton, caters to the green needs of clients like Patrick McCarthy, the Fairchild Publications editorial director, and the interior designer Richard Keith Langham.I'm especially drawn to the New American Garden,'' says Janczur. ''It's simple in appearance, with strong sweeps of plant material. Structure and planning are essential.'' 6. The lighter side of the gardening craze is evident in ''Saving Grace,'' a new film starring Brenda Blethyn, which opens Aug. 4. Blethyn, who was nominated for Oscars for 'Secrets and Lies'' and ''Little Voice,'' plays a recently widowed gardener on the brink of financial ruin. She stops growing orchids on her idyllic Cornwall estate and starts growing marijuana with calamitous results. 7. This just in: According to Garden Design magazine, a French activist group, Le Front de Liberation des Nains de Jardin (the Liberation Front for Garden Gnomes) has been coursing the countryside stealing gnomes from lawns to free France from ''bad taste.'' A similiar group has sprung up in Germany. Indeed, gnomes are very non-U., as Nancy Mitford would say. England's Chelsea Flower Show bans them, but that hasn't stopped Philippe Starck from designing them. Starck's are included in an exhibition of gnomes dating from the Renaissance to the present, on view in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris until July 23. William Norwich

VMayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who upon ending his campaign for the Senate intimated that he would work to improve his relationship with minority residents, said in an interview broadcast yesterday that he had ''sympathy, concern and compassion'' for the family of a Haitian-American man killed by the police in March. The mayor made the remarks on Saturday in an intensely personal interview with Tim Russert for broadcast yesterday on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' Mr. Giuliani also said he had no regrets about his decision to drop out of the Senate race, given that he now realized that politics was ''not the most important thing in life.''

VChristine Lincoln's journey to Washington College, a small liberal arts institution in Chestertown, Md., was as circuitous as it was perilous. And she is as amazed as anyone that she is alive, let alone the recipient of one of the best-endowed literary prizes bestowed on an undergraduate. The award, which she received from a faculty committee at commencement last Sunday, is $54,266 and named for Sophie Kerr, a pioneering female journalist and author.

VTHE SETTING -- A screening on Monday of ''Grass,'' a documentary by Ron Mann that chronicles the 90-year history of American marijuana laws and the sundry ways in which Americans have flouted the prohibitions against it. The showing, at the AMC Empire Theaters on West 42nd Street, was the New York premiere of the film as well as a benefit for Norml, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The film is a fairly lighthearted look at a serious subject (''No hippies were harmed in the making of this film,'' the credits said reassuringly.) At an after-film party at Bar Code in Times Square, gift bags contained aromatherapy candles, a copy of High Times magazine and a small, mysterious brownie in a zippered plastic bag.

VOusted Police Leader Awaits Day in Court Oral arguments may be heard as early as Friday in the reverse discrimination suit filed by Carl A. Williams, the former superintendent of the New Jersey State Police who was ousted after making public comments linking minority groups to drug crimes. Mr. Williams, who is white, was forced to resign in February 1999, the day remarks he made in an interview appeared in The Star-Ledger. In it, he said that some crimes were more routinely committed by certain racial and ethic groups. He was quoted as saying: ''It would be naive to think race is not an issue in drug trafficking,'' and ''Two weeks ago, the president of the United States went to Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico about drugs. He didn't go to Ireland. He didn't go to England. Today, with this drug problem, the drug problem is cocaine or marijuana. It is most likely a minority group that's involved with that.''

VOne of the real heroes of ''Grass,'' Ron Mann's punchy and enjoyable new documentary on the history of marijuana in the United States during the 20th century, is Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York. While Harry J. Anslinger, the federal government's first drug czar, spent his career looking for a way to pin as many evils on marijuana as he could, and punishing those who disagreed with him, La Guardia calmly commissioned a study on marijuana use. The study concluded that ''the sociological, psychological and medical ills commonly attributed to marijuana have been exaggerated insofar as the City of New York is concerned.'' It's no wonder that an airport was named after him. ''Grass,'' which opens today at the Film Forum, begins with the adoption of anti-marijuana laws as part of an institutionalized racism toward Mexicans in the Southwest early in the century. Eventually, the film says, the laws were a bludgeon against anyone who threatened the status quo: the young during the 1960's, and before that, entertainers like Robert Mitchum and Gene Krupa. ''Grass'' misses out by not including a clip from the ''The Gene Krupa Story,'' a middlebrow attempt to depict the lurid world of jazz in 1959.

VALBANY: ABORTION BILL -- The State Senate yesterday approved a ban on what anti-abortion forces call partial-birth abortions, the third time it has done so. The Senate vote was 40 to 19, with Republicans voting 33 to 3 in favor, and Democrats voting 16 to 7 against. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, has prevented the issue from coming to a vote in the Assembly, where it appears to have enough votes to pass. Supporters say it bans a specific form of late-term abortion. Opponents say the measure improperly limits doctors' options. Richard Perez-Pena (NYT) ALBANY: HATE CRIMES BILL -- The State Senate passed its first hate crimes bill yesterday, after years of Republican opposition. The Assembly had passed a different version of the bill, but lawmakers in both houses predicted that a compromise would be reached soon. The bill, supported by Gov. George E. Pataki, provides for added penalties when a victim is singled out because of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, national origin or disability. The vote was 48 to 12. Richard Perez-Pena (NYT)

A 1999 survey of 15,349 teenagers in grades 9 through 12 found that half had tried alcohol, 35 percent had smoked cigarettes, 27 percent had smoked marijuana and 4 percent had tried cocaine in the month before the survey.

VAt 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, four tourists from Texas left the galleries in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and began to make their way through the crowds gathering for the National Puerto Rican Day Parade along Fifth Avenue. They were petite, middle-aged women, and they said they were made uncomfortable by the odor of marijuana and alcohol. Clutching their purses, avoiding eye contact, searching for a quick escape, they said, they headed for an opening between two groups of young men, perhaps 20 in all.

VArticle recounts violence that erupted during New York City's Puerto Rican Day Parade as mobs of young men assaulted women in and around Central Park; reviews controversy over police response, noting that while officers wrote hundreds of citations for public drinking, there was widespread feeling among people at scene that gross misconduct went virtually ignored; photos; Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and police officials strongly disagree, even as growing number of witnesses say officers failed again and again to provide even mild response to obvious disorder and lawlessness, or to specific complaints by women; Sharon Brown, 52-year-old Texas teacher who was one of four tourists accosted near Metropolitan Museum, asks if it is 'normal to just turn the city over to those kinds of people'; most serious assaults took place near Central Park South, where officers witnesses say police had clear view of mobs that attacked and stripped women, includine one who ran naked to police scooter; Rita Berlin describes pushing through drunken crowds to get to work that afternoon, saying it was worst day she has ever seen in New York (L)

VDown in the hold, beneath the deck boards, where we were denied most of the sun's light but none of its fire, it sometimes seemed as if there were nothing but eyes. The boat was 23 feet long, powered solely by two small sails. There were 41 people below and 5 above. All but myself and a photographer were Haitian citizens fleeing their country, hoping to start a new life in the United States. The hold was lined with scrap wood and framed with hand-hewn joists, as in an old mine tunnel, and when I looked into the darkness it was impossible to tell where one person ended and another began. We were compressed together, limbs entangled, heads upon laps, a mass so dense there was scarcely room for motion. Conversation had all but ceased. If not for the shifting and blinking of eyes there'd be little sign that anyone was alive. Twenty hours before, the faces of the people around me seemed bright with the prospect of reaching a new country. Now, as the arduousness of the crossing became clear, their stares conveyed the flat helplessness of fear. David, whose journey I had followed from his hometown of Port-au-Prince, buried his head in his hands. He hadn't moved for hours. ''I'm thinking of someplace else,'' is all he would reveal. Stephen, who had helped round up the passengers, looked anxiously out the hold's square opening, four feet over our heads, where he could see a corner of the sail and a strip of cloudless sky. ''I can't swim,'' he admitted softly. Kenton, a 13-year-old boy, sat in a puddle of vomit and trembled as though crying, only there were no tears. I was concerned about the severity of Kenton's dehydration and could not shake the thought that he wasn't going to make it. ''Some people get to America, and some people die,'' David had said. ''Me, I'll take either one. I'm just not taking Haiti anymore.''

VThe murder rate is up 6 percent. The Wendy's killings and a spate of livery-cab driver murders have revived a long-dormant image of a dangerous New York. And here and there, when New Yorkers talk about crime and remember the bad old days, many have come to assume that a police force tired of pay disparity, relentless pressure to produce and public second-guessing has grown sluggish. The impression of arms-folded indifference by the police was reinforced last weekend when, in a city where the tiniest crimes have long been vigorously pursued, dozens of women were sexually assaulted in the environs of an event, the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, that was being patrolled by 4,000 officers.

VA giant skull with red lasers shooting out of its eyes slowly descended from the top of the stage until it hovered over the audience of 20,000 people at Arrowhead Pond here on Friday night. Its bone-white teeth clattered open and shut, as an evil laugh reverberated through the arena. Then flash pots exploded, the sounds of a thunderstorm pealed through the air and -- who emerged onstage? Was it Metallica? Iron Maiden? No, it was Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg. The era of arena rap is upon us. This week what may be the slickest, largest-scale, most professional and most punctual rap tour to date kicked off in California. Full of spectacular light displays, elaborate sets and expensive short films, it had all the pomp and eye candy of a Pink Floyd concert. Billed as the Up in Smoke tour, it featured, besides Dr. Dre and Snoop, Ice Cube, Eminem and an extremely brief reunion by N.W.A., the pioneering gangsta rap band that included Dre and Cube.

VThe first time that George W. Bush was arrested, he had just stolen a Christmas wreath. Mr. Bush, then a 20-year-old junior at Yale, was head of a notoriously rambunctious fraternity, and with the Christmas holidays approaching, he and some of his buddies had declared themselves the ''decorating committee.'' They took off for a festive shopping street, where Mr. Bush spotted the wreath in a hotel -- and stole it.

VSpecial report, Governor Bush's Journey, examines journey of George W Bush through counterculture upheaval of late 1960's when he was student at Yale; he remained noncombatant during years at Yale, when pressed to take sides in great battles unfloding over politics, civil rights, drugs and music; when forced to choose, he ultimately retreated to values and ideals established by his parents' generation, and to their accepted methods of rebelling; while many young people of privilege who encountered 1960's began to question system and their own values, Bush seems to have grasped his more tightly than ever; he never questioned the law, and much of his current underlying political philosophy rests on belief that nation still needs to reverse psychology of permissiveness and liberalism that began to take root in country in late 1960's; he was rabble-rouser of sorts, but only in high-spirited way that fraternity members generation earlier swallowed goldfish or sat on flagpoles; photos (L)

VIn the current debate over the death penalty, the focus has been largely on the states, primarily Illinois, whose governor has declared a moratorium, and Texas, which puts more inmates to death than most countries and whose governor, of course, is running for president. This has allowed the Clinton administration to remain largely above the fray because there has not been a federal execution in nearly 40 years. Although Vice President Al Gore favors the death penalty, he has not faced the tough questioning that Gov. George W. Bush has, and Mr. Gore has said little other than that he does not see the need for a federal moratorium.

VDR. JAMES VARGA, a pediatrician, has been in practice in Santa Monica, Calif., for 21 years, enough time for a generation of well-educated, middle- and upper-middle-class parents to have visited his examination room with their children. His diagnosis of those parents: ''Absolutely too permissive.'' The syndrome, according to Dr. Varga, starts with sleep problems, when the child is 9 to 12 months old. Then comes the tantrums when the child is 2 or 3. By adolescence, it is drugs and alcohol. ''People are not setting limits,'' he said.

VSOME of us in the social commentary business have spent the better part of their 40's mocking a certain type of person out here in suburbia. You know who I'm talking about, of course: the kind who pays extra for distressed jeans with holes in them, gives their children Rolodexes for Christmas and actually understands the menu at Starbucks. For lack of a better term, we might have called them Yuppies, or post-Yuppies. Sometimes we called them Boomers, and sometimes we just described the era -- throwing in knowing references to ''fin de siecle'' America, as if it was going out of style.

VEach time a police cruiser passed, someone in the game room screamed a curse. Mother this, mother that, on and on. They cranked the rap music to seismic levels, as if the lyrics -- something about ''cracker cops'' -- might make the police leave them alone. But still, the cruisers came. And then an unmarked Taurus went by. And then a police van with four officers passed. It was driving the teenagers nuts. They said they felt like ghetto lab rats. The night before, officers had raided the game room, a dim, grungy hole of a place on the edge of the Van Dyke projects in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Hunting for drugs, the officers had smashed open the pool table, and Qyntel Smith, 19, said she had been hit by pepper spray.

VTHERE is a barely perceptible, almost wistful, longing for the time when his practice largely consisted of curing childhood diseases. Measles, mumps, chicken pox -- these were definable ailments that would likely go away with proper treatment. Now, Dr. Jack Swanson, a pediatrician in Ames, Iowa, spends his days dealing with more elusive problems: depressed children, anorexic and bulimic teenagers, sexually precocious tweens, young substance abusers, younger perpetrators and victims of violence. In the heartland, on the East Coast and the West, America's 55,000 pediatricians are no longer just baby doctors dispensing inoculations, cough syrups and bromides. They have become de facto psychiatrists and subspecialists. They are child welfare advocates, conduits to other social services and navigators of byzantine H.M.O.'s. They are trench warriors in the battle against the ''new morbidity.''

VPeter McWilliams, a best-selling author of self-help books who fought for the medicinal use of marijuana, died June 14 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 50 and had AIDS and AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Mr. McWilliams caught the crest of the wave of the personal-computer revolution with his highly successful ''The Word Processing Book: A Short Course in Computer Literacy'' (Prelude Press, 1982). But he gained attention in recent years by advocating, in print and in court, the legalization of marijuana.

VA veteran police officer was suspended early yesterday morning for failing to assist a teenager who told her he had been sexually abused in Greenwich Village after the annual Gay and Lesbian Pride March, the authorities said. The immediate suspension of the officer, Donna Gaudino, came as the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau was completing its investigation into reports that officers had failed to help women who said they were attacked in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11. This latest incident was different in that the teenager making the complaint immediately pointed out Officer Gaudino.

VPresident Clinton turned an hourlong news conference today into an effort to bolster Vice President Al Gore's campaign and to defend him from accusations of campaign finance irregularities. He said Mr. Gore made ''a compelling case'' that he did nothing wrong and argued that the ''so-called scandals'' of the last eight years ''were bogus.'' In a wide-ranging discussion that included gasoline prices, the death penalty, missile defense, Elian Gonzalez, prescription drug coverage and how much brain power it takes to be president, Mr. Clinton invoked Mr. Gore's name more than a dozen times.

VFIVE years ago, search engines seemed like the Web's salvation. Today, they need some saviors of their own. When search engines first appeared, they were hailed for accomplishing two things that could not be done by people on any large scale: Search engines use software agents to find and index sites almost as soon as they appeared. And they could almost instantaneously match a far-flung Web page with a single keyword typed into a beckoning search box.

VHere it is, the biggest party of the year, and they cluster together off to the side: the members of the chess team, the guys from the audiovisual club, future physics majors with thick glasses and pocket protectors. Just what are they doing in this room full of quarterbacks and cheerleaders? Who invited them to the party? Every summer, the major Hollywood studios unleash their biggest, loudest and most expensive and star-studded films into a world of vacationing families and entertainment-hungry teenagers. Tom Cruise hangs from impossible cliffs. Mel Gibson skewers sneering Brits. Jim Carrey rides the wild highway. The rules are simple: cars exist to be chased, guns to be fired, affairs to be consummated, rockets to be launched. Special effects blossom like wildflowers on the prairie. Have sequel, will travel.

VNot long ago, Caffe Giannini in Ridgewood, Queens, was the sort of place where a customer could sit for hours at one of the round marble tables, drinking cappuccino brewed on the antique brass espresso machine. But according to federal agents, the tiny thriving storefront cafe did more than serve good coffee, cannoli and mozzarella sandwiches to its clientele. It also served, they said, as the clubhouse for an exceptionally violent group of neighborhood toughs who performed a vast array of dirty business for the mob.

VTo the Editor: It is unclear what fresh insight we are meant to gain from your June 25 front-page report (''View From New York Streets: No Retreat by Police'') that adolescent men who congregate on the street to smoke marijuana and drink alcohol harbor animosity toward the police who arrest them for it. Their intense dislike of law enforcement probably comes from an intersection of factors: that adolescent males are known to question authority, that popular music and culture reflect and compound this dislike and that they seem to enjoy doing something that is at the present time illegal.

VFive years after the Clinton administration and the Republican-led Congress began an enormous law enforcement buildup along the Mexican border to fight the war on drugs and illegal immigration, federal and state courts are buckling under the strain of the resulting criminal caseload. The unprecedented numbers of new drug and immigration indictments are inundating the five federal judicial districts along the nearly 2,000-mile border that stretches from the mouth of the Rio Grande in Texas to San Diego. Those now handle 26 percent of all federal criminal filings in the United States. The remaining 74 percent is spread among the country's 89 other district courts.

VTall and lanky, with a voice that occasionally cracks and a forelock that resists conformity. All in all, he presents himself as the perfect young man to escort your daughter to the junior prom: he would obey the speed limit, attempt nothing more than a peck on the cheek, and studiously avoid the rum raisin ice cream for dessert. But Rick A. Lazio is 42 years old, not 18. Despite the gee-whiz air about him, he is old enough to have a wife, two daughters and a weekend beach house; eight years as a Republican congressman; and the brash self-confidence to square off against Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York's high-wattage race for the United States Senate.

VSpecial report, A Growing Ambition, profiles Repr Rick A Lazio, Republican nominee in contest against Hillary Rodham Clinton for US Senate seat from New York; advisers have warned Clinton that in many ways he represents more of challenge than former candidate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; he has palpable ambition that infuses him with energy, gift for negotiation and rare ability to connect across wide spectrum of voters; promotes himself in calculating way that unnerves colleagues; is well-known for waiting until last moment to cast votes in Congress--tactic supporters say reflects deliberate approach to lawmaking but criticized by detractors as showing penchant for pandering to Republican leadership; although considered moderate Repuiblican, his positions on major issues seem carefully nuanced; photos (L)

VMy two Rhodesian Ridgebacks were only vaguely attentive as I tried to explain to them that some dogs actually work for a living. Canines that can hold their heads high as they approach their supper dishes. Animals whose vet bills could be a tax-deductible expense for their owners. My dogs yawned as their attention drifted to a chattering squirrel. They gave me their how-long-until-we-are-fed look and wandered deeper into the backyard.

VIn the dying light, the prayers for the missing woman poured out of the hilltop church near Montego Bay, two hours' drive from this beach resort town. Frederick and Mary Ann Kirschhoch stood up beneath whirring fans. The Moravian congregation was asking God for the safe return of the couple's daughter, Claudia, 29, a travel editor for Frommer's who vanished from Negril around May 27.

VDespite his dignified pose and his made-to-order double-breasted suits, Warren Christopher goes virtually unnoticed as he makes his way these days, always unescorted, to the offices of Democratic governors, members of Congress and well-known party members no longer in government. Discretion is what Christopher is about: in his meetings with very important Democrats, aides know to leave the room, and the conversations are off the record. No tape recorder. No entourage. No small talk. Christopher, who is 74, has devoted much of his career to ticklish sub rosa missions. He negotiated the release of American hostages from Iran in 1981. He headed the commission that recommended sweeping changes in the Los Angeles Police Department after the beating of Rodney King. As President Clinton's secretary of state, he drew up a plan for sending American troops into the Balkans. Now Vice President Al Gore has dispatched Christopher on what is, in its way, one of the most challenging assignments he has ever taken on: to sort through the weakest Democratic field in modern memory and find the few men or women who could be a next vice president of the United States -- in short, to create the List. Because there is a lack of obvious candidates, Christopher's task is a far more formidable one than he faced eight years ago, when he oversaw Clinton's search for those who might make a vice president. Of course, that means Gore's ultimate choice is harder than Clinton's was. And yet there may be no more consequential decision for Gore: after what seem like interminable reinventions and remakes, the vice president is still struggling to ignite his campaign. It may be that the only way Gore can win in November is if he successfully reintroduces himself at the party's convention in Los Angeles next month. That can only happen if he picks the right running mate.

V''SIXTEEN kids become smokers every day in Suffolk County,'' said Ginny Fields, a Democratic legislator who is chairwoman of the county's health committee, and she is determined to stop this trend with legislation that imposes fines and mandates community service in hospices for any teenager found buying or using tobacco. ''We already have laws that say vendors can't sell tobacco to minors and that kids can't drink or drive until they're a certain age, and that people have to use seat belts and they can't go over the speed limit,'' Ms. Fields said. ''Look how many lives these laws have saved.''

VStockwell Day, the new leader of Canada's opposition going into elections expected next spring, offers a conservative face rarely associated with Canadian politicians: support for a flat income tax, tougher sentencing for criminals and beefed up military spending. But his sudden sweep to national prominence, culminating with his decisive election Saturday night as leader of the new Canadian Alliance Party, seems vaguely familiar, leading some commentators to call him the Pierre Trudeau of the right.

VThe continuing Up in Smoke tour, featuring the rap superstars Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Cube and Nate Dogg, was supposed to clean up rap's reputation for attracting violence at concerts and other live events. The promoters hired a crew with experience on Kiss, Pink Floyd and Aerosmith tours and booked more than two solid months of dates in major arenas across the country. So far, the concerts have been punctual, professional and attended by all of the headliners, the tour's promoters say. Musically and visually, the tour -- full of explosions, elaborate sets, and videos -- has set a new standard for live rap spectacles. It has also managed to avoid the audience flare-ups that have given other rap shows play on police radios. By all accounts, it will be among the highest grossing tours of the year.

VFew cities in Europe feel as laid back as Amsterdam, with its preference for pedestrians and bikes, its outdoor cafes and easygoing policies on drugs and sex. But amid the strollers are more than flower children. Pickpockets and bag snatchers thrive precisely because people seem so much at ease and distracted. They operate of course where most of the tourists are: the tram lines (especially Nos. 1, 2 and 5), which go to the main museums; on the train connecting Schiphol Airport and the city; in and around the Central Station, and at waiting lines for tour boats or ferries. Groups of two or three young people are likely to use a classic technique: one asks for directions, while another reaches for your bag or backpack.

VDr. Dre, the producer and rapper who made gangsta rap an enduring commercial force, has put his testosterone fantasies onstage with the Up in Smoke tour, which came to the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on Saturday night and is due at Nassau Coliseum on Wednesday. The tour features the multimillion-selling rappers Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Ice Cube along with Dr. Dre, and it is one of hip-hop's most elaborate spectacles to date. The East Rutherford show moved efficiently through a nearly four-hour production involving multiple backdrops, blasts of flame, video clips, a giant talking skull and a purple low-rider convertible. A comedian, Alex Taylor, worked the crowd during set changes.

VREVELATIONS about Rudolph W. Giuliani's family and friends are the juicy parts, and they certainly are intriguing. But for us policy nuts, one of the new biographies of the mayor raises even more compelling questions about the startling drop in the city's crime rate. In a dizzyingly complex chapter, Wayne Barrett, the author of ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani'' (Basic Books), examines everything from who should get the credit to whether City Hall has massaged the statistics. We leave the numbers to the statisticians; suffice it to say that while the mayor puts a self-referential emphasis on the positive, the city is safer now than it was a decade ago.

VDr. David C. Sands holds out a clear plastic petri dish filled with a white fuzzy fungus growing across the bottom. This substance, he believes, is the key to ending much of the world's production of illicit drugs. Members of Congress also believe that Dr. Sands and other researchers may be on to a powerful and environmentally safe method of killing not only coca plants, but also marijuana and poppy plants. The members have asked the government of Colombia to test a strain of Fusarium oxysporum over the next two years. If it proves effective, the disease will be sprayed on vast fields of coca plants there, and experts say it could wipe out much of the coca crop within a year.

VSeriously ill patients with no alternative but marijuana to alleviate their conditions will now be able to obtain the drug legally from a group in Oakland, Calif., a federal judge ruled today. Modifying an order that shut down several marijuana clubs two years ago, Judge Charles R. Breyer of Federal District Court has given the group, the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, a green light to distribute marijuana to patients who meet certain requirements: They must have a serious medical condition; they will suffer imminent harm without marijuana; and they have no legal alternative to marijuana for effective treatment.

VFor more than three months, Kevin Meeker, owner of Philadelphia Fish and Company, a restaurant and bar, put up with a cook whose obsession with the stock market often took his mind away from the soup. The 22-year-old employee checked his Motorola shares every half-hour on his pager and periodically slipped out to the dining room to get the bartender to turn on CNBC. Not so long ago, Mr. Meeker says, he would have warned the cook to knock it off and fired him if he did not comply. But not in this job market. Instead, he turned a blind eye to the goofing off, and says he would probably still have the man on the payroll if he had not quit on Mother's Day after being asked to work beyond his eight-hour shift.

VKareem Abdul-Jabbar, the National Basketball Association's career scoring leader, was arrested Tuesday for investigation of driving under the influence of marijuana, the Los Angeles police said. Abdul-Jabbar, the former Los Angeles Lakers and U.C.L.A. star, was arrested about 7 p.m. after a police officer who pulled him over for speeding smelled marijuana fumes from the open window of his car, said Officer Eduardo Funes, a police spokesman.

VAMERICAN RHAPSODY By Joe Eszterhas 432 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95. At last we have concrete evidence that during the events leading up to President Clinton's impeachment trial, the level of national discourse really did reach the level of a Joe Eszterhas movie. Because in his new book, Mr. Eszterhas, author of the award-winning ''Showgirls'' (jacket copy cites its Sour Apple Award from the Hollywood Women's Press Association) has brought his screenwriting skills to bear upon imagining the deepest, darkest, sudsiest thoughts of this scandalous story's major and bit players. Harry Potter is the rare contemporary celebrity whose sex life does not come under lascivious scrutiny here.

VThe Beach An American tourist named Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio, left) alights in Thailand, where he knocks down jiggers of snake blood and persuades two French contemporaries (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) to help him find the perfect beach. On the way they narrowly escape being machine-gunned by marijuana farmers before encountering a pod of like-minded Western hedonists living communally in ''paradise.'' But while Danny Boyle's film has surface tension, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, ''all of Mr. DiCaprio's charisma and the director's savvy are used to divert us from the fact that there's not much going on.'' 2000. Fox. $107.37; DVD, $34.98. 120 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: July 25.

VGlasses of white wine and cups of ice-cold draft beer, two thirst-quenching staples of summer festivals, could soon become memories of days gone by on the streets of New York, as the Giuliani administration is considering banning the sale of alcohol at outdoor street parties. If the administration follows through with its plan, the ban will turn all manner of outdoor feasts -- from the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy to the Ninth Avenue Food Festival in Clinton -- into nonalcoholic affairs, parties at which sausage-and-pepper sandwiches and clams on the half shell would be washed down with soda, lemonade or bottled water. Violators would be ticketed under the city's open container law.

VTHE tobacco industry is facing a nearly $145 billion penalty after a jury in Florida decided earlier this month that cigarette makers had known for decades that their product causes deadly cancers. Kerry Lane, a doctor in Del Ray Beach, Fla., says industry scientists have also known for much of that time that it was possible to prepare cigarettes that would not cause so many deaths. But they didn't pursue the evidence, he said, so he did. And he has now won a patent for a process that he contends will make cigarettes safer.

VDURING Prohibition, Americans rowed across the Detroit River to this border city to buy whisky. A generation later, young people drove across the river to buy marijuana. But today, the border contraband run is to score a different kind of Canadian pot, one that gives a different kind of thrill -- the forbidden flush. ''Why do I need the government to tell me what kind of toilet to buy?'' Linda Walton, a visiting American, asked one hot Saturday morning after her husband, Tony, wrestled three 3.5-gallon-capacity toilets into their van.

In a news conference on the latest review of evidence, which itself took two years, federal prosecutors ridiculed suggestions that the prelate was the target of a conspiracy, and they stood by the conclusion of the initial investigation.

VImagine a country, a democracy, with a domestic program that is increasingly costly and socially disruptive. The problem it is supposed to solve has actually grown worse over the years -- but neither major political party will talk about changing the policy. That is a picture of the United States and its drug policy. By any rational test the war on drugs, with its use of the criminal law and harsh sentences to solve the problem, is a costly failure. The number of Americans in prison for drug offenses has multiplied by 10 since 1980, from 41,000 to 458,000. But drugs are more available than ever, and more young people are using them.

VAnthony Lewis Op-Ed article says America's war on drugs, with its use of criminal law and harsh sentences to solve problem, is costly failure, but neither Democrats nor Republicans are addressing issue this election year, or even discussing different approaches that might get them labeled as soft on drugs; says fact is that 10 times as many Americans are in prison for drug offenses today as in 1980, and blacks are overwhelmingly more likely than whites to be imprisoned for drug offenses; applauds Arianna Huffington, who has organized shadow conventions to coincide with Democratic and Republican conventions, to discuss failed war on drugs and other controversial issues major parties are ignoring (M)

VKenneth Gregorio and Brian Juliano did not fit the profile of the street-hardened drug dealer. As a criminal justice major at nearby Monmouth University, Mr. Juliano knew he and his classmate were in deep trouble on Saturday night when law enforcement officials charged them with the possession and intended sale of 49,000 tablets of Ecstasy, the dance-club drug that has become increasingly popular with young suburbanites. Just a few hours after the students were taken to the Neptune Police Station in handcuffs, Mr. Gregorio, 23, a communications major, was found dead in his cell. He had hanged himself with the drawstring from his sweat pants, the police said.

VThe rulers of Britain may have embarked on an aggressive campaign of modernization -- what with the Millennium Dome, the transformation of the House of Lords and all that throbbing techno music -- but a segment of the entertainment industry remains stubbornly wedded to ancient notions of the British character. The once-mighty empire remains, if recent movies are to be believed, a nation of absent-minded vicars, codgers and goosey, tea-swilling ladies who populate cozy crofts and seaside villages and manufacture eccentricity for the export market. ''Saving Grace,'' which tries to do for marijuana-dealing what ''The Full Monty'' did for male striptease, is this summer's bait for the Anglophiles who keep shows like ''Mr. Bean'' and ''Keeping Up Appearances'' running on public television. Though it might be described as a BBC sitcom as imagined by Cheech and Chong, ''Saving Grace,'' directed by Nigel Cole, springs from the imagination of Craig Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson wrote the screenplay with Mark Crowdy and helped to produce the picture, in which he also stars.

VNEW movies come in on waves of hype and anticipation, followed, if they're lucky, by swelling word of mouth. When the waves recede, they leave behind something tangible: soundtrack albums. If summer is a prime time for movie releases, it's also a good time to look back over recent albums, some of which are better than the movies themselves. Soundtrack albums share a title with a movie, and they're often marketed as souvenirs, a way to jog memories of a beloved story or character before the video comes out. Those albums holding a movie's instrumental score are released on the assumption that people will want music they associate with, say, ''Titanic,'' to accompany their own love stories.

VEvery other week, it seems, the authorities convene another news conference to announce another sweep, another bust, another gigantic distribution network crushed. Stick your head out the window these days and you cannot help hearing about Ecstasy. Seizures of the little white pills have occurred so often in recent months that it is beginning to feel as if law enforcement officials are doing little else besides cracking down on the drug. Mafia turncoats are charged with moving it in Arizona. Israeli mobsters are caught distributing it in Brooklyn. Even New Jersey college students are rounded up on quiet campuses, accused of selling it to their peers.

VON a glowing mid-July evening at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Derek Pedersen, 11, was settling in to enjoy his first rock concert. Waiting for the show to start, he leaned shyly on the shoulder of his mother, Leslie Pedersen, 43. But later, as the Dave Matthews Band took the stage and built to a crescendo of rhythmic guitar and violin, he climbed aboard his 21-year-old sister's shoulders, threw his arms into the air and swayed rhapsodically with the rest of the crowd. A few rows back, Emily and Glenn Blair, an obstetrician and podiatrist, from Easton, Conn., were enjoying a similar musical communion with their daughters, Madeline, 8, and Hillary, 15. Although dressed as country club stalwarts -- he with linen shorts and loafers, she with pearls -- they are rock concert regulars. This was the third Dave Matthews concert the family had attended. Enjoying the jazzy, soulful improvisations that have made the band a favorite among today's college undergraduates is a bonding activity, the Blairs say. ''On the way home in the car, we discuss our favorite guitar riffs,'' Mr. Blair said.

VIn one of his last official visits here as the United States director of drug policy, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, praised the transition team of President-elect Vicente Fox and said he shared Mr. Fox's opposition to the American drug-certification program. But General McCaffrey, who has long expressed misgivings about the program, said there was no chance that Congress would end it in the near future. ''Zero,'' he said, to a question at a news briefing. At most, he said, the program might die a kind of natural death as the Organization of American States begins drawing up plans next year for multinational drug evaluation that would open all member governments' drug programs to scrutiny.

VMichael Ouellette lives in an illegal room in Manhattan. His cell-like home of 8 feet by 13 feet has no window for light and air, as required by New York City statute. Two other rented rooms are also windowless, and he disputes the legality of three more. Missing windows are not the only problem. In fact, Mr. Ouellette contends that the whole building is operating outside the law. There is no certificate of occupancy, a required city document authorizing the use of a building. And in June, a city buildings inspector issued a ''hazardous violation'' citing the property as an illegal single-room-occupancy hotel.

VThe adaptability, elasticity even, of Gilbert and Sullivan is in evidence in Manhattan these days as two groups present nontraditional versions of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and ''The Pirates of Penzance.'' AT the end of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' by Gilbert and Sullivan, the pirates abandon their criminal ways out of their love for Queen Victoria. In the Gorilla Repertory Theater Company's adaptation, the show ends with the pirates seizing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, chanting, ''Do your duty, down with Rudy,'' and throwing him overboard.

VTHERE are now official surveys to confirm that tourists are taking over New York City. With a population approaching nine million, the city played host to about four tourists per resident last year, according to federal surveys and tourist research announced by city officials last week. The figures pushed New York up into second place for tourist destinations in the United States, bested only by Orlando, Fla., home of Disney World.

VFour years ago, Neil Walker missed a spot on the United States Olympic swimming team by one-hundredth of a second, a margin so small that it inevitably produced disappointment that was huge and inconsolable. In the Olympic trials tonight, Walker churned out of the blocks at world-record pace in the 100-meter freestyle and, while he could not maintain the searing sprint, he did hold off Gary Hall Jr. to win in 48.71 seconds and finally qualify for an individual event at the Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia.

The 28-year-old former Texas Tech star pleaded guilty to two of four counts of a federal indictment. He admitted to attempting to distribute more than 220 pounds of marijuana in the Kansas City area between Jan. 1, 1998, and May 10, 2000.

VThe 50-meter freestyle is the most elemental of all swimming races, the closest thing to a track sprint, a crouched start, a frothing slice of arms, an urgent white-water finish. Most of the time, there is room to breathe only once. When he reached the wall first in a foaming rush tonight, Gary Hall Jr. had set an American record of 21.76 seconds and had rejuvenated a career that had been smudged since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics by a marijuana-related suspension and had been threatened by diabetes.

VNEW YORK MANHATTAN: CHARGES DROPPED IN CONCRETE ATTACK A Manhattan judge yesterday formally dropped charges against Bently Louis Grant, 35, a homeless man charged with attacking a woman last month with a chunk of concrete. The police had said that Mr. Grant confessed. Security videotapes, however, showed that he was at a Manhattan record store at the time of the attack. On Wednesday, Mr. Grant, who has been treated for mental illness, was moved to an apartment with the help of psychiatric social workers at Elmhurst Medical Center, where he received care after being released from jail.

VWhen the Oxford English Dictionary decided to open a North American office this year to document the evolution of American English from the thick of it, it engaged a young American lexicographer with impeccable credentials who also happened to be the author of a 288-page book on a certain unmentionable word. Jesse Sheidlower, known far beyond the anonymous world of dictionary-making as an energetic and accessible expert on neologisms and slang, now sits ensconced in a building in Old Saybrook, Conn., which the O.E.D. shares with a hearing-aid company and a dentist, and toils over how best to define terms like ''McMansion,'' ''chowhound'' and ''jiggy.'' (As in ''gettin' jiggy wit' it.'')

VTHERE is no question that Rob Pace did something reckless. A college-bound honor society student with an arrest for marijuana possession in his recent past, Mr. Pace, 18, went on a class trip to Great Adventure amusement park in April carrying drugs in his backpack. Arrested at the gate, he was processed and released by the police in Jackson Township, N.J., but Riverhead High School officials refused to bring him home to Long Island. A school official told the police: ''He's 18. He can do what he wants.''

VOn a balmy night in Albuquerque, 80 homeowners shuffle into the cafeteria at Whittier Elementary School, where one wall is covered with a mural that suggests a stage. Standing before this ''stage'' is New Mexico's governor, Gary Johnson, a lithe, boyish figure in a checked blazer and clashing patterned tie. If you saw the sandy-haired, 47-year-old in a crowd, you wouldn't pick him out as a leader. But then he begins. There's no comic introductory patter. He's right into his sermon. ''I made you all a pledge that I was going to put the issues that should be on the front burner on the front burner, regardless of the consequences,'' he says. ''Half of what we spend on law enforcement, half of what we spend on the courts and half of what we spend on the prisons is drug related. Our current policies on drugs are perhaps the biggest problem that this country has.''

VPOLICE officers searching for cocaine engaged in unconstitutional and illegal activity during an early-morning raid of a Peekskill home 15 months ago, the residents of the home are claiming in a lawsuit filed in federal court here. The residents' lawyer, John J. Grimes of Chappaqua, said Sheila James and her family were mistreated by a dozen officers who stormed their John Street home on May 8, 1999, with guns drawn, handcuffed them, ransacked the apartment and left without formally charging anyone.

VTHE young lawyer had just been fired from his first job for being a troublemaker -- in 1968, preaching union to fellow Legal Aid lawyers was a no-no -- when the stranger telephoned. The caller was facing two criminal cases in Chicago, he said, and one from the Columbia student strike. ''I have a doctor and a dentist,'' Abbie Hoffman, the antiwar leader and political stunt master, told Gerald B. Lefcourt, ''but what I really need is a lawyer.''

VSheer niceness is not a quality you expect to find in a rock concert film. But niceness is precisely the ambience of ''Bittersweet Motel,'' Todd Phillips's bland, unrevealing documentary of the hugely popular cult band Phish on tour in 1998. This rock quartet is one band for whom the standard equation of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll hardly applies. Instead of sex, think hugs and naked fans innocently romping outdoors. Instead of drugs, think soy milk strained through homemade oatmeal cookies. Or the Grateful Dead with the mystical psychedelic burners turned on low.

VA selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. The ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 7. Now Playing ''AUTUMN IN NEW YORK,'' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder. Directed by Joan Chen (PG-13, 105 minutes). In this embarrassing 1940's-style weepie, Mr. Gere is a superstar Manhattan chef and ''older man,'' a la Cary Grant, and Ms. Ryder the kooky, doe-eyed 22-year-old hat designer who reforms him. Oh yes, she happens to be dying of a rare heart disease and has only a year to live. It isn't the actors' fault that this oil-and-water mixture of 40's suds (Ms. Ryder's character grows more ethereally beautiful the sicker she gets) and millennial sexual angst doesn't jell (Stephen Holden).

VA 17-year-old was arrested yesterday afternoon and accused of igniting a Brooklyn stable fire in June that killed 21 horses and sent 30-foot flames soaring into the night sky, the police said. The suspect, Frank Esposito, was charged with arson, reckless endangerment, 21 counts of animal cruelty, and marijuana possession, the police said, adding that the fire apparently started while he was smoking marijuana. According to a statement he made to the police, Mr. Esposito stopped by the century-old Bergen Beach Stables in Mill Basin on June 10 to have a smoke, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. It was a muggy Saturday night, and as Mr. Esposito puffed away, he ignited a clump of hay and ''watched it for his amusement,'' Detective Pentangelo said.

VAs Canada's health department looks this fall for a reliable supplier of almost one million marijuana cigarettes for clinical trials, some Canadians say they need to look no farther than ''British Colombia,'' where relaxed attitudes about smoking marijuana have helped turn the province into a major North American producer for some of the drug's strongest strains. While Mexicans can grow bales of the stuff on plantations, cold weather Canadians have genetically tweaked their indoor plants to reach potencies of 10 times the levels of the Woodstock-era grass, putting it on a par with prized Jamaican weed.

VThe use of illegal drugs by youths aged 12 to 17 dropped sharply from 1997 to 1999, the federal government said today. And while drug use among people 18 to 25 went up, it was still far below what it had been 20 years ago. The trend among those 12 to 17 is the most important finding of the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, said Dr. Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, and Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the White House office on drug control policy.

''I'm an odd, quirky choice,'' he told a group of writers last week by telephone. ''It gives you something to write about. If I don't work out, you'll be like wildebeests on the Serengeti. It'll be your fall feeding feast.''

A pretty 17-year-old with smiling eyes and elegantly braided hair, she was intelligent and polite and seemed likely to do well after graduation. They were shocked, therefore, when they heard last week that Ms. Farmer had been charged with helping to commit one of the most senseless murders this city has seen in years.

VTHE INTEREST GROUPS ATTACKING BUSH ON GUNS -- Handgun Control Inc., a nonprofit lobbying group, will begin running a television advertisement in five swing states on Wednesday that sharply criticizes Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Handgun Control plans to spend more than $1 million on the effort, the largest in its history, said Joe Sudbay, the organization's political director. Mr. Sudbay said the commercial would initially run in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and St. Louis, the largest cities in five of the most closely contested states. The 30-second spot, which is similar to one the group ran earlier, says Mr. Bush signed laws that allow Texans to carry concealed handguns. It then cuts to Kayne Robinson, first vice president of the National Rifle Association, saying that if Mr. Bush wins, ''We'll have a president where we work out of their office.''

VOn a cold night last December, a white limousine stopped near Il Boschetto restaurant in Yonkers. Two large men stepped out and hurried through the restaurant's front door. Both men were suspected of being mob racketeers. One, Joseph Datello, has been identified as an inducted member of the Lucchese crime family. The other, Sean J. Richard, was the son-in-law of John Riggi, the imprisoned boss of the New Jersey-based DeCavalcantes. Mr. Richard had recently been in a car accident. He wore a bandage on his left arm.

VSean J Richard, son-in-law of imprisoned New Jersey mob boss John Riggi, is mob's latest embarrassing tell-all turncoat and key figure in indictments accusing Steven L Crea, Joseph Datello and 37 others with participating in a criminal enterprise that drove up price of construction projects throughout New York City; Richard says fear of jail time or death inspired decision to record conversation with Crea, accused Lucchese boss, and Datello about bribery and extortion; Richard is eager to testify about how Luccheses used persistence and payoffs to maintain grip on construction projects at time when Mafia was supposedly in decline; dozens of contractors, union officials and mobsters are said to be vulnerable to account that will detail bribes, coercion and Mafia's aggressive if somewhat bumbling management of sprawling scheme; Richard displays almost glowing disrespect, describing his brother-in-law Emmanuel Riggi as so fat he breaks chairs and Datello as 'big idiot, like Frankenstein'; Bronx-born Richard, 35, was unknown laborer until he married Sara M Riggi in 1996 and took up family business enthusiastically; photos; high life unraveled in June when police raided mob sites in tristate area; Richard is now in hiding with girlfriend; Sara Riggi, with two daughters, has filed for bankruptcy and divorce (M)

VA federal judge in San Francisco ruled today that federal officials may not interfere with the freedom of California doctors and patients to discuss the potential medical benefits of marijuana, or of doctors to recommend its therapeutic use, under the terms of a state ballot initiative approved by voters in 1996. The ruling by Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court came in a class-action lawsuit filed against top Clinton administration officials, including Attorney General Janet Reno, in 1997, seeking to block them from prosecuting or removing the prescription licenses of any doctors who endorsed marijuana's potential benefits in treating patients with painful illnesses like AIDS and cancer.

VA selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 8. Now Playing ''AUTUMN IN NEW YORK,'' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder. Directed by Joan Chen (PG-13, 105 minutes). In this embarrassing 1940's-style weepie, Mr. Gere is a superstar Manhattan chef and ''older man,'' a la Cary Grant, and Ms. Ryder the kooky, doe-eyed 22-year-old hat designer who reforms him. Oh yes, she happens to be dying of a rare heart disease and has only a year to live. It isn't the actors' fault that this oil-and-water mixture of 40's suds (Ms. Ryder's character grows more ethereally beautiful the sicker she gets) and millennial sexual angst doesn't jell (Stephen Holden).

VTHE STATES RULING OUT BALLOT MEASURE The Arizona Supreme Court says that a November ballot initiative that would have abolished the state's income tax is unconstitutional and must be stricken from the ballot. The court ruled Thursday without comment on the measure, Proposition 107, which would have phased out income taxes and required voter approval of any new taxes and fees. It also would have provided for identification on future ballots of all candidates for federal office who pledged to eliminate the federal income tax. A written court order on the ruling is to be handed down later. Opponents of the measure contended that it would have violated the requirement that amendments to the state constitution cover only a single subject. They also warned that the measure would have resulted in cutbacks in services from education to prisons. Todd S. Purdum (NYT)

They said that they understood the power of peers, the lure of gangs and drugs, the impact of movies and music and television that with relentless repetition depicted a culture of casual violence. And, they said, they believed they had taken the necessary precautions.

I was warned about this before I went. Unfortunately, I don't own any clothing without logos. Who does? So as an anti-anticommercial statement on my first morning there, I wore an old Creative Artists Agency T-shirt. ''C.A.A!'' a female voice shouted as I biked past her encampment. ''Burn in hell!''

VTHE ocean seemed calm, the voyage promising. Bits of blue peeked from the mist around the spiky green and granite mountains, the geological backbone of the Lofoten Islands of Norway, rising from the water like the spine of some ancient sea creature. The boat was waiting in the Reine harbor, next to a small warehouse where we could see, and smell, stacks of dried cod. We were off to the end of Moskenesoya Island, the final jewel of this archipelago 60 miles north of the Arctic Circle. It was to be a pilgrimage of sorts, a trip back in time to a lonely spot where painted figures some 3,000 years old danced on the walls of a cave.

Here are some responses from , a New York Times online knowledge network. I agree with Governor Johnson's stand for the legalization of marijuana. I personally do not use it, but I have tried it in the past. As far as I'm concerned, the biggest crime it causes is a need for snacks and for long periods of sleep. (kmitchell)

VTHERE IS NO Robin Hood, no William Tell, not even Geena Davis, although the actress, a nationally ranked archer, promises to try again to make the 2004 United States Olympic team. There is no Justin Huish because the flamboyant Californian, a 1996 gold medalist, withdrew after a marijuana arrest. There are no complicated rules, either, just a matter of shooting arrows at a target 70 meters away. THE SETUP -- There are four events -- men's and women's individual and team. In the individual competition, after a round to seed them 1 to 64, the 64 men and 64 women have head-to-head eliminations. In the first three rounds, each archer shoots 18 arrows. In the last three, each shoots 12.

VA selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 8. Now Playing ''BLESS THE CHILD,'' starring Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell and Jimmy Smits. Directed by Chuck Russell (R, 115 minutes). A runny supernatural soap opera -- the first thriller of the ''Touched by an Angel'' era -- that tries for the elegant calm of ''The Sixth Sense'' but fails. It is too often overcome by its flamboyantly cheesy reflexes. Ms. Basinger is the protector aunt of a child (the gifted Holliston Coleman) whose heavenly powers make her the target of an evil cult leader (Mr. Sewell). He means to kill her before Easter; you may feel the need to leave long before then. ''Bless the Child'' seems derivative of so many other movies that you're surprised it doesn't have to credit its sources the way hip-hop artists do when they sample songs. With Mr. Smits as an F.B.I. agent and Ian Holm as a priest who does a laughable steal from ''The Usual Suspects'' (Elvis Mitchell).

VIn the 1980's, in the quiet parish of St. Frances de Chantal in Throgs Neck, the Bronx, Linda Baisi was teaching junior high school. A former nun, she had left the convent and rented an apartment from the parish school secretary. And in that apartment, according to a young man who knew her as teacher and confirmation sponsor, Ms. Baisi carried on a sexual relationship with him from the time he was 12 years old until his sophomore year in high school, later giving him gifts, leaving cash for him in envelopes at the rectory and begging him to keep the encounters a secret.

VFor all the decisions Ross C. Anderson has made in his first year as mayor of Salt Lake City, none has caused a bigger furor than this one: Over the summer, he terminated the city's involvement with the antidrug program in public schools known as DARE, saying that it was ineffective and a poor substitute for programs that he contends do more to discourage drug use by young people. Reaction was swift. While many residents applauded the decision, Mr. Anderson was criticized by parents, teachers, Republicans, even fellow Democrats, including the chairman of the state party, Meg Holbrook, and the Democratic candidate for governor, Bill Orton.

VDARRYL STRAWBERRY, the recovering drug user, cancer survivor and sometime baseball player, was back in the news this week for all the usual reasons. He was in trouble with the law. Mr. Strawberry's troubles came to the attention of a woman in Harlem named Thomasina, who found them of more than passing interest. How could she not? She has fought her own demons over the years, same as the women and men she lives with on East 121st Street, at a drug treatment residence run by Odyssey House.

VPolice Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik is conducting an intensive review of the Police Department's antidrug efforts, focusing on how tens of millions of dollars in overtime are being spent and on the high percentage of minor arrests being made by narcotics detectives, according to several senior law enforcement officials. The officials, who are familiar with Mr. Kerik's review, have said he is concerned that misdemeanor narcotics arrests outnumber felony arrests by three to one, an indication that a large number of people charged with drug crimes serve little or no time in jail.

VWith legal prostitution in the famed Red Light District and marijuana sold openly in the so-called coffee-shops, Amsterdam lives up to its reputation as a freewheeling pleasure capital. Amsterdam is one of Europe's premier club towns, and the Dutch are very serious about house music. Late-night action is centered in the Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein districts, both within walking distance of the city center. With Amsterdam's popular informal ''after parties,'' Saturday night can last well into Sunday morning. Melkweg means Milky Way, an appropriate name for a former dairy factory that now exists as a nonprofit arts venue. Saturday night draws huge dance crowds for dueling D.J.'s, who rule the two ground-floor loft spaces. ''Pop Arena,'' featuring nostalgic tunes from the 80's and 90's, opens at midnight, while Dance Arena, spotlighting jungle/house/trance trends, starts after 1.

VName: Alex Aborlleile Age: 19 Coming from: Philadelphia Looking for: Escape When Alex Aborlleile arrived on a bus from Philadelphia in March, he walked into Port Authority carrying a couple of dollars, a backpack and a bag of oranges. He was 18. A skinny Cuban-American kid with Bambi eyes, he wandered onto Eighth Avenue, merging with the crowd on the sidewalk. Like most new arrivals, he was stunned by his first sight of Midtown Manhattan. ''My mouth was agape,'' he recalls. ''It was huge.'' Alex had no place to stay, no friends, no family. All he had was a plan, the same one he'd been following for almost a year.

VNEW YORK FARMINGVILLE: WORKERS BEATEN -- Two migrant workers were attacked with shovels and knives Sunday morning by two men posing as contractors, the police said. Two white men in Farmingville lured the Mexican men into their station wagon with the promise of work. The workers were driven to an abandoned building in Shirley, N.Y., said Detective Sgt. Robert Reecks, of the Suffolk County Police. The workers, Israel Perez and Magdaleno Escamilla, were then beaten with shovels and Mr. Perez was stabbed repeatedly with a knife. They managed to escape and wave down a motorist. Mr. Perez underwent surgery for a severed tendon in his right hand yesterday, and was listed in stable condition at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital. Charlie LeDuff MANHATTAN: MAYOR CRITICIZES BRATTON -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani warned his former police commissioner, William J. Bratton, left, yesterday to ''stay out of the Republican Party.'' Otherwise, Mr. Giuliani threatened, ''the Republican mayor of New York City will do everything he can to oppose you.'' Mr. Bratton, a registered independent who warred with Mr. Giuliani in the mid-1990's over who should get credit for the city's drop in crime, has been saying he may run for mayor in 2001 as a Republican. The mayor said, ''I think all of the personally nasty things that he's said about me obviously will influence me.'' Mr. Bratton said the mayor's remarks were ''not unanticipated.'' Elisabeth Bumiller

VThe Clinton administration's three-year battle to prevent the use of marijuana as medicine as allowed under California law got a well-deserved rebuke this month. A federal judge wisely ruled that the administration could not punish doctors who recommend the benefits of marijuana to their patients. Such a policy, wrote Judge William Alsup, raises ''severe First Amendment doubts.'' Proposition 215, approved by voters in California in 1996, made it legal for seriously ill patients to obtain and use marijuana when that therapy was recommended by a doctor. Seven other states have since enacted similar measures. Marijuana possession remains illegal under federal drug laws. But the federal government seldom prosecutes medical marijuana users because the quantities are small and juries tend to sympathize with seriously ill individuals. Instead the administration has tried to circumvent the California law by threatening doctors who recommend marijuana with the loss of their federal licenses to prescribe drugs.

VUntil I was 19 years old and, by then, living in New York (which once again celebrates itself as book country this weekend), I had never read a book of serious literature written in the 20th century and I had never read a book of serious literature written by someone who was not English and by that I do not mean someone from Britain. I mean literature written by someone from that place known as England. This wasn't the fault of anyone in particular. No one made a special effort to keep me from Virginia Woolf or E. M. Forster. It is just that I spent the first 16 years of my life on an island in the Caribbean Sea that was a British colony. To us the British Empire was the entire alphabet and in it we were not more than the dot over the common letter i. I grew up in this place in the 1950's. The British Empire had come to a well-deserved halt in the late 1940's but nobody had bothered to tell us. And so we celebrated Queen Victoria's birthday during whose reign the empire was at its apogee; and we kept up with the world as shown to us by Thomas Hardy and Charles Dickens and Jane Austen and John Keats and William Shakespeare, not for their sole literary value, not because the books by these authors might be the best books in all the world worth reading, but because it was the world of the people who held such intimate dominion over us, a world in which trouble and pain were the ideals of trouble and pain, such different trouble and pain from our own, which were messy and everlasting, never going away like the ones in the books would do when we closed the covers.

VThey did the same unorthodox training every day in Phoenix. They performed with the same cartoonish brashness. They ate a diet similar to the winner of the Kentucky Derby. And tonight they stood together on the top rung of the Olympic medal podium, each draped with an identical gold medal around his neck. Gary Hall Jr., who has struggled with diabetes, a suspension for marijuana use and a lifetime of expectation, and Anthony Ervin, the first swimmer of African-American descent on the United States Olympic swimming team, touched the electronic timing device at the same exact moment in the 50-meter freestyle race. When they turned to look at the scoreboard, both saw a rare and joyous sight. First place was registered next to both of their names in 21.98 seconds, and they pumped their fists in triumph.

VIn his upscale neighborhood of ranch-style houses in Las Vegas, Jonathan Burton was known as a model citizen. He helped young children learn to ride bicycles and play video games. He carried groceries for elderly people. ''I wish he was my son,'' said Mary Mahoney, who lives next door to the Burton family. But on a Southwest Airlines flight last month from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City, where Mr. Burton was planning to visit relatives, a different side of him emerged -- a wild and frantic side, according to passengers on the plane. His behavior cost him his life at the hands of fellow travelers who restrained him after he tried to kick down the door of the cockpit. He was 19.

The esquineros -- the men of the corner -- used to walk home alone from the corners where they gather each morning to be hired out for yardwork or other day jobs. Now they walk in groups. At one house, where the Guatemalans live, the door is punctured with bullet holes; a white man recently drove by and unloaded a pistol.

VThe court that will next hear the appeal of the government's antitrust case against Microsoft has dealt with some of the company's legal arguments in the past, handing the company its most significant victory before today. In 1998, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision ordering Microsoft to take its Internet Explorer Web browser out of its Windows 95 operating system. Two of the judges in that case remain among the seven judges who will now hear the appeal.

VHe did not have to choose between boxers or briefs. But in a lengthy MTV forum today, broadcast tonight, Vice President Al Gore did reveal that he had a compact disc by the alternative rock band Sister Hazel in his CD player right then, that he would probably write for a living if he were not otherwise employed next year, and that he coveted Air Force One more than any other White House perquisite. Between hip cultural references about Napster and the World Wrestling Federation (''Smackdown!'' Mr. Gore exclaimed when the topic was raised), the vice president explained his support for civil unions between homosexuals, his opposition to the legalization of medical marijuana and his distaste for misogynistic music. He was not asked about his underwear preference, as President Clinton was in a now infamous 1994 MTV forum (''Usually briefs,'' he responded).

VEnrique Miravala, known to all as Flaco, was a fixture at the corner of Wilson Avenue and Palmetto Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. A gentle, sometimes homeless alcoholic, 54 years old, he repaired cars expertly, swept storefronts and ran errands, earning beer money and the affection of his neighbors. But yesterday afternoon, the street where Mr. Miravala lived his life brought him his death. He was sitting on a blue swivel chair in front of a bodega eating onion rings from a paper container when a stray bullet from an argument hit him in the head, the police said.

VAmericans are very sophisticated about the relationship between politics and entertainment. Anybody can tell you that Richard Nixon blazed the trail in 1968 when he appeared on ''Laugh-In'' and muttered the show's catch phrase, ''Sock it to me.'' It was one of the first glimpses of the ''fun'' Nixon the nation would later come to love. We know this story because it was an important moment in our collective cultural history and also because it was the answer to the first million-dollar question on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''

VConspire to arrive by ship. Like Naples, like New York and Cape Town, Vancouver looks its best from the water, its shiny glass towers rising like Xanadu against a backdrop of indigo peaks whose foothills dip their toes in the harbor. Jan Morris, who has seen a city or two in her day, wrote that Vancouver's setting, at the southwest corner of Canada, ''is better than San Francisco's, because of the greenness, better than Sydney's, because of the mountains all around, rivaled perhaps only by Rio and Hong Kong.'' More than 40,000 newcomers take up residence each year, and the Vancouver metropolitan area now boasts a population of more than two million, third largest in Canada.

VThe first time that Amir Humuntal Lumban Tobing, an Indonesian mariner, was washed up into the American legal system, it was in a wave of international notoriety. He was the captain of the Golden Venture, above, a decrepit freighter that was grounded off the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens in 1993 after plans to land the boat's cargo of nearly 300 illegal Chinese immigrants went awry. Ten immigrants drowned or died of hypothermia after swimming toward shore, and nearly all the rest were taken into custody by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The incident was among the first to focus attention on the large-scale smuggling of Chinese to the United States.

VNo one can say for sure when the first seeds were planted, or how things reached the point where marijuana became Mendocino County's No. 1 cash crop and claim to fame. What is a given is that pot (the word of choice) is part of life here. It is so pervasive that when asked just how pervasive, residents chuckle and say you must be from somewhere else. Nearly everyone has an anecdote about stumbling onto the plant in a field or knowing a friend who grows it in the backyard. A local law firm makes a practice of marijuana legal defense and a public radio station warns residents when government helicopters are spanning the countryside looking for marijuana gardens.

VAt first glance, the Supreme Court term that opens on Monday figures to be a pale imitation of the blockbuster term that concluded in June. After all, there is no abortion case on the docket this time, no Miranda, no school prayer, no gay rights. There are federalism cases, but the debate over limits on Congressional authority by now has a familiar ring. And just days ago, the justices decided to sidestep the one case that would surely have put the term on the map, Microsoft's appeal in the government's antitrust case.

VASIA INDONESIA: SUHARTO SON A NO-SHOW -- Former President Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, failed to obey a summons to appear in court where prosecutors planned to arrest him to begin serving an 18-month prison sentence for corruption handed down on Sept. 22. Lawyers for Mr. Hutomo, left, who is known as Tommy, said he did not show up because he had not received a copy of the conviction order. With a court ruling last week that Mr. Suharto was too sick to stand trial on corruption charges, the country is watching to see if the Government will jail Mr. Hutomo. Calvin Sims (NYT)

VBuoyed by a recent lift in Conservative poll numbers, William Hague, the leader of the party, said today that it now had broader appeal to Britain's middle class than Labor and was fully prepared to run the country. In an address concluding the Tories' annual convention and looking ahead to an election expected in May, he asserted that the vaunted New Labor philosophy of Prime Minister Tony Blair had proved instead to be a fad, and the British people were now rejecting it.

VOn the morning of July 23, 1999, Billy Wafer, a forklift driver, was swept up in the biggest drug sting in local history: In this town of only 4,500 people, 43 suspects were arrested on charges of selling small amounts of cocaine. In some cases, hometown juries later meted out sentences ranging from 20 years to more than 300 years. In Tulia, an isolated place ringed by cotton farms and cattle ranches on the high plains of the Texas panhandle, local officials declared the operation a stunning success. In all, 22 of the defendants were sent to prison while others received probation. The undercover agent at the center of the operation, Tom Coleman, was even named by the state as lawman of the year.

VThe Heat Is on a Texas Town After the Arrests of 40 Blacks

ssVabstract

VYear after police conducted biggest drug sting in history of Tulia, Tex, civil rights groups and local minorities ask whether it was really a war on blacks; all but three of 43 defendants were black, an enormous percentage considering blacks make up less than 10 percent of town's population; in fact, 12 percent of town's black population was arrested; in all, 22 of defendants were sent to prison while others received probation; doubts raised about racial makeup of group arrested are compounded by contentions that investigation was flimsy; in nearly every case, sole evidence was word of undercover agent Tom Coleman, whose own character has come under criticism in past; three were no videotapes or wiretaps or corroborating witnesses; American Civil Liberties Union has filed lawsuit on behalf of defendant whose case was dismissed, accusing local officials of singling out blacks to run them out of town; reaction among most whites in Tulia has been unflinching support of operation and local officials; photos (L)

VFirst there was heroin, hooking so many of the black urban poor and breeding a contagion of crime. There was marijuana, enveloping vast numbers of the white middle class. Cocaine soon flourished, a symbol of a glittery, glassy-eyed, hedonistic time. Then came crack cocaine, a drug scourge more socially corrosive than any seen before. But this is hardly news. If pressed, most informed Americans could probably recount the various waves of illegal narcotics that have flooded the United States in the recent past, none of them ever fully receding.

VFresh from claiming to have unified his quarrelsome party, the Conservative leader, William Hague, was obliged today to abandon a vaunted new hard-line policy on first-time drug offenders after seven leadership associates said they had smoked marijuana in their youth. The proposal, put forward at the upbeat Conservative Party conference last week, called for $150 minimum fines and criminal records for people caught with small amounts of soft drugs in their possession or even in their bloodstream. It was the centerpiece of a ''zero tolerance'' law-and-order approach that the party is adopting as strategy in the election expected in the spring.

V''Vote Yes Prop 5,'' proclaims the large yellow mural painted on the side of a building here, complete with a large cannabis leaf. A poster on the window offers a quote from Ronald Reagan, though he has certainly not endorsed this particular measure: ''Government exists to protect us from each other. Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves.'' And just inside the door here at the headquarters of Free Hemp in Alaska are more than a dozen versions of pamphlets offering reasons for Alaskans to support the broadest marijuana legalization initiative ever to appear on a state ballot.

President Clinton was expected to decide soon whether to call an emergency summit meeting. A1 President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt held a two-hour meeting in Cairo with Mr. Arafat. A17

VIn Boston, the state police pull over a batboy who had borrowed the car of a Red Sox infielder and discover a vial containing anabolic steroids in the glove compartment. In San Diego, the Padres randomly test minor leaguers for steroids at spring training and find that about one in five test positive. In Miami, a veteran outfielder says he believes as many as 40 percent of major leaguers have used the muscle-building drugs. No one knows for certain how many professional ballplayers are using testosterone-based drugs, but there is a growing suspicion among many people in baseball that the national pastime has become tainted with steroid abuse.

VSpecial Report, Open Secret, discusses widespread suspicions about steroid use among major league baseball players; photos; major leagues do not randomly test players for performance-enhancing drugs, but suspicions have increased as more and more players put on muscle during off-season training and hitters begin slugging home runs at record pace; current and former players note that temptation is great with millions of dollars in future salary riding on offensive numbers; tantalizing hint comes from San Diego Padres, which for three years has randomly tested minor league players during spring training, and found one of every five testing positive; Colorado Rockies strength coach Brad Andress estimates about 30 percent of professional players have used steroids at some point; players themselves believe use is rampant; discovery of vial of steroids in car of Manny Alexander of Boston Red Sox noted, although that case has not yet been heard by magistrate; photos; union leaders call for scientific study on whether steroids do enhance performance in baseball (M)

As it happens, there is a Fort Knox-size supply of the precious, malleable, untarnishable stuff in New York at the moment. The exhibition ''The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes'' is glowing away at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And ''Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine'' opens today at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.

VTHE medicinal use of marijuana has scored some smashing victories at the polls in recent years, winning approval by voters in seven states, and it's on the ballot in two this fall. But in Alaska, an important test is at hand for those who use images like ''Trojan horse'' and ''camel's nose under the tent'' to argue that medical marijuana's advocates are really out to clear the way for the legal recreational use of the drug. Just two years after Alaska's voters backed a measure allowing doctors to prescribe marijuana for medical purposes, they are being asked whether the state should become the nation's first to legalize it, period. The measure is sweeping, allowing use by anyone 18 or older, giving amnesty for anyone ever convicted of growing or possessing marijuana, and even moving toward restitution for them.

VTHE SETTING -- Ralph Nader may not be included in the presidential debates, but on Tuesday night, inside the cozy auditorium of Public School 321, Park Slope's purple-turtleneck and grizzled-beard set made a place for him. Below walls hung with hand-painted quilts, 200 residents filed in for a local version of the Nader-Gore debate that never was. ''My husband and I were arguing,'' said Ellen Raider, 60, who works in conflict resolution at Columbia University and who spent last week posting 6,000 fliers around the neighborhood. ''I'm a Green and he's a Democrat, and so we decided to get the community together to debate this.''

VJo L. has never worked for money a single day of her life. She is 68 and lives alone in a lovely apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side. ''I never think about money, ever,'' she swears. ''I have no idea what things cost.'' Almost everything in Jo's apartment once belonged to her mother, a legendary New York art collector. But Jo has no use for these valuables -- Picassos, Chagalls, Henry Moores -- and has divided them among her children. What she is interested in is the work of liberal organizations. She invests much of her personal wealth in such groups as EMILY's List, National Coalition Against Censorship and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Her personal expenses are limited to food, books and replacing the occasional worn-out item in her home. ''You need shoes,'' she says. ''I bought a pair of sandals for summer. And I've decided to buy a doormat.'' She guesses the shoes cost somewhere around $50, but adds: ''I don't really know what these things cost. I just give them my credit card and they ring it up.'' The one expenditure she is aware of is the $85 per session, three times a week, that she spends on her personal exercise physiologist.

VThe First Half-Million Is the Hardest In the summer of 1999, David Johnson -- an Indianapolis attorney active in Indiana's Democratic Party -- decided to challenge Senator Richard Lugar, a four-term senator and onetime Republican presidential nominee. He immediately retained the services of Fred Yang, a pollster, and Frank Greer, a media consultant, who offered this advice: raise money. It makes you look like a serious candidate, he explained, thereby allowing you to raise still more money. Johnson, a political insider, knew whom to call. He took a leave of absence from his law firm and hit the phones; by the end of the year, he had amassed close to $500,000. Hire a Penny Pincher In February, Johnson hired a campaign manager: Tim Shock, a Democratic political consultant with a reputation for upsets. Because he'd have to commute from Kentucky, his salary was relatively high -- about $10,000 a month. But he kept a close eye on incidental spending. ''Nobody can authorize an expense, any expense, except me,'' Shock said. He guided Johnson to hire a press secretary and two field managers, who joined a finance manager and three fund-raisers already on staff. Total monthly salaries: about $20,000. He ordered ''Johnson for Senate'' signs and bumper stickers that were low gloss, chose adhesive lapel stickers (25,000 for $400) rather than pins (as much as 70 cents apiece) and had Johnson driven around, rather than flown, even on 10-hour round trips. Meanwhile Johnson kept raising money, and by late June he was up to $1.3 million, far more than Lugar's previous opponent raised but less than half of what Lugar had.

VTHE night before starting her new job, Maria nervously spread potential outfits for the big day across her narrow single bed. Choosing between pants and dresses and between a sassy lavender and a sedate beige, she sought a look that reflected the hope she invested in every detail of starting over. Maria is a recovering crack addict. She lives with her infant daughter in a ''therapeutic community'' town house on the Upper West Side for addicted mothers and their babies. Just minutes away are the park benches where she once slept, the addicts and dealers she once knew, and the corners where she once bought crack, sometimes with her body. Every day, as she takes three subway lines to work, cares for her daughter and negotiates therapy groups and training programs, the crack world hovers.

VThe surrounding jungle is slowly engulfing the tiny capital of this former Portuguese colony. More than a year after a devastating war, little has been rebuilt. The new president, elected in January, doesn't even have his own office, and his presidential palace, like many government buildings, is a burned-out shell. The broken streets are mostly empty by day. But nights are a different matter. At least eight big discotheques with high-tech lighting and sound systems lie hidden in the rubble. Bissau rarely has electricity because its power grid is severely damaged, but the clubs all have private generators. So thousands of impoverished city dwellers emerge from the darkness to dance the night away.

VTo the Editor: It is absolutely essential that voters in Alaska and elsewhere make a clear distinction between legalizing marijuana and allowing doctors to prescribe marijuana for medical purposes. Dr. Herbert D. Kleber stated this succinctly in ''What Is the Matter With Mary Jane?'' (Week in Review, Oct. 15), when he said that the former is political, the latter scientific, and that each should be judged accordingly.

VNEW YORK MANHATTAN: JUDGE TO REHEAR INTERNET CASE -- Oliver Jovanovic, who won a retrial on charges of kidnapping and assaulting a woman he met on the Internet, must go before the same judge who improperly excluded evidence in the first trial, an appeals court ruled yesterday. In December an appeals court overturned the conviction, criticizing the trial judge, William A. Wetzel, for preventing the jury from seeing e-mail messages in which the woman expressed interest in sadomasochism. She later accused Mr. Jovanovic of having tortured her for 20 hours. The decision yesterday did not explain why Mr. Jovanovic could not have another trial judge. Laura Mansnerus (NYT) SCHENECTADY: NEW LOTTERY MACHINES -- New York lottery fans, brace yourselves. As of tomorrow, new machines will be used for mixing and picking some of the winning numbers. The new machines will work the same way as the old ones. The difference is seven machines will be replaced by two: One with three chambers for Numbers, the three-number lottery, and one with four chambers for Win 4. A third machine, which has been used to pick Take 5, Lotto and Pick 10, will not change. (AP) MANHATTAN: SUIT AGAINST YANKEES DISMISSED -- A federal judge yesterday dismissed a racial discrimination lawsuit against the New York Yankees. V. Whitney Joseph had alleged in her lawsuit that the Stadium Club, a restaurant in Yankee Stadium, had discriminated against her because she is black. On July 20, 1998, she said, she was barred from the club because she was wearing a tank top, a violation of the club's posted dress code. When she changed into a T-shirt, she was admitted, but said she then saw white women there wearing tank tops. Judge Sidney H. Stein ruled that Ms. Joseph had failed to allege ''a likelihood of future harm,'' a necessary condition for the suit to go forward. (NYT) MINEOLA: MONEY FOR SUPERFUND URGED -- Environmental groups called on elected officials yesterday to refinance the New York State Superfund, a toxic-site cleanup program that has run out of money. The state program, which was created in 1982 to clean up toxic dumps and spills not covered by the federal Superfund program, is run by the Department of Environmental Conservation. Jennifer Post, a spokeswoman for the department, confirmed yesterday that 790 toxic sites in the state lack the money to be cleaned up. Todd Stebbins, Long Island regional director for New York Public Interest Research Group, said 124 of these sites are on Long Island, where drinking water is threatened. Tara Bahrampour (NYT) MANHATTAN: TRASH CUSTOMERS DROPPED -- Waste Management has won permission from the city to follow through on its plan to eliminate unprofitable routes by dropping about 3,000 customers, about 10 percent of its customer base. The Trade Waste Commission had ordered the company to halt its move after some of its approximately 3,300 affected customers complained that Waste Management was disregarding written contracts. The company has agreed to honor about 315 contracts, with the service for the remaining 3,000 to be cut off Nov. 1, city officials said yesterday. Eric Lipton (NYT) QUEENS: LIBRARIANS SEEK RAISES -- Librarians demanding a pay increase demonstrated yesterday outside a trustees meeting of the Queens Central Library. The librarians, members of the Queensboro Library Guild, part of District Council 37, said the library should use the $2.6 million that the City Council restored to the library's budget to increase salaries. The union said about one-fourth of Queens librarians quit last year to take higher-paying jobs. Steven Greenhouse (NYT) CONNECTICUT FAIRFIELD: MOLD CLOSES SCHOOL -- McKinley Elementary School has been closed indefinitely while health officials investigate air quality problems believed responsible for making students sick. The decision to shut the school was made Wednesday night. McKinley will not be reopened until doctors from the University of Connecticut Medical Center and a Maine company that specializes in building science, figure out how to rid the school of high mold spore levels. Dr. Eileen Storey of the university said McKinley has ''mold that is beyond what we want to see.'' She said it was still unclear how dangerous the mold was but added the school had to be closed and cleaned. (AP) NEW JERSEY TRENTON: PRE-TEENAGE DRUG USE -- Fewer middle school students around the state are smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol, a survey found. The survey also found that students who talk regularly to their parents are less likely to drink or use drugs. The survey, conducted among seventh and eighth graders without teachers present, found that 9 percent of students reported having smoked marijuana within the past year, down from 11 percent in 1998, and 13 percent from 1995, the first year the Partnership for a Drug Free New Jersey did the survey. Alcohol use was down to 41 percent from 49 in 1995. Steve Strunsky (NYT) SPRINGFIELD: AUTO DEALERS SETTLE CHARGES -- A group of five auto dealerships has agreed to pay more than $200,000 in prosecution costs and restitution to customers to settle complaints of unfair practices, the state attorney general's office announced yesterday. The 73 complaints against Toresco Auto Group, which includes the sprawling Autoland dealership on Route 22 in Springfield, involved allegations that dealers failed to refund deposits and used bait-and-switch tactics, said Jennifer Doktorski, a spokeswoman for the attorney general. Toresco did not admit any wrongdoing. Toresco's lawyer, Theodore Schiller, said the number of complaints, dating from 1993 to 1999, was negligible compared with the 149,000 sales and thousands of repairs by the dealers during that time. Steve Strunsky (NYT) CALENDAR Monday HEARING ON SIGHTSEEING BUSES -- The City Council plans to take testimony from city officials and private companies on a proposed change in city law requiring sightseeing companies to ensure that their buses comply with emissions standards. Council Chambers, City Hall, Manhattan, 10 am. Information: (212) 788-7210.

But during the school day, residents say, teenagers from a neighboring high school trample the grass and throw empty beer bottles on the ground. Recently, residents have discovered more covert activities. They say students have been going into the garages and laundry rooms to take drugs and have sex.

VSteve is a 17-year-old with a scraggly goatee, a propensity to wear Grateful Dead T-shirts and a strange medical complaint. A few months earlier, in response to symptoms of clinical depression, I had placed him on Prozac, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, known as S.S.R.I. Although he no longer complained of sadness, poor concentration and boredom, the problems that gave occasion to his being prescribed Prozac, he was now experiencing frequent disturbances of color and occasional moments when people he was looking at transformed into cartoonlike figures.

VIt is a pretty safe bet that Mark J. Dunau is the only New York candidate in the Senate race who has an organic salad at a Manhattan restaurant named in his honor. He is without a doubt the only candidate who lives in a barn where the bathroom has curtains for walls and the guest quarters are known as the Love Shack. And he alone sees political capital in boasting that Click and Clack of public radio's ''Car Talk'' once broadcast a question about his old Suburban. Mr. Dunau is the Green Party candidate for Senate, one of six people other than Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio who want to represent New York in the Senate. If Mrs. Clinton shared some of Mr. Dunau's peculiarities -- or, for that matter, embraced his 23-page manifesto, which calls for the legalization of marijuana, a cap on credit card interest rates and a ban on spreading sewage sludge on farmlands -- it would be a sensation from Buffalo to Bombay.

VThe pregame atmosphere outside Shea Stadium was more like a morgue than a madhouse. The home team was down two games to none and the fans still had visions of Roger Clemens dancing in their heads. That was, of course, before the Mets beat the Yankees, 4-2, in Game 3 to make this a series again. Earlier in the day, when the Yankee team bus arrived somewhere around 4 p.m. and as the players entered through the press gate, there were a few choice words for Roger Clemens, but he did not accept the bait and the fans offered little more in return.

VBY most measures, Great Neck's high school students are in great shape academically, socially and economically. But for those in this wealthy enclave who might have thought their schools were immune from the problems facing schools nationwide, a student survey made public this fall has burst the balloon. The 130-question survey developed by the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (Pride, for short) seeks to measure students' involvement with drugs and alcohol, as well as the environment, in school and outside it, in which any substance abuse occurs. The Pride survey has been administered to more than seven million students throughout the country since 1982, and to 18,000 students in New York State this year, where results are used to direct state funding of local antidrug and safe-schools programs.

That leaves the Eastern Conference essentially wide open as the National Basketball Association season begins tomorrow night. The West is, indeed, best. Portland has retooled to compete with the Lakers, and Tim Duncan is healthy enough to help David Robinson. In the end, the Lakers still have too much heat. The 29 teams in predicted order of finish.

VASIA KYRGYZSTAN: PRESIDENT RE-ELECTED -- Askar Akayev was re-elected to a third term with nearly 75 percent of the vote in a six-man race, according to unofficial results released by the Central Election Commission. His nearest competitor was Omurbek Tekebayev, deputy speaker of the Parliament, who had 14 percent. The election was marred by intimidation and instances of ballot-box stuffing, said the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other groups that monitored voting, but President Akayev called it fair and democratic.

VThe State of Illinois asked the Supreme Court today to let police officers bar people from entering their homes during the time it takes to get a warrant to search for drugs or other illegal items that can readily be destroyed. An Illinois appeals court found that the practice of impounding a home -- limiting the occupants freedom of movement and securing the building from the outside -- violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures.

VLawsuits filed by thousands of former Indian boarding school students in Canada, claiming sexual, physical and ''cultural'' abuse, threaten to swamp the financial resources of four mainstream Christian churches that ran the schools until 1970. ''I simply see us going broke,'' Duncan D. Wallace, the Anglican bishop of Qu'Appelle, which encompasses Regina, said of his diocese. With resignation, he added, ''When you get down to it, all we need is a bottle of wine, a book and a table, and we are in business.''

VLawsuits filed by thousands of former Indian boarding school students in Canada, claiming sexual, physical and 'cultural' abuse, threaten to bankrupt four mainstream Christian churches that ran schools until 1970; Canadian government forecasts that 16,000 Indians, or 7 percent of living alumni of boarding schools, will have entered some form of claim against Anglican Church, Roman Catholic Church, Presbyterian Church or United Church; behind suits is real pain of many Canadian Indians who were rounded up and forced into schools starting in late 19th century, when Canada's government turned to established churches to carry out federal obligations to educate Indians; churches ran network of aboriginal boarding schools; in forced assimilation, children as young as 5 were taken from their families to faraway boarding schools and forbidden to speak their native languages; with parents forbidden to visit, boarding schools sometimes became places where pedophiles freely preyed on defenseless, disoriented children; photos (M)

Beneath the halo of the ceiling-mounted video projector in his basement screening room, Ron Howard sprawled across an upholstered seat in the front row and absent-mindedly stroked his chin as the rippling glare of the movie played over his upturned face. ''When I first saw 'The Graduate,' this whole montage sequence, it was magic to me,'' Mr. Howard said. ''I couldn't figure out how they did it.''

VIN Italo Calvino's 1972 novel, ''Invisible Cities,'' a fictional Marco Polo recounts his journeys through imagined lands and their dreamlike capitals. In these mysterious places, people mingle in a caldron of exuberance and suffering, against a backdrop of clashing architecture and sensuous detail. Then Polo comes to a region called Trude, where every town has ''the same little greenish and yellowish houses'' and ''the same flower beds in the same square.'' He wanders stupefied across this zone, where ''only the name of the airport changes.'' Never mind living here, Polo thinks. Why even visit?

VIt has been two weeks since the murder trial of Rae Carruth, the former Panthers wide receiver, began in Charlotte, N.C., and the prosecution and the defense have not finished choosing a jury. Even though the two sides have yet to make their opening arguments, the outlines of their cases have begun to emerge. The selection of jurors has become bogged down amid charges by defense lawyers that the prosecutors are trying to keep black male jurors off the panel. But many details about the events leading up to the shooting of Carruth's pregnant girlfriend in November 1999 have come to light in court motions and in transcripts of police interviews with witnesses that have been obtained by local journalists.

VHere in Massachusetts, voters gave themselves a giant tax cut. In Maine, they split down the middle over assisted suicide and gay rights. And in several states, they leaned toward changes in drug policy, from legalizing the medical use of marijuana to giving some drug offenders treatment instead of jail time. Across the country, voters faced a bumper crop of initiatives -- 204 in all, in 42 states -- as they plowed through some longer-than-usual ballots, deciding directly on issues so tricky and tough that many a legislator surely felt relieved to see them punted to the people.

VIt was the Senate campaign of the century, but it sounded at first like a joke. Back in October 1998, in the middle of impeachment -- and before the last New York Senate race even ended -- Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem teasingly told Hillary Rodham Clinton in Chicago that she should be the next candidate from New York. ''She said, 'Who would want me to run there?' '' Mr. Rangel recalled this week. ''But she had a twinkle in her eye. And I knew then this was more than a joke with her.'' From that point on, the campaign of a first lady against two dizzyingly different men -- the famous, irascible mayor of the nation's most chaotic city and a little-known congressman from a tidy corner of Long Island -- defied all the normal narrative rules of a political campaign. ''You will never see a race like this again,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer said.

VVoters confronted more than 200 state ballot initiatives on Tuesday. On at least three controversial issues -- drug laws, school vouchers and gun control -- they sent interesting and important messages to the rest of the country. In California, voters approved by a large margin a drug law reform measure requiring mandatory drug treatment, instead of jail time, for offenders convicted of simple drug possession. The measure will also provide $120 million a year for treatment programs. This vote underscores what appears to be rising public dissatisfaction with drug sentencing policies, like New York's harsh Rockefeller-era drug laws, that emphasize incarceration rather than treatment, filling jails at great expense without curbing either drug abuse or drug-related crime.

VEditorial comments on results of voting on some ballot initiatives relating to drug laws, school vouchers and gun control; lauds California's passage of measure requiring mandatory treatment rather than jail time for offenders convicted of simple drug possession; says vote underscores what appears to be rising public dissatisfaction with drug sentencing policies that fill jails at great expense without curbing either drug abuse or drug-related crime; says rejection of school voucher initiatives in California and Michigan should serve as warning to voucher supporters that voters simply are not convinced that siphoning off of public funds for vouchers can improve education for all; says success of tighter gun control measures in Oregon and Colorado should demonstrate to Congress that even voters in states with large numbers of hunters and sportsmen want sensible gun control (M)

VCalifornia's enormous prison system, the largest in the Western Hemisphere with more than 162,000 inmates, may be radically altered since voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a measure that will sentence nonviolent drug offenders to treatment instead of prison. Nearly one in three prisoners in California is serving time for a drug-related crime, more per capita than any other state. The new law, Proposition 36, puts California at the forefront of a national movement to change drug laws; it will send first- and second-time nonviolent drug offenders into treatment, reducing the prison population by as many as 36,000 inmates a year, according to the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.

VAn 8-year-old boy accidentally shot his 7-year-old brother in the head on Tuesday, the police here said, and the boy died this morning. The police have arrested the owner of the gun, the boys' stepbrother and legal guardian, who they said was a drug dealer. The 7-year-old, Shakur Forte, was pronounced dead at 11:16 a.m. today at University Hospital, apparently from the single gunshot wound to the back of his head, said Rogers Ramsey, a hospital spokesman. The other boy, who has not been charged and whose name was withheld, was uninjured and was put in the custody of an aunt, whose name was also withheld, said Lt. Derek Glenn, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department.

VA 31-year-old New Jersey man died Monday after a confrontation with police officers who used pepper spray to subdue him when, the police said, he resisted arrest and kicked out the window of a patrol car. The man, Mitchel Spero of Marlboro, was pronounced dead at 12:48 a.m. at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, where he was taken after his arrest less than two hours earlier in Monroe Township, said Lawrence West, the first assistant Middlesex County prosecutor. Mr. West said the cause of death might not be known for six weeks, when toxicology tests are due to be completed. ''At this point, there's no evidence to suggest the police officers acted improperly,'' he said. ''But obviously the investigation will not be closed until the autopsy report is completed.''

VA 21-year-old man has been convicted of criminally negligent homicide in what lawyers describe as the first criminal trial of a skier who accidentally caused the death of another on the slopes. A jury of seven men and five women, all of whom said when selected for the panel that they were either skiers or snowboarders, returned the verdict late Thursday night in Eagle County District Court. The defendant was Nathan Hall, who had been charged with reckless manslaughter. The lesser charge of which he was found guilty could bring him as much as six years in prison when he is sentenced in January.

VOf all the odd and misguided tenets by which Eddie Vaughn lived his life, perhaps the most troubling was his view of the law. ''There's the law way, and there's my way,'' is a maxim Vaughn frequently repeated. He expressed this doctrine by beating his wife and dealing in narcotics and pulling a gun or a knife on whoever he felt required it. Anyone who believed in the righteousness or sanctity of the legal system was, by definition, Vaughn's enemy. He had a temper both violent and unpredictable, and even those who admired him realized that if Vaughn were to encounter the wrong person, in the wrong situation, he was liable to impose a punishment of his own furious creation. Fred Capps was a lawyer. He was a state prosecutor, a zealous -- some have said excessively zealous -- defender of the law, a man with morals so rigidly defined that he was usually loath to pursue anything less than the maximum possible punishment. ''With Fred it was either right or it was wrong,'' says one of his closest friends. ''There was no soft middle.'' During trials, Capps was so intense that he could neither sleep nor eat nor discuss anything other than the case at hand. His reverence for the law was as strong as Vaughn's disdain, and his abilities in a courtroom were at once remarkable and daunting. To Fred Capps, the notion of removing from society people like Eddie Vaughn was his life's motivating force. To Eddie Vaughn, the idea of being punished by a man like Fred Capps was his vision of hell -- in fact, as it turned out, he deemed it a fate worse than death. It is clear that people like Eddie Vaughn and Fred Capps should never come near each other, and in a big city or even a large town they probably would not. But Vaughn and Capps were reared in the same tiny place, a community called Burkesville, nestled deep within the Cumberland Mountains of far southern Kentucky.

VWITH the advent of the Christmas tourist season, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has begun another quality-of-life campaign. Fine. The innate qualities of this city, after all, do not lean toward the most gracious. Unfortunately, City Hall's designated targets are pretty much limited to a familiar list of urban miscreants: squeegee men, the homeless, prostitutes, pot smokers and radio blarers. This is not enough. How often, really, does the average New Yorker smell marijuana on the streets (and those who recognize the scent probably do not mind) or get approached by a seedy guy wielding Windex?

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Carruth, a 26-year-old who was once a first-round draft pick of the Carolina Panthers. He is accused of hiring three men to kill his pregnant girlfriend, Cherica L. Adams, and then leading her into an ambush.

Even though Prime Minister Jean Chretien and his Liberal Party are likely to extend their seven-year rule in the national election on Nov. 27, it was Mr. Day and his new Canadian Alliance that prompted the vote and forced Mr. Chretien to tack uncharacteristically hard to the right.

The victim, a 16-year-old student at Franklin K. Lane High School, was accosted as he stood on the J line platform at 75th Street and Jamaica Avenue shortly after noon, said Sgt. William Stiles, a police spokesman. He was stabbed 14 times in the back, chest and left arm and shoved onto the tracks, the police said, but he was able to climb back to the platform and ask the token agent for help. He was in stable condition yesterday after surgery at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. C. J. Chivers (NYT)

VFour days after four children were molested in a Queens elementary school, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday released data showing that while crime in the city's public schools had decreased over all, reports of sexual offenses had nearly tripled. But the mayor and the city schools chancellor said the sexual incidents, which increased by 198 percent in the year after the police School Security Division took responsibility for school buildings and playgrounds, did not necessarily reflect a higher incidence of crime.
