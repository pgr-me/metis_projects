VSmall Time Crooks Woody Allen's film sheds his fabled angst and reaches back for his wide-eyed innocence of yesteryear. Harry (Mr. Allen), an ad dlebrained ex-convict, seeks to satisfy Frenchy (Tracey Ullman, left), his cash-starved, upwardly striving wife, with his plan to rob a bank. Actually, Frenchy's new cookie shop becomes the family's big moneymaker. New wealth attracts a sleazy art dealer (Hugh Grant), who woos Frenchy into financial ruin. But then a new robbery scheme emerges, making for a bit of a U-turn in plot but doing minimum harm to a film whose fleeting delights, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ''have to do with its tone, its light and lovely throwaway humor, and its deftly easygoing performances.'' 2000. DreamWorks. $107.37; DVD, $26.99. 95 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Saving Grace Trying to do for the marijuana business what ''The Full Monty'' did for male striptease, Nigel Cole's film stars Craig Ferguson as a transplanted Scottish gardener who helps a widow named Grace (Brenda Blethyn) grow a crop of weed that will fetch the $450,000 she needs to keep her pretty stone house in Cornwall. Naturally, a lot of dotty and stuffy Englishmen and women get stoned, and two biddies inevitably brew a pot of tea from the wrong leaves in a gentle, silly movie that would ''peter out in triviality if not for Ms. Blethyn's gift for finding the pain and frustration behind Grace's facade of housewifely capability'' (A. O. Scott). 2000. New Line. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 93 minutes. Closed captioned. R. The Virgin Suicides After the youngest of five lush teenage sisters kills herself, the other four follow suit with a chilling, unstoppable finality. What's more, they go smilingly and for reasons no one can quite figure, least of all the doting boys who chart their every move and are affected by the suicides for the rest of their lives. More than most movies about suburban adolescence, Sofia Coppola's first film ''catches both the triviality and the grandeur of youth, its prosaic details and its mythopoetic flights'' (Scott). 2000. Paramount. $96.15; DVD, $29.99. 97 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Road Trip To intercept his girlfriend's mail bearing a video of himself in flagrante delicto with someone else, Josh (Breckin Meyer) and friends pile into a car and head cross country. Along the way the car gets wrecked, the boys learn a new procedure in a sperm bank, and there's a disgusting experience with French toast. After a riot in a mailroom, they drive home. On the trip Josh gets tutored in philosophy; later he sells copies of the tape on eBay. ''As we all know, bad taste is timeless. And sometimes it is so funny that you can't help laughing'' (Stephen Holden). 2000. DreamWorks. $107.37; DVD, $26.99. 91 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Keep in Mind On cassette and DVD since April, ''Boys Don't Cry,'' starring Hilary Swank, has the longest legs on Video Business magazine's best renter list of smaller titles with limited theatrical release. Here are some other films on the list. AMERICAN PIMP. The Hughes Brothers (Allen and Albert) fan out from coast to coast for a sweeping survey of a dozen alternately odious and hilarious managers of the world's oldest profession. 1999. MGM. $100.96; DVD, $19.98. 86 minutes. Closed captioned. R. THE BIG KAHUNA. Scheming to unload a lot of product, three salesmen (Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito and Peter Facinelli) hole up in a Kansas City hotel room. 2000. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $26.98. 91 minutes. Closed captioned. R. UP AT THE VILLA. In Philip Haas's adaptation of a lesser novella by W. Somerset Maugham, an English widow (Kristin Scott Thomas) adrift in Tuscany becomes entangled with an imperial muckety-muck (James Fox) and an American adventurer (Sean Penn). 2000. USA. $56.49; DVD, $24.95. 115 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. TITUS. Julie Taymor's fluid time-traveling fantasia of violence and revenge gives Shakespeare's bloody tale the look of a sophisticated video game. 1999. Fox. $104.16; DVD, $34.98. 160 minutes. R. BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER. A high school cheerleader (Natasha Lyonne) with alternative sexual tendencies is shipped off to a heterosexual rehab camp. 2000. Universal. $99.36; DVD, $24.98. 84 minutes. Closed captioned. R. A MAP OF THE WORLD. A beleaguered school nurse and farm wife (Sigourney Weaver) battles her self-destructiveness in the face of tragedy. 1999. USA. $56.49; DVD, $24.95. 125 minutes. Closed captioned. R.

VA mine deep in the tundra of northern Canada has long yielded a steady supply of copper and zinc, but it will soon produce a very different bounty -- the country's first supply of legal marijuana. The Health Ministry has awarded a $3.8 million contract to a company that will grow the plant for medicinal purposes in its laboratory in the mine, hundreds of feet below a lake near Flin Flon, Manitoba.

VPresident-elect George W. Bush, ending a fast-paced week of organizing his cabinet, today selected John Ashcroft, one of the Republican Party's leading social conservatives, as the next attorney general. Mr. Bush described Senator Ashcroft, who was defeated in his bid for re-election last month in Missouri, as ''a man of deep conviction'' who would be dedicated to ''the impartial administration of justice.'' The conservative views on social issues held by Mr. Ashcroft, who is 58 and the son and grandson of Assembly of God ministers, have been the hallmark of his service as governor and senator. The announcement led some Democrats among Mr. Ashcroft's former Senate colleagues to promise a vigorous examination of his record on abortion, the death penalty and judicial appointments.

VThe thing to remember about Yves Saint Laurent, the greatest living couturier, is that he doesn't know when to quit. He is a man of extremes, a champion binger. Give him his favorite brand of cigarettes, Peter Stuyvesant, and he will run through them like a child running through corn. ''He smokes 150 a day,'' says Pierre Berge, who, as the business brains behind Saint Laurent and the person closest to him for the past 42 years, has seen him through far more easily fatal forms of self-abuse. Once in Marrakech, when he was still getting high (mostly on cocaine, Saint Laurent says), his friend and court muse Loulou de la Falaise showed him how instead of smoking hashish he could get the same effect from pinching a little bit off and swallowing it. ''He said, 'You can do that?''' recalls her husband, Thadee Klossowski, a son of the painter Balthus. ''And she said, 'Sure.' Well, that day he had eaten the whole thing.'' And the excesses weren't confined to drugs and drink. ''I've had an extraordinary sex life,'' Saint Laurent told me in September. Indeed, to look at the lithe, thin, shadowy figure of Saint Laurent in the late 1960's and early 70's, when he had himself photographed nude for a cologne ad, is to realize just how willful he was. ''Wild, dirty talking, really funny,'' is how Karl Lagerfeld describes him in those days. Today, Saint Laurent rarely leaves his apartment on the Rue de Babylone except to go to work. His public image is that of a lonely nervous wreck being bullied by the more aggressive Berge. Seeing Saint Laurent now, it's difficult to picture him collapsing his friends with laughter -- or taunting Berge, then his lover, so mercilessly that once, according to Klossowski, Berge picked up a knife and chased Saint Laurent down a flight of stairs. But he was always hard to pin down. Recalling the apartment on the Place Vauban that Saint Laurent shared with Berge in the 60's, Klossowski says: ''Yves had this tiny room, with a sliding door and one window, very narrow. Just a bed and this window, out of which he would escape. God knows where he would go.''

VNEW YORK ALBANY: NEATNESS COUNTS Along with cracking down on illegal gun ownership and improving the office technology, Albany County's district attorney-elect, Paul Clyne, vows to straighten up the fashion front in his office. ''Everyone laughs because I look like I come out of the 50's,'' Mr. Clyne said. ''But I wear a suit, dress shoes, a white shirt and a tie. I'm not going to be on the cover of GQ, but at least I look like a professional.'' Now an assistant district attorney, he takes over as top prosecutor on Jan. 1. The departing district attorney, Sol Greenberg, 79, was known for his dapper suits, but critics said his hands-off leadership contributed to an outmoded workplace, underpaid staffers and a disorganized office. (AP) NEW PALTZ: SUNY'S OLDEST STUDENT Years ago, Clara Pankow Miller gave piano lessons to the host of ''Howdy Doody.'' Now, at 92, Ms. Miller, of Wappingers Falls, is the State University of New York's oldest student, a freshman at SUNY New Paltz. When she saw an advertisement offering college credits for life experiences, she signed up. ''I built up a book for them and got 88 credits,'' Ms. Miller said. ''I did this for my self-satisfaction.'' (AP)

VThe problem is apparent at retirement parties in catering halls and the back rooms of bars, where New York City police officers toast the good fortune of their departing colleagues. Or at Police Headquarters, where officers openly proclaim their bitterness toward the job in elevators crowded with bosses. Or in decaying station houses, where supervisors program desktop computers to measure their time left to retirement, down to the minute. In each of these places, and across every rank, the darkened mood of the New York Police Department has become obvious. The isolated dissatisfactions that were once just muttered have now swelled into a growl of discontent.

VIn a case that helped draw attention to a subculture of animal-mutilation videos, a Long Island man has been sentenced to probation and community service for making so-called crush videos. But prosecutors and animal rights groups are criticizing the sentence as overly lenient. The man, Thomas Capriola, 30, of Islip Terrace, was sentenced last Friday by a Suffolk County Court judge to 280 hours of community service with three years' probation, after pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges of animal cruelty and marijuana possession.

VWhile many Americans followed the coverage of President Clinton's symbolic gesture granting clemency to two federal drug offenders last week, an important development in national drug policy received less attention: Mr. Clinton became the first sitting president to question the impact of our nation's war on drugs. In a recent issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Mr. Clinton said he supported decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana and an end to the disparity in sentencing for offenses involving crack and powder cocaine. He also questioned the use of mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and called for serious reconsideration of the federal imprisonment policies that result in hundreds of thousands of nonviolent drug offenders winding up behind bars for years.

VWHEN is a bargain not a bargain? I asked myself this as I stood at the back of a line of nearly 200 frustrated people at the KLM counter in Newark Airport. Back in October, I'd pulled off what then seemed an incredible coup: a round trip from New York to Berlin with a stop in Amsterdam each way, leaving Nov. 30 for just $401. Even though fares to Europe were at rock-bottom, this seemed amazing. I could hardly restrain myself from calling friends and acquaintances to boast. Oh, beware ye travelers the sin of pride! Shortly after arrival at Newark, it became clear that I had been cast into the fiery pit of Canceled Flight Hell. Mine was not the deepest circle, however. That was reserved for the Indians on the flight, for whom Amsterdam was but the first stop on a 20-hour journey to Mumbai or Delhi.

VChic in charcoal pinstripes and chunky shoes, her blond hair clipped back, Debra Walcott is a poised, fresh-faced 22-year-old. She is also a recovering heroin addict who bears some resemblance to the teenager in the new movie ''Traffic,'' a character whose drug habit quickly devours her comfortable middle-class life. For Ms. Walcott, watching the ''Traffic'' character Caroline Wakefield lose everything was like reliving the five years she spent using drugs or scheming to get more. ''That did happen to me,'' said Ms. Walcott, who grew up in Dix Hills, an affluent community on Long Island built atop new money. ''I remember getting kicked out of my house, losing my license, my car.''

VNEW YORK MANHATTAN: PROTEST OVER HOSPITAL LAYOFFS -- Dozens of unionized health care workers picketed outside Mount Sinai Hospital yesterday, continuing a weeklong protest against layoffs of about 70 long-term employees. The union, 1199/SEIU, New York's health and human service union, accused the hospital of laying off the workers without the required 30-day notice, and of laying off long-term employees before probationary workers. In a statement, Mount Sinai said it regretted the layoffs, saying they were imposed to hold down costs. Steven Greenhouse (NYT)

VJames Cohan Gallery 41 West 57th Street Through tomorrow Fred Tomaselli has gained attention as much for the substance as for the look of his art. His collage-based paintings are composed of patterns of multicolored, segmented lines set on a black ground. Sometimes the lines are painted; more often they are made up of various forms of psychoactive drugs -- pills, marijuana leaves -- applied to the work's surface.

VThree recent events hint at a change in public attitudes toward the war on drugs. On Wednesday, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed softening the harsh Rockefeller-era drug laws in New York State. Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey acknowledged that her state police had been stopping black and Hispanic drivers as part of a drug-enforcement effort the public once applauded and moved to stop the practice. And within the last two weeks President Clinton has not only urged a re-examination of federal drug sentencing, but also proposed equalizing penalties for possession of powdered and crack cocaine, on the ground that the stiffer penalties for crack discriminated against members of ethnic minorities. If politicians are societal weather vanes, then the war on drugs seems to be losing some appeal. For decades, experts on drug addiction have argued that long prison terms for nonviolent drug offenders, many of whom are addicts as well, are less effective than drug-treatment programs at reducing crime. They also say imprisonment is more expensive than treatment. The country's prison population has grown to two million, and a quarter of the inmates are serving time for drug offenses.

VThe Frugal Traveler column on Jan. 7, about Amsterdam, misstated the legal status of marijuana and hashish there. The press officer of the consulate general of the Netherlands says that the sale of five grams or less of marijuana or hashish to patrons 18 or older is allowed in Amsterdam in establishments known as coffee shops. But the drugs are not legal, contrary to an assertion made in the column. Their sale is a ''non indictable offense'' that is given a low enforcement priority, she says.

VHow Bad It Is to Be 20 Years Old The pill was white and smelled like No-Doz. Although it had come to us in the mail inside a tennis ball, it was legal then, fresh from a lab in Texas. No rumors, no culture surrounding it. We took it on a whim, on blind faith -- because it was Saturday and there was nothing better to do. It was late afternoon, warm for November in New Hampshire. Starting that day in 1984, and until May 1986, I ate Ecstasy, once or sometimes twice a month. During that same time I realized that the plan I'd made for my life (I was 20 years old) was useless. I kind of woke up. I didn't start wearing flowers in my hair, but I got more excited to live, made a new plan that felt freer -- a plan that sent me in the right direction. And I still wonder what the drug had to do with that. Maybe nothing. (How can a drug do anything for you? Generally I hate drugs. I don't even take Advil.) It's impossible to say. But because it was inside my noodle, I can't separate out the Ecstasy.

VIt was an early morning in November 1998 that began the startling transformation of Giants defensive tackle Keith Hamilton. He was driving across the George Washington Bridge at 1:30 a.m., coming back from a party, cruising at 71 miles an hour in a 45 m.p.h. zone when he saw the flashing lights of a police car in his rearview mirror. The police had stopped him for speeding, but said that they also found a small bag containing marijuana in his car, and a pipe.

VUnder a blue sky that seemed hand-picked for the moment today, Jennifer Capriati found comfort in a place that once made her recoil and discovered joy in a game that once shredded her innocence. Eleven years after she turned professional, almost seven years since she vanished from the sport, Capriati was thrilled to be standing inside Rod Laver Arena, hoisting the first Grand Slam trophy of her career after defeating the world's No. 1 player, Martina Hingis, 6-4, 6-3, in the final of the Australian Open.

VFive months after splitting 7 to 7 on whether to grant a new hearing to a man condemned to death for killing a police officer, an appeals court today stayed his execution to provide more time for the United States Supreme Court to consider his claim that he has new evidence. The execution of the man, Philip Ray Workman, had been scheduled for 1 a.m. Wednesday, and could still proceed then if the Supreme Court rules against him early next week. The stay was issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit a day after the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole voted unanimously to recommend that Gov. Don Sundquist not grant clemency. In doing so, the board dismissed the relevance of the recantation of a crucial witness and of a new defense theory about ballistics evidence.

She was just moments away from leaving the grounds for a photo session reserved for the Australian Open champion, and yet she was far removed from a time when she bristled at the flashbulbs that flooded the infancy of her career.

VNEW YORK BROOKLYN: FIRE HURTS 2 CHILDREN -- Two sisters were critically injured when a fire broke out in their second-floor apartment in Ocean Hill early yesterday morning, police and fire officials said. The girls, identified as Latisha Jackson, 6, and Latifah Jackson, 7, were resuscitated and treated for smoke inhalation at St. Mary's Hospital of Brooklyn, a hospital spokeswoman said. They were transferred to the New York Weill Cornell Center, where they were both listed in critical condition. The cause of the fire, which took about 30 minutes to control, was electrical in nature, a Fire Department spokesman said. Diane Cardwell (NYT) MANHATTAN: VALLONE TO VISIT ISRAEL -- The City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, left, is traveling to Israel tomorrow, where he will visit holy sites in Jerusalem and meet with Israeli government officials, he said yesterday. Mr. Vallone, a Democratic candidate for mayor, and City Councilman Noach Dear, who is also making the trip, say they hope to show American tourists that it is safe to travel to Israel despite a United States State Department warning. Mr. Vallone said the trip would last through Saturday and would be paid for with private donations and personal money. Eric Lipton (NYT)

VThe Ravens Slam the Door Having persuaded themselves that the Baltimore Ravens' defense could not possibly be as good as their record suggested, and that in any case coach Jim Fassell and his quarterback, Kerry Collins, would find a way around it, New Yorkers were understandably shocked by the Giants' 34-7 loss in Super Bowl XXXV Sunday night. Collins took most of the heat in yesterday's post-mortems, some of it deserved. After strong performances earlier in the playoffs, particularly in the Giants' 41-0 thrashing of the Minnesota Vikings in the conference championship game two weeks ago, Collins faltered at the worst possible moment, throwing four interceptions. That tied a Super Bowl record, but there were other records suggesting that what really made the difference was not Collins's mistakes but the Ravens' swarming defense. The Giants had as many punts (11, a Super Bowl record) as first downs. Between them the two teams set a Super Bowl record for fewest total yards, 393, of which the Giants accounted for a pitiful 149.

VGEORGE W. BUSH won not only the presidency and the chance to set national policy, but also the spoils that come with victory -- the chance to appoint thousands of people to jobs in his administration, from confidential secretaries to cabinet secretaries. And the White House is far from the only place where the desks are now piled high with rsums. From K Street to Capitol Hill, Washington is in a state of flux remarkable even for a capital that has come to expect a good deal of turnover in the months after a national election. Not only did the presidency itself change hands, but the protracted way in which the election was decided added more uncertainty and delay to the job-hunting process.

VJust before leaving his room to meet the youngsters he tutors in math and science, Emerson Avila opened a drawer filled with jet-black bandannas that sparkled in the sunlight streaming past the blinds. Reaching deep into the pile, Mr. Avila, 21, pulled out a tattered red bandanna that had been buried in the drawer for 13 months. ''I don't wear the red one anymore,'' he said, exhaling as he tossed it back in the pile. ''It's a painful reminder of the days when I was running crazy through the streets of this city.''

VSITTING in the Philadelphia 76ers' locker room in Madison Square Garden last night, fiddling with a new, bright red pair of sneakers, Allen Iverson said, No, he wasn't talking before the game. After all, it was implied, he needed all his energy to contemplate the game in about an hour against the Knicks. But when someone nearby mentioned that he had just been named the National Basketball Association's player of the month, Iverson piped up, ''I'll comment on that.'' And so he did, beginning with, ''I'll just say the same thing I said the last time.'' And went off thanking his teammates, his family, his hometown fans, maybe even the vendors.

VIN their 1996 film ''Forgotten Silver,'' the directors Peter Jackson and Costa Botes tell the story of Colin McKenzie, a plucky New Zealander who, as a young man in the early years of the 20th century, built a bicycle-powered movie camera, with which he captured history's first tracking shot and made his own film stock out of flax leaves. McKenzie didn't really exist, however -- ''Silver'' is a meticulously made mockumentary that fooled viewers when it was first broadcast on television in New Zealand. But his story symbolizes the spirit of his country and its film industry. Because of New Zealand's geographical isolation, its filmmakers have always had to do things the hard way.

VNEW YORK MANHATTAN: HEATING BILL AID -- Senator Charles E. Schumer said yesterday that he would propose expanding a federal program that helps the poor pay heating bills. Mr. Schumer said he would seek to increase the budget of the program, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, to $2 billion from $1.4 billion. About 676,000 New York households use the program, he said, but tens of thousands have been denied assistance because it is running out of money as energy costs have risen. Dexter Filkins (NYT)

VDIRTY HAVANA TRILOGY By Pedro Juan Gutirrez Translated by Natasha Wimmer. 392 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25. The Cuban ''new man,'' that dream of revolutionary idealists and cynical bureaucrats, would appear to be the main target of ''Dirty Havana Trilogy,'' Pedro Juan Gutirrez's lewd, impious and brilliant novel of contemporary Cuba. Mr. Gutirrez's main character and narrator, whose name, like the author's, is Pedro Juan, drifts through the soulless wreckage bequeathed by 40 years of socialist revolution. His life serves as a kind of exhibit, a corrosive parody of the official, prettified versions of human nature.

VThere was the Christmas morning in 1996 that he spent, pretty much at the end of his rope, awkwardly trying to steal crack cocaine from a curbside dealer who pulled a gun on him. But that was not enough to get him out of the junkie's life. Nor was the time a dealer working out of an abandoned elevator shaft on the Lower East Side of Manhattan put a knife to his throat. Not even when a 300-pound fellow inmate strung out on PCP chased him around a Manhattan holding pen singing the theme from ''I Love Lucy.'' Not until a strange, dark kind of miracle occurred in July 1997, said Stephen Gaghan, did he finally hit the wall and realize that he had to change his life or die.

VAttorney General John Ashcroft said tonight that he was surprised by President's Bill Clinton's pardon of the financier Marc Rich. ''A pardon should be reserved for a situation where there is a manifest sense of injustice,'' Mr. Ashcroft said on CNN's ''Larry King Live.'' ''The American people are troubled whenever they think a pardon would be associated with political support or financial support.'' Mr. Rich, who now lives in Switzerland, fled the United States in 1983 when federal prosecutors charged him with 51 counts of tax fraud and other illegal dealings. The pardon had been requested by Mr. Rich's former wife, Denise, who has given Democrats about $1 million since 1993. Mr. Clinton has denied political or financial motivation.

VA second witness testified yesterday that the hip-hop mogul Sean Combs was holding a gun during a Manhattan nightclub shooting, and, unlike previous witnesses, did not waver from this statement during more than two hours of vigorous cross-examination by Mr. Combs's lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. The witness, Julius Jones, 28, who was at Club New York on West 43rd Street on Dec. 27, 1999, said that a fight between a man at the bar and Mr. Combs's entourage escalated, and that he then saw Mr. Combs with a a black automatic ''in his hand.''

VNEW YORK MANHATTAN: MAN DIES AFTER FIRE -- A man living in a single-room-occupancy hotel in Harlem died after a fire there early yesterday, officials said. Six other residents were injured in the blaze, which started after the man, Frank Powell, 74, used a solvent in his room and then smoked, the authorities said. Mr. Powell was pronounced dead at North General Hospital after suffering a heart attack there, the authorities said. The two-alarm blaze at the Cecil Hotel on West 118th Street took firefighters nearly 40 minutes to control. One resident, Emma Carr, 90, was in critical condition yesterday at Harlem Hospital. The five others were treated and released. Diane Cardwell (NYT) ALBANY: DROP IN PRISON POPULATION -- The Pataki administration is projecting that the state's prison population will have fallen by 2,400 inmates at the end of the current fiscal year, on March 31. Glenn S. Goord, the commissioner of correctional services, told legislators on Monday that the population had already dropped by 1,700. Officials said they expected an additional drop of 4,200 inmates between April 2001 and March 2002. It has been 27 years since the last decrease in New York's prison population, which now stands at just over 70,000 inmates. (AP)

VHarried police detectives in dozens of rural areas in Eastern states are combating what they say is a growing wave of drug abuse involving a potent painkiller prescribed for terminal cancer patients and other people with severe pain. Illicit dealers have used suffering patients as well as fakers, the authorities report, to ''doctor shop'' to obtain the drug, OxyContin, for resale. Addicts favor the drug because they have learned to circumvent its slow time-released protection and achieve a sudden, powerful morphine-like high.

VIT was Sunday evening at an open-air community party in the Cidade de Deus (City of God), one of the most dangerous housing projects in Rio. DJ Marlboro, two cell phones in hand, moved through the crowd. A pregnant woman asked him to kiss her belly, beautiful dancers gave him their phone numbers and a 9-year-old begged him for a recording contract. On a makeshift stage, Bonde do Tigro, four teenage boys in matching caps and basketball jerseys, dropped to their stomach and ground their hips suggestively against the floor as women in the audience responded with the type of squeals usually reserved for the Backstreet Boys.

VSELF-HELP NATION The Long Overdue, Entirely Justified, Delightfully Hostile Guide to the Snake-Oil Peddlers Who Are Sapping Our Nation's Soul By Tom Tiede 224 pages. Atlantic Monthly Press. $23. The journalist Tom Tiede's new book on America's mania for self-help manuals and ''success coaches'' takes on a topic that seems like a slam-dunk for parody or satire or even indignant analysis, and it somehow manages to deliver a screed that's even more annoying than its subject. Mr. Tiede's book turns out to be everything he accuses self-help books of being and worse: it's self-important, sanctimonious and poorly written; it uses random anecdotes to make absurd generalizations; and it devolves into a loony editorial rant about everything from marijuana to United States foreign policy in the Balkans.

Here was this otherwise conservative Republican borrowing a hefty page from the left-wing playbook, urging that possession laws be liberalized, that drug users get rehabilitation rather than prison terms, that pharmacies be allowed to provide syringes to addicts.

VStates' Pardons Now Looked At In Starker Light
p3500
ssVabstract
p3501
VGovernors' pardons come under increased scrutiny in aftermath of Pres Clinton's controversial pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich; sweeping power of governors to grant leniency is receiving heightened degree of attention, particularly those pardons that involve accusations of favoritism or unvarnished politics; there have been few accusations of corruption involving governors' pardons in recent years, but experts on clemency say history shows potential for abuse exists in process that often takes place out of public view; say most controversial pardons tend to be last-minute ones; photos (M)

V''As trendy as fashion people are, they do not have the trendiest or most underground taste in music,'' said Lady Bunny, the downtown drag personality, who never saw a sausage curl she could resist. Lady Bunny is perhaps best known as the force behind Wigstock, the annual Labor Day drag festival, but much of the time she is sought after as a D.J. That is what she was doing at the party for the 10th anniversary of the fashion magazine Visionaire at the beginning of Fashion Week.

VANN PATCHETT Her fourth novel, ''Bel Canto,'' will be published in June by Harper Collins. ''My first night at Sarah Lawrence, a girl knocked on my door and asked me if I wanted to go to CBGB's. After the club closed, her plan was to walk around until dawn and then take the train back. When she knocked, it was 10 o'clock at night and I was already in bed asleep, which is why I don't live in New York. The city is up all night and I'm not. Everyone I work with and almost everyone I love lives in New York. I fly back to visit, but I have never thought I was hip enough, rich enough or focused enough to live there. In Nashville, I am one of about three novelists, so doing my job takes on a sense of importance. In New York, I would wake up knowing that 750,000 people were already hard at work on their novels and that their novels were better than mine. Not living in New York is wonderful because no matter how often I visit, my friends are happy to see me, my agent takes me someplace very nice for lunch, and the whole place looks gorgeous and thrilling in a way I imagine it would not if I had to look at it every day.''

VVivian Cabey stood on the stone porch of 60 West 129th Street, collecting her breath and her children after a bruising day at work. On this fall night, darkness had reached the block before she had, and ominous shadows played around her. Like Stygian guides, young men flitted in and out of the building with crackheads in tow. Mrs. Cabey barked that she would beat them or call the police. They kowtowed -- ''You know we respect you more than anyone on the block, Mrs. Cabey'' -- but the traffic continued.

VThere are quick moments when there isn't a trace of character in the handsome, apple-cheeked face of the actor Stephen Barker Turner, and they are more unsettling than any focused words or gestures. Mr. Turner plays a German medical student named Peter Karlanner in the Classic Stage Company's studious production of ''Race,'' Ferdinand Bruckner's anguished warning cry of a play from 1933. Peter is a young man who is quickly shedding his sense of himself, and the expression that abruptly seizes his features every so often isn't so much of confusion as of utter emptiness. For a few seconds, between scenes of loud declamation and violent action, that vacant look is a thing of terror. It so clearly belongs to a man waiting, willing to be transformed -- in this case, by a fast-growing political movement called the National Socialist Party.

VThe Supreme Court wrestled today with how to apply the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches to a technological development the Constitution's framers most likely did not have in mind: a thermal imaging device that the police can use from outside a home to detect patterns of heat being generated from inside. The specific question in the hourlong argument was whether use of a thermal imager by the police is a search that, no less than an actual entry into a house, requires a warrant. The underlying question was how the Constitution should take account not only of changing technology but also of society's changing understanding of technology's threat to privacy.

VAmerican teenagers are far more likely than their European peers to use marijuana and other illicit drugs, but European teenagers are more likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol, according to a study of 31 nations. The study, released yesterday at a meeting of the World Health Organization in Stockholm, compared the results of 1999 surveys answered anonymously by 14,000 10th-grade students in the United States and 95,000 10th-grade students in 30 European countries.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-9 Crackdown on bin Laden Leads to Arrests in Europe More than a dozen Islamic militants have been arrested in Germany and Britain, and American officials say some were plotting terror attacks in Europe and elsewhere. The arrests are part of a crackdown on a network with ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi radical accused of plotting the bombing of two American embassies in Africa in 1998. A1 Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, once an aide to Mr. bin Laden, testified in New York City that he had offered Saudi officials a plan to assassinate Mr. bin Laden, and later discussed it with American officials. He did not disclose the American response. B3

VThird article in series An American Block: Life on 129th Street discusses how diverse residents of block between Fifth and Lenox Avenues negotiate relationships across class, racial and ethnic divides and personal experiences; Michelle Ramirez, black student and singer raised in Greenwich Village, lives on block where she openly and loudly challenges drug hustlers, which reveals how far block has come since 1994, when The New York Times chronicled bleak, ominous street; photos; such social changes are playing out across Harlem, where vast amount of vacant housing means that perhaps 40,000 new residents could be absorbed without displacing anyone; Harlem has so far defied familiar gentrification process, in which lighter or wealthier newcomers push out locals, so that on 129th Street blacks are learning to live alongside whites, and blacks who share nothing but skin color must build a community (L)

VThe easiest way to choose a play title is simply to name the characters or surface subject matter (''Art,'' ''The Lion King,'' ''Vampire Lesbians of Sodom''). It's harder and rarer to express the work's larger meaning (though ''Proof'' actually does both). So Deb Margolin might have called her new play ''How Professional Basketball Got Me Through Hodgkin's Disease.'' The title she chose instead is ''Three Seconds in the Key,'' which basketball fans know refers to the length of time a player whose team has the ball can stay under the basket. As Ms. Margolin has pointed out in interviews, this requires the player to dance in and out of the area before making the shot.

VOn the surface, the Atlanta Hawks, the Detroit Pistons and the Washington Wizards parted with much better players than they received at Thursday's trading deadline. But the Hawks did not hand Philadelphia the National Basketball Association championship by trading Dikembe Mutombo for Theo Ratliff and Toni Kukoc, among other players, for no reason. And the Pistons did not swap Jerome Williams for Toronto's Corliss Williamson with the notion that they were being duped.

VMarcus Cox, a Connecticut basketball reserve, was arrested last week in Storrs, Conn., on a marijuana possession charge after a vehicle driven by Jack Wolfinger, a former St. John's player, was stopped by the police, The Associated Press said yesterday. Coach Jim Calhoun suspended Cox after the arrest Thursday night. Wolfinger was upset after not playing in St. John's game last Sunday with Duke and left the team after speaking with Coach Mike Jarvis on Tuesday.

VThe hero of an Alan Furst novel has everything a man could desire: the best wines and cigars, beautiful women. He's like Leslie Howard, Joseph Cotten and Jean Gabin all rolled into one, returning from dangerous missions and being immediately gathered into the arms of women in delicate lingerie. He also exists in a specific atmosphere of rainy Mitteleuropean melancholy found mainly in spy movies. Documents are passed in the shadows; violins sound with the sweet, sad music of nostalgia. Hungarian counts have great estates. Trains head into the night carrying spies and assassins, whistles echoing off mountainsides.

VJack Wolfinger, who left St. John's basketball team last week, drove a vehicle belonging to another former Red Storm player, but that will not prompt a National Collegiate Athletic Association investigation, university officials said yesterday. Ed Manetta, St. John's athletic director, said the N.C.A.A. has known for months that Wolfinger, who left the team because of a lack of playing time, was occasionally driving a vehicle owned by Ron Artest. Artest left St. John's for the National Basketball Association two years ago.

VThe domestic intelligence agency unexpectedly said today that an American graduate student, arrested nearly a month ago on seemingly minor drug charges, was probably working for United States military intelligence. The arrest of the student, John Edward Tobbin, a Fulbright scholar who is believed to be 23 or 24, drew almost no notice when it was reported two weeks ago in Moscow newspapers here. But today the Federal Security Service, the domestic successor to the K.G.B., said that Mr. Tobbin had studied Russian at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif., and had been trained in interrogation at the Army military intelligence training center in Fort Huachuca, Ariz.

VNEW YORK MANHATTAN: CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL PASSES The City Council yesterday overwhelmingly passed an amended campaign finance law that provides $4 in city money for every $1 raised by a political candidate. The 40-to-4 vote appeared to make moot a lawsuit by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who sued last month to throw out the 4-to-1 formula, which he has declared too expensive. ''You can't allow the mayor to dictate your agenda,'' said the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone. Mr. Giuliani has pledged to veto the bill, but Council members have the votes to override it. Elisabeth Bumiller ALDEN: RAPPER BEGINS SENTENCE The rap performer DMX, left, has begun serving a 15-day jail sentence for driving without a license. DMX, whose real name is Earl Simmons, surrendered at the Erie County Correctional Facility in Alden. His lawyer, Mark Mahoney, said that with an automatic one-third reduction of the sentence and credit for the day of his arrest, Mr. Simmons would probably be released in about a week. DMX, who was nominated for two Grammy awards this year, pleaded guilty to driving without a license, marijuana possession and two unpaid parking tickets. (AP)

VThe authorities in this border town today discovered a cache of illegal drugs inside yet another hand-dug tunnel connected to a sewer line that smugglers had used to get drugs out of Mexico and into the United States. About 350 pounds of marijuana was pulled out of a hole in the concrete floor of a commercial garage less than a mile from the Mexican border. It was a modest discovery by any measure, worth only $300,000 or so on the street, said James A. Woolley, assistant special agent at the Drug Enforcement Administration's offices in Tucson.

VMike Tyson circled the three-tiered water fountain in the foyer of his mansion and pointed up toward two large murals painted on the second-floor walls. Stretching across an earth-tone background were the faces and poses of boxing's greatest champions, who stand as a daily inspiration for one of the most troubled heavyweights of all time. Tellingly, Tyson has included himself in the montage, albeit in modest proportion. Yet as he eagerly waits for another chance at the heavyweight title, the 34-year-old Tyson has begun to wonder about his own legacy and his place in history.

They use marijuana grown in the United States, do not need treatment, and are educated about the risks of cannabis use. They hold jobs; they raise children; they pay taxes. They are indistinguishable from their friends, colleagues and neighbors, except that they occasionally smoke cannabis.

VThe Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches was crafted by the Constitution's framers to create a barrier against government intrusions on Americans' privacy. An important case argued recently in the Supreme Court tests the continued vitality of that protection in the face of high-tech snooping devices that make it increasingly possible to monitor activities inside a person's home without any physical intrusion. The case concerns a thermal imaging device used by federal officers in Oregon to confirm their suspicion that a man was illegally growing marijuana. The device detected the distinctive heat pattern generated by high-intensity lamps used to accelerate the growth of the plants. At issue is whether the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by failing to obtain a warrant before aiming the thermal imager at the house.

VHe was a skinny kid, new in town, a boy from a broken home with his share of troubles. He rode a skateboard, but was no good at stunts, and the bigger kids in the park where he hung out and smoked joints stole his board, and even his shoes, as if for sport, some who knew him said today. He was also funny, sweet-faced and fond of pranks, good with words and able to make people laugh easily. He got picked on, but not so much more than any other teenager in a world where adolescent cruelty is the norm.

VAUGUSTA, GONE A True Story By Martha Tod Dudman 254 pages. Simon & Schuster. $23. Martha Tod Dudman remembers when the other parents in her small Maine community used to exchange baby pictures. Then, years later, they moved on to sharing complaints at the local baseball games about homework or messy bedrooms. ''The last time I went to a game,'' she writes, ''we went over the usual: eating disorders, worries about drugs, staying out late, driving, drinking and driving. I didn't dare introduce the next tier: stealing, staying out all night, hitchhiking to Boston, screaming at the top of her lungs, holding up a knife one time, holding it up and looking at me, telling me what she would like to do with it -- my daughter! My daughter! My girl.''

VHere again are the echoes of Littleton and Springfield and Conyers, the chorus of whys from the mostly white, mostly middle-class families, directed this time at Santana High School, at the corner of Carefree and Magnolia. The geography of wide streets that lead to dead ends at the edge of construction sites, and roomy houses so new the mud has yet to dry on the sheetrock, is largely the same. And so is the week's refrain -- this is a safe haven, these are the best schools, the best people, the best neighborhoods scratched from farmland at the far urban frontier.

VSantee Is Latest Blow to Myth Of Suburbia's Safer Schools
p5818
ssVabstract
p5819
VShooting spree by student at Santana High School brings chorus of whys from the mostly white, mostly middle-class families of Santee, California, echoing stunned reaction in recent years of some other supposedly safe suburban residents who believed that 'it can't happen here'; child psychiatrists, educators and other researchers have been asking similar questions since teenagers began shooting other teenagers at suburban high schools in last five years; their explanations point to easy availability of guns, but they also wonder whether violent student outbursts are byproducts of communities themselves, where children come and go as they please, and where ups and downs of student life and cliques are magnified by school's position as center of the local universe; also noted is suburban schools' reluctance to institute intrusive security measures, like metal detectors and security guards; photo (M)

VEUROPE ITALY: ELECTION DATE SET The government announced that Italians would vote for a new prime minister on May 13. The campaign between the leader of a center-left coalition, Francesco Rutelli, 46, left, who was mayor of Rome, and Italy's center-right opposition leader, Silvio Berlusconi, 64, a media and business tycoon, has been acrimonious, with even the exact date for elections the subject of bitter fighting. Alessandra Stanley (NYT) SWITZERLAND: LEGALIZING MARIJUANA The government has proposed legislation that would permit consumption of marijuana and hashish, acting on findings of a study that showed use of the substances is pervasive. Under the proposed law, the police could ignore cultivation and trading of small amounts of soft drugs and devote more resources to large-scale production and export. The legislation faces scrutiny by Parliament, where passage is far from certain. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)

VNearly two months after he pledged to loosen the state's strict mandatory sentencing laws for drug offenders, Gov. George E. Pataki released a detailed bill yesterday that would reduce prison sentences in some instances but would also add new penalties for marijuana convictions. He also wants to reduce the state parole board's authority to grant early release from prison. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has long campaigned against parole in general. He has ended parole for those convicted of repeated violent felonies. He has pushed to end parole for all felons, though that has failed to pass the Assembly.

V''All Hail the New Puritans'' is the name of an anthology of short stories that occasioned much comment when it was published in Britain last year by a group of young writers calling themselves the New Puritans. The title refers partly to Protestantism, partly to punk rock -- the phrase comes from a song by the British band the Fall that calls for the apocalyptic cleansing of a decadent world -- but the best way to read it is as a command. As generations of angry young men have done before them, the New Puritans (who are, indeed, mostly men) are throwing down their gauntlet to the British literary establishment. The establishment has stooped to pick it up, as it never fails to do, and the reviews have been plentiful and negative. To heighten the tension, the editors -- the tough-guy crime writer Nicholas Blincoe, 36, and the rave-scene novelist Matt Thorne, 27 -- required their contributors to sign a 10-point manifesto implicitly modeled on the one issued by the filmmakers of Dogma 95. The British writers, like their Danish counterparts, are iconoclasts. They eschew artiness; they demand no-frills narrative; they reject rhetorical devices and authorial asides. Since ''published works'' are also ''fragments of our time,'' contemporary fiction must be ''set in the present day.'' Cultural references must be to real products, places or things. ''Textual simplicity'' is the desired effect, and that means no flashbacks or flash-forwards or fancy punctuation.

VROBERT MITCHUM 'Baby, I Don't Care' By Lee Server Illustrated. 590 pages. St. Martin's Press. $32.50. Jane Greer, Robert Mitchum's co-star in the great film noir ''Out of the Past,'' once had the temerity to seat him next to William Faulkner at dinner. ''I really like the way that boy talks,'' Faulkner said afterward, and no wonder. Mitchum was a walking antidote to pretension, a natural-born hipster whose diffidence made for wild surprises wherever he went. He would bait anybody, especially the press. Once, the director Edward Dmytryk recalled: ''One old lady said to him, 'What is your favorite pastime, Mr. Mitchum?' I won't tell you what he answered, but it stopped her dead.''

VAssembly Democratic leaders offered their proposal to loosen New York's stringent drug sentencing laws today, calling for the expansion of treatment options for drug offenders, for a reduction in the range of mandatory minimum sentences and for more discretion for judges to decide which drug felons should be given treatment rather than prison. The proposal, drafted by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's office and shared with the Democratic conference this afternoon, goes considerably further than the legislation Gov. George E. Pataki offered Friday. The new plan lays the groundwork for a battle expected to unfold over the rewriting of New York's Rockefeller-era drug laws. By all accounts, the chances of amending the laws are better this year than ever before, in large part because of Governor Pataki's pledge to do so.

VTHE three young people came from Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn, and what they had in common was that one or both of their parents had spent years in prison under the 1973 Rockefeller drug laws. Those laws set stiff penalties for drug possession and use, swelling the state prison population to 70,000 today from 13,000 in 1973. On Tuesday, as part of the Drop the Rock campaign to repeal the laws, about 35 children are to go before legislators in Albany to tell their stories.

VWith last week's unveiling by Assembly Democratic leaders of their proposal to reform New York's harsh Rockefeller-era drug laws, the fight for serious drug-sentencing reform has been joined in Albany. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and his colleagues did not summon the courage to address reform until Gov. George Pataki spoke out on the issue. But they have now produced a stronger and more promising package than the governor's. There is no good reason that a solid compromise cannot be achieved this session. Though there are differences between the Pataki and Silver programs, there is also a broad, bipartisan consensus among lawmakers that expanding the state's drug treatment programs would be a cheaper and more effective strategy than continuing to pack the prisons with low-level drug users.

VThe National Hockey League and the United States Olympic Committee have agreed on a potential resolution of their disagreement about drug testing for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, said Bill Daly, the league's chief counsel, and Scott Blackmun, acting chief executive for the Olympic committee. Under the terms of the agreement, the World Anti-Doping Association will test all N.H.L. players in the Olympics, regardless of which country they play for, satisfying the league's concern about consistent testing, Daly and Blackmun said.

VThe Contender Surviving sappy dialogue and ridiculous plot developments, Rod Lurie's film rides on Jeff Bridges as the over-the-top President Jackson Evans and Joan Allen (left) as Senator Laine Hanson. (Both are Oscar nominees, Mr. Bridges for best supporting actor and Ms. Allen for best actress.) When the vice president dies, Evans appoints Hanson, whose confirmation is tripped up over accusations that she took part in a sex frolic in college. Her portrait, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ''is an exquisitely subtle study of a strong, high-principled woman pushed to the breaking point.'' 2000. DreamWorks. R. $108.97; DVD, $29.99. 132 minutes. Closed captioned.

VAfter 24 years of operating one of the world's largest natural gas fields in one of Indonesia's most restive provinces, Exxon Mobil decided this month that it had had enough. It wasn't so much the pressure -- it was the commute. Some 50 times since 1999, gunmen have hijacked the company's pickups and vans on their way to or from sites in northern Aceh province. Twice last year, company airplanes were hit by ground fire as they tried to land nearby.

'' Sprewell cursed, flexed, posed and did everything but employ the middle finger against an equally unruly Golden State Warriors crowd at the Arena here in November 1999 in his first visit since the P.

VAlthough the Supreme Court is usually solicitous of states' rights, that attitude appeared today to stop well short of endorsing the medical use of marijuana, which California voters authorized in a 1996 referendum despite a federal law that considers marijuana to have ''no currently accepted medical use.'' Two lower federal courts in California have held that a marijuana distribution center in Oakland could invoke ''medical necessity'' as a defense against the federal government's effort to get an injunction to stop the operation of the ''cannabis clubs.'' The clubs sprang up around the state after passage of California's Proposition 215, entitled the Compassionate Use Act.

VNancy Stouffer was a homemaker living a quiet life in Camp Hill, Pa., until two years ago, when she heard about J. K. Rowling's novel ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.'' As soon as she read it, Mrs. Stouffer said last week, ''I realized there was big trouble here.'' Mrs. Stouffer herself had pursued a quixotic career writing children's picture books -- one that included a bespectacled boy named Larry Potter and another that, like Ms. Rowling's book, was populated by characters called ''muggles.'' Mrs. Stouffer said she was sure that she recognized several crucial elements from her own work.

VWhen a man claims that he and God together can cure AIDS, crowds will gather. On a recent Sunday, 1,500 people, maybe more, crammed into pews, stood in the aisles, even perched atop the church's cinder block walls to watch as one of the sick walked forward. He was thin, like a rake belted to a pair of pinstriped pants. ''This man has only a month to live,'' said the Rev. John Nduati, a Protestant minister who has attracted a large following for a 27-year-old preacher. He squeezed the sick man's forearm between his thumb and forefinger: ''What if these bones could get meat?''

VThe New York Police Department employs 465 captains, the group of senior officers from which its most prominent and powerful commanders are selected. You can count the number of black men in captains' uniforms on two hands. There are nine. In 1990, 7.7 percent of the department's sergeants were black men. Since then, the proportion of black men working as these front-line supervisors has fallen by more than a quarter, to 5.7 percent.

VFor Black Officers, Diversity Has Its Limits

VSpecial report, The Blues, on failure of New York City Police Department to diversify ranks with more blacks in front-line positions, one of its most important personnel objectives; makeup of nation's largest police department has undergone unmistakeable change after generation of diversifying and has come closer to resembling city; proportion of women in uniform has risen more than sixfold since 1974, with real advances even among black women; Hispanic representation has increased by nearly 500 percent; even so, advances have largely excluded black men, especially from frontline supervisory positions of sergeant and captain, and from elite commands; approximately 7.7 percent of department's sergeants were black in 1990, but proportion has since fallen by more than quarter, to 5.7 percent; prestigious commands remain almost entirely white; personnel data show proportion of black males in uniform increased to 9.2 percent from 7.7 percent since 1974, but that modest increase was almost entirely result of merger with better-integrated housing and transit departments; many black policemen have been hampered in getting promotions by Civil Service rules, over which department has limited control; since many local young black men lack requisite education, they do not qualify for Police Academy, and most who qualify express little interest in attending academy; recruiting drives have also been undermined by departments tactics and reputation as strong perception exists among police policies are overly aggressive and racially driven; department's commitment to greater integration has been uneven; has in recent years used money earmarked to create minority-recruiting unit for other uses, refused to document its performance to auditors and done little to redress virtual segregation of elite commands; consistent calls for police integration since early 1960's, endorsed in 1968 report on race by federal Kerner Commission, discussed; charts; photo (M)

VJohnny Depp has the kind of face that justifies the existence of cinema. You would have to go back to the young Montgomery Clift, or perhaps to Greta Garbo herself, to find facial bone structure so perfectly suited to the shimmering subliity of the screen. Yes, Mr. Depp is a gifted actor, but his talent for dramatic understatement is sometimes overwhelmed by his sheer charisma. Though he makes even dull films watchable -- you can't take your eyes off him -- his enigmatic reserve can make everyone else look like a shameless ham. When he's paired with a first-class Actors Studio emoter like Al Pacino (in Mike Newell's ''Donnie Brasco'') or Marlon Brando (in Jeremy Leven's ''Don Juan DeMarco'') the effect can be electrifying. But when, in Ted Demme's new film ''Blow,'' he stands by as Penelope Cruz throws a coked-out hissy fit, you feel a little embarrassed for both of them.

VThe government of President Vicente Fox has made its first important drug arrests since taking power five months ago. Unfortunately for Mexican drug enforcement, the three men arrested were an Army brigadier general, a captain and a lieutenant. Brig. Gen. Ricardo Martnez, who commanded the 21st Motorized Cavalry Regiment based in Nuevo Laredo, on the Texas border, and his aides, Capt. Pedro Maya and Lt. Javier Quevedo, were imprisoned late Thursday at a military base in Mexico City. The three officers are charged with having provided protection from arrest in return for payoffs from cocaine and marijuana traffickers operating along the gulf coast. They face sentences of up to 40 years if convicted on drugs and weapons charges.

There the officer confronted one Nancy Lee Kern, a seemingly innocent artist with a messy studio and a clean record. It wouldn't be clean for long.

VA New Jersey state trooper told a State Senate committee today that racism pervades the upper ranks of the state police and persists in troopers' conduct on the road despite years of federal oversight and new operating procedures. ''There are a lot who feel that people of color or Hispanics are the ones likely to be carrying drugs,'' said Sgt. Vincent Bellaran, who won a bias suit against the agency and is pursuing another case charging that superiors then retaliated against him.

V''I'm a better person than I used to be'' may seem the exclusive mantra of former presidents, chastened lovers and veterans of the analytic couch. But if a series of studies by two social psychologists offers any indication, the conviction that today's self is a new and improved version of yesterday's is, in fact, ubiquitous. Asked to evaluate themselves in the past and in the present, the researchers found, the subjects in their studies consistently reported that they were now more competent, more socially skilled, more tolerant, more polite, more mature and less boring than they had been in the past.

VWEST HAWAII: DECISION ON SUBMARINE IS REPORTED DUE The commander of the United States Pacific Fleet will be told on Saturday what, if any, disciplinary action has been recommended against officers of the submarine Greeneville in the sinking of the Japanese fishing trawler Ehime Maru, a Navy official says. The official said yesterday that Adm. Thomas Fargo, the fleet commander, would be in San Diego to receive the report of the panel that held a court of inquiry on the accident, which killed nine people off Hawaii on Feb. 9. (AP) ROCKIES MONTANA: BODYGUARD FOR GOVERNOR After becoming the first woman elected governor in Montana last November, Judy Martz could well become the state's first governor to have a bodyguard. Her administration is asking the Legislature for $80,000 to provide her protection. Her chief of staff, Ed Bartlett, said he noticed at a recent governors' meeting in Washington that all the other governors had bodyguards. Michael Janofsky (NYT)

But once Coleman begins to talk about Red Sox Manager Jimy Williams and relates his side of their conversations, he lapses into the present tense and alters his pronouns and suddenly it's as if he were in Williams's office again, and he were speaking directly to his manager. ''He didn't have the nerve to look me in the eye and tell me why I was being sent down,'' said Coleman. ''You hold your head down the whole time. You weren't man enough to look me in the eye.''

VOn a fiercely rainy night in March, a small group of people ventured out and gathered in a coffee shop in Manhattan to break the law. They all had an incurable disease. And they all believed that smoking marijuana helped them cope. These people, with illnesses ranging from AIDS to aggressive arthritis, meet weekly to buy marijuana in the relative safety of a club that they say is a lifeline.

VThe National Football League draft is the ultimate sports auction in which teams weave maniacally precise measurements and psychological evaluations into a strategic blueprint meant to cover every possible contingency. Then again, the process occasionally winds to a simple conclusion: a team is smitten with one or two players. For months, even though the Giants had the undesirable penultimate pick of the first round, they still believed they would get one of several highly rated cornerbacks. But in the last 10 days, the thinking of the Giants' brain trust was transformed.

VPRISON overcrowding in Connecticut is a story about numbers. It's about big numbers, like the more than $25,000 per year it costs taxpayers to house each of almost 18,000 inmates. It's about little numbers, too, like the three sons of a New Haven mother, Barbara Fair, who are part of the disproportionately high percentage of black men behind bars. Ten years ago, the state took steps to curb the growth of its prison population by setting up a variety of alternative programs for nonviolent offenders, particularly those whose crimes involved drug use. Now these programs, like the prisons, are filled to capacity and beyond. Both the Legislature and Gov. John G. Rowland are determined to wrestle with the problem this year.

VLuiz Fernando da Costa, who rose from a slum-dwelling drug peddler to become Brazil's most notorious cocaine lord, was arrested in the Colombian jungle today after a massive manhunt by army troops, the armed forces reported today. Mr. da Costa's arrest came in dramatic fashion, after a Cessna in which he was a traveling on Thursday in southeastern Colombia was forced down by a Colombian Air Force fighter. Mr. da Costa fled on foot with four other men, and the pilot of the plane later identified one of the men as Mr. da Costa. That triggered a manhunt involving 300 army troops who eventually cornered him in Vichada Province near the Venezuelan border.

VFor eight years, Alan G. Hevesi has been the city comptroller, making him one of just three elected citywide officials in New York. He has a sprawling fifth-floor office in the Municipal Building with a view of a wide sweep of southern Manhattan, an 800-person staff, a $56.8 million budget, a security contingent and a car with a driver. He has, in short, the kind of platform that should make him a visible power in the daily political life of New York. But Mr. Hevesi, 61, a Democratic candidate for mayor, has hardly been visible these last seven years. By design or by nature, he has settled for the side of the stage during his two terms in office, tending to his job as the city's chief financial officer, but mostly steering clear of the daily dust-ups of City Hall. He has largely avoided encounters with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, even as his Democratic colleagues have enthusiastically chased them.

VEUROPE RUSSIA: AMERICAN'S TRIAL OPENS The trial of an American on drug charges opened in Voronezh, in central Russia. John Tobin, left, a 24-year-old Fulbright scholar, faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted. He denies any wrongdoing and says marijuana found in his apartment was planted by the police. The security force also says he was training to be a spy, but admits there are no grounds to prosecute him. (Reuters) VATICAN CITY: ARMENIAN IS 'MARTYR' The Vatican proclaimed an Armenian Catholic bishop who was killed in 1915 and 26 Ukrainians who died in Communist persecutions to be martyrs, the first step toward sainthood. The honor for Ignace Maloyan, archbishop of Mardin, Turkey, came on the day that Armenians commemorate the deaths of hundreds of thousands in what they say was an Ottoman campaign to force them out of eastern Turkey. Turkey says that the toll is inflated and that Armenians were killed or resettled as the empire tried to quell unrest. The Ukrainians were killed during anti-church campaigns by Ukraine's former Communist rulers. (AP)

VPresident Bush plans to name John P. Walters, a law-and-order conservative who was harshly critical of the Clinton administration's efforts against illegal narcotics, as the drug czar, Bush administration officials said today. Mr. Walters, who was the top deputy to William J. Bennett, the drug czar in the last Bush administration, shares Mr. Bennett's emphasis on publicly stigmatizing drugs at home while mobilizing considerable resources -- including the American military -- against narcotics producers abroad.

VWhat has the war on drugs done for Darryl Strawberry and Robert Downey Jr.? Are they better off or worse off? Are they the targets or the victims? Should they be thankful or regretful? The war on drugs is really a war on people -- on anyone who uses or grows or makes or sells a forbidden drug. It essentially consists of two elements: the predominant role of criminalization of all things having to do with marijuana, cocaine, heroin, Ecstasy and other prohibited drugs and the presumption that abstinence -- coerced if necessary -- is the only permissible relationship with these drugs. It's that combination that ultimately makes this war unwinnable.

VOp-Ed article by Ethan A Nadelmann, director of drug policy foundation, says war on drugs is unwinnable because of its two combined core elements: criminalization of all things having to do with marijuana, cocaine, heroin, Ecstasy and other prohibited drugs, and presumption that abstinence--coerced if necessary--is only permissible relationship with these drugs; says what is needed is new way of evaluating drug policies by looking at how they reduce crime and suffering; says arresting and punishing pot smokers should be one of lowest priorities; says focus should be on reducing overdose deaths, cutting numbers of nonviolent drug offenders behind bars, and wasting less taxpayer money on ineffective criminal policies (M)

V''Breathe!'' screamed Aaron Hagan. Before him in a basement rehearsal hall at the Blue Heron Arts Center on East 24th Street was a restless horde, two dozen adolescents and one 10-year-old. ''All my dreams are/Risin' high,'' they sang. The group was rehearsing ''Best Friends,'' a play that they helped create, commissioned by City Lights Youth Theater, a nonprofit drama education program for schoolchildren. Opening tomorrow night, the play will run this weekend and May 3 to May 6 at the Blue Heron. City Lights was founded in 1990 by Myrna K. Greenberg, who had been inspired by the transforming effect that theater had had on her own children. She hired Mr. Hagan, 30, as music director for the play. Also a voice coach for ''The Lion King,'' he helped write ''Best Friends.'' The main writer is Will Holt, 71, chief lyricist for ''The Me Nobody Knows,'' a show based on the words of inner city children that was nominated for a Tony Award in 1970.

Aside from being the first interesting development in the mayoral race, his candidacy raises profound questions for political scientists and seasoned viewers of ''Seinfeld.'' Can he win? Well, maybe that's not such a profound question. Libertarians have historically not been a pivotal factor in mayoral races. But Mr. Kramer can point to one promising precedent.

VWilliam Peterson was the other cornerback the Giants drafted last weekend, the other guy nicknamed Will chosen two rounds after the team took Will Allen of Syracuse in the first round. Allen may have been the Giants' first choice, but Peterson's selection was no less notable, if for a different reason. Peterson arrived as one of those draft picks that carries an explanation, a choice with an addendum. Every account of Peterson mentioned that while he finished his college career at Western Illinois, he had played for two years at Michigan before he was dismissed from the team for disciplinary reasons. It was generally conceded by most National Football League executives, including those from the Giants, that Peterson would have probably been a high first-round draft pick if not for two incidents after his 1998 season at Michigan.

VA court in Voronezh, in southwest Russia, convicted a visiting American Fulbright scholar on drug charges today and sentenced him to 37 months in a penal colony. The verdict puts an official stamp on a seemingly minor marijuana infraction that swerved briefly and in bizarre fashion into suggestions of espionage. But it does not end the case, which now appears headed for an appeal.

VON a mild night in February, Dana Beal, a leader of the Yippies, gave a party in a three-story brick building in the East Village where the quirky anarchistic group has had its headquarters for nearly 30 years. Among the visitors were friends from the 60's and 70's, many known for their radical politics. As several dozen guests chatted and sipped drinks in a long room on the ground floor of the structure, which is located at 9 Bleecker Street, Mr. Beal stood to the side. Dressed in his customary brown leather boots and well-worn corduroy jacket, he identified some of those in attendance. There was Johanna Lawrenson, the companion of Abbie Hoffman, who, along with Jerry Rubin, was a co-founder of the Yippies in 1967. A. J. Weberman, a prominent Yippie and writer who helped pioneer ''garbology'' -- rooting through the trash of public figures like Norman Mailer for journalistic clues -- was there, too, and so was Aron Kay. Mr. Kay, known as the Pie Man, hurled hundreds of pies at politicians and others he disliked, including Jerry Brown, the former California governor, and James L. Buckley, the former New York senator.

VWhen a judge pronounced Russell Selkirk guilty of smoking marijuana in a car in December 1999, Mr. Selkirk, a freshman at Ohio State University, thought he left the courtroom knowing his sentence: a $250 fine, suspension of his driver's license, 20 hours of community service and a year's probation. But a month later, when Mr. Selkirk applied for financial aid for the coming academic year, he faced another sentence, loss of eligibility for low-interest federal education loans and grants. ''I was amazed,'' said the student from Cincinnati. ''It's like two penalties for the same crime.''

VAs art worldlings go, there was no one quite like John Powers. Not a born collector, but a naturalized one, so to speak (he was initiated by the publisher Harry Abrams), he became a champion and close friend of artists and an evangelist who spread the collecting gospel to friends, acquaintances and strangers. With his Japanese-born wife, Kimiko, who shared his artistic pursuits, he moved away from the New York scene in the early 1970's to reside in a nirvana of paintings, sculptures, drawings and mountain scenery at Carbondale, Colo. He rarely sold art from his holdings (which included a major group of Japanese antiquities) but lent freely from them, and helped bring prominent artists, along with exhibitions of their work, to Colorado State University.

VAn American student imprisoned on marijuana charges in a southwest Russian city asserted in a handwritten note last month that Russian officials set up his arrest in January, then asked him to conduct unspecified work for them. The note, written by John Tobin, 24, states that Mr. Tobin rejected the proposal for work and added that he expected to remain in jail for some additional time as a result.

VFor his last meal, Victor Feguer asked for an olive, just one olive, pit and all. He expressed hope that others would avoid his fate, said the priests who spent some of his last hours with him. Soon, chewing gum rapidly, he mounted a scaffold in the auto body shop of an Iowa prison. His thick glasses were removed, a hood was put over his head and he was hanged. ''The sheriff pulled the lever and down dropped Victor,'' recalled John M. Ely Jr., an 82-year-old former Iowa state senator who witnessed the 1963 execution.

VONE night shortly before Christmas, John Edward Tobin visited the Ridgefield home of a high school friend and shared stories about his life in Russia as a Fulbright scholar. The slender, dark-haired 24-year-old whom friends call Jack talked about many things, but in the following months one story would stick out as an eerie foreshadowing of the events that have landed him in a Russian jail.

VHERE they come again. Michael Tolliver, known as Mouse, is still looking for love -- as often as possible -- in the cowboy bars of San Francisco and in the relative anonymity of the baths. His neighbor Mary Ann Singleton, no longer just off the plane from Cleveland, can't decide whether Brian -- as sexually active in the straight world as Mouse is in gay circles -- is the man for her. Their landlady, the late-middle-aged transsexual Anna Madrigal, still smokes marijuana the way others drink wine and still supplies it to those she loves. Anna is a woman of her time: the 1970's. Armistead Maupin's ''Tales of the City'' began as serial fiction in the pages of The San Francisco Chronicle in May 1976, and it brought to life characters that Mr. Maupin could see all around him in that free-spirited time and place. Twenty-five years later, the stories' shock value may have waned, but now, as creatures of period fiction, the people living in the apartments at 28 Barbary Lane on Russian Hill in San Francisco may speak to the present day more than ever.

VIf you didn't know who the interviewer was sitting opposite Paul McCartney in the two-hour documentary ''Wingspan,'' tomorrow night on ABC, you might write her off as a typical entertainment-media sycophant. She's beautiful and a little taken with herself in that I-belong-on-camera way, with sleek, shoulder-length dark hair, great bone structure and a proper BBC voice. She's a lot younger than Sir Paul and is obviously smitten with him at the same time she considers him a relic of some mysterious past age. As film of his 1969 wedding to Linda Eastman is shown, she says, ''She was pregnant with me then.''

VGunmen shot five people in the head, killing three, in a railroad flat above the Carnegie Delicatessen in Midtown last evening as tourists and office workers crowded the streets below. The police said the execution-style killings resulted from a dispute over drugs. People outside scurried for cover into nearby businesses after hearing shots around 7:30 p.m., and police officers in riot gear quickly descended on the block of Seventh Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets, closing it to traffic and scouring the area for the killers and evidence. Crowds quickly massed behind police lines around the deli, a New York institution, once a haunt for comics and Broadway actors but now mostly a tourist stop.

That message, centered on concern for maintaining strategic balances and avoiding a new arms race, echoed skepticism expressed by leaders from London to Berlin and Tokyo to Seoul after a week of American consultations with allies and former adversaries. A6 Push to Expand NATO Roster Leaders of nine former Eastern European Communist states called on NATO to admit their countries at the alliance's summit meeting next year in Prague, despite strong opposition from Russia. Senators Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, endorsed the request. A5

VHer movie-career highlight had been as a featured dancer in ''Dirty Dancing,'' but that 1987 film's success had not done much for Jennifer Stahl. The closest she came to fame was by renting a tired apartment five stories above the Carnegie Delicatessen in Midtown, where tourists come to eat pastrami and marvel at the framed photographs of celebrities that hang on the walls. So Ms. Stahl turned to singing and, the police say, to selling marijuana. She used her apartment to record music as well as to store scales, packaging material and pounds of the drug. Behind her pink front door there hung a cardboard sign that listed a half-dozen varieties, with prices from $300 to $600 an ounce.

VMany cancer patients receive chemotherapy at the end of life, even if their kind of cancer is known to be unresponsive to the drugs, according to a study reported here today. The study, involving cancer patients who died in Massachusetts in 1996, found that a third of them received chemotherapy in the last six months of their lives. That finding ''strongly suggests overuse of chemotherapy at the end of life,'' said Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, the senior author.

THE TURANDOT PROJECT -- Just what it sounds like: a film about the making of a production of Puccini's opera. Zhang Yimou directed the opera, with its man-hating ancient Chinese princess, and Zubin Mehta was musical director. Allan Miller directed the film. The settings are Florence and Beijing. Aug. 10. WAYDOWNTOWN -- A comedy about the great Canadian indoors (offices, malls, food courts, parking garages). Some Calgary co-workers make a bet about who can go longest without actually going outside. With Fabrizio Filippo, Don Mckeller and Gordon Currie. Directed by Gary Burns. Aug. 10. AMERICAN OUTLAWS -- It's a western; it's an action comedy; it's about Jesse James and his gang. With Timothy Dalton, Colin Farrell and Scott Caan (son of James). Les Mayfield (''Flubber,'' ''Encino Man,'' ''2010'') directed. Aug. 17. CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN -- Nicolas Cage and Penlope Cruz in a World War II drama based on Louis de Bernires's novel about a smart and beautiful Greek villager and the Italian soldier, part of Mussolini's occupying army, who wins her heart. Directed by John Madden, whose last film was ''Shakespeare in Love.'' Aug. 17. RAW DEAL: A QUESTION OF CONSENT -- A sure-to-polarize documentary about a University of Florida rape case. Includes the fraternity brothers' sexually graphic home video. Directed by Billy Corben. Aug. 17. ROLLERBALL -- Chris Klein has the James Caan role and John McTiernan directs the remake of Norman Jewison's 1975 film about a sport that makes extreme football and wrestling look like badminton. Jean Reno is the evil team owner, who will do anything for ratings. Set in Kazakhstan in the very near future. Aug. 17. A related article is on page 3. FAMOUS -- From Griffin Dunne, a mock documentary about two would-be stars going through the routine -- casting calls, voice lessons, cosmetic surgery. Spike Lee and Carrie Fisher are among the cameos. Laura Kirk and Nat DeWolf are the stars. Aug. 22. JOHN CARPENTER'S GHOSTS OF MARS -- John Carpenter goes futuristic and extraterrestrial. In 2176, Natasha Henstridge and Ice Cube play cop and criminal on the Red Planet while Martians are taking over the bodies of Earth people who live there. Aug. 24. MAYBE BABY -- A romantic comedy about a couple trying to conceive and writing a movie about trying to conceive. Written and directed by Ben Elton (the British television series ''Blackadder''). Joely Richardson and Hugh Laurie and an impressive supporting cast, including Emma Thompson and Joanna Lumley. Aug. 24. O -- ''Othello'' goes to high school, and it's still a tragedy. Mekhi Phifer plays the title character, who rules the basketball court and loves beautiful Desi (Julia Stiles). But the green-eyed monster has hold of the coach's son (Josh Hartnett). Directed by Tim Blake Nelson. Aug. 24. -- PUNKS -- Four male friends -- one gay, one black, all single -- looking for love. A comedy written and directed by Patrik-Ian Polk. Rockmond Dunbar, Seth Gilliam and Vanessa Williams star. Aug. 24. SERENDIPITY -- John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale in a romance about a couple who meet, love, part and hope to be thrown together again by fate. Ten years later, fate needs a little prodding. Directed by Peter Chelsom, who did ''Town and Country.'' Aug. 24. SOUL SURVIVORS -- After surviving a car accident, a college freshman is visited by something from beyond the grave. With Melissa Sagemiller and Casey Affleck. Directed by Steve Carpenter, whose past work includes ''The Dorm That Dripped Blood.'' Aug. 24. SUMMER CATCH -- Rich girl loves poor baseball player on old Cape Cod. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jessica Biel star in a romantic comedy directed by Mike Tollin. Aug. 24. TOGETHER -- Members of a Swedish commune finally have to admit the 60's are over. It happens when the commune leader's sister moves in. Lisa Lindgren and Michael Nygvist in a comic drama written and directed by Lukas Moodysson. Aug. 24. VULGAR -- Now Kevin Smith's protg is making films. Bryan Johnson wrote, directed and stars with Brian O'Halloran in the comic story of a transvestite clown who makes it big. Aug. 24. ALL THAT GLITTERS -- Mariah Carey has appeared in a movie before, but this time she's the star. She plays -- right you are -- a young singer on ''the roller-coaster ride to superstardom.'' Directed by the actor Vondie Curtis-Hall, best known for ''Chicago Hope.'' Aug. 31. KNOCKAROUND GUYS -- Four New York mobsters' sons on their own in Montana. The cast includes John Malkovich, Dennis Hopper, Vin Diesel and Seth Green. A drama written and directed by Brian Koppelman and David Levien. Aug. 31.

Antonio Canales plays the proud patriarch mourning his daughter's death. Aug. 31. LES DESTINES -- From the Jacques Chardonne novel, an early-20th-century drama with real French star power. Emmanuelle Bart, Isabelle Huppert and Charles Berling star in the story of a minister, his marriage, his new love, two world wars and changing mores. Olivier Assayas directed. August. A MATTER OF TASTE (UNE AFFAIRE DE GOT) -- A young waiter is hired as a rich man's personal taster, but the job requires his all. A drama with Bernard Giraudeau and Jean-Pierre Lorit. Directed by Bernard Rapp. August. ON THE EDGE -- A drama about a young man in a mental hospital, the patient he befriends and the suicidal young woman he loves. Cillian Murphy stars; Stephen Rea plays his psychiatrist. Directed by John Carney. August. SADE -- Daniel Auteuil as the Marquis de Sade in a drama set a decade or so before ''Quills'' and in a much nicer prison. Directed by Benot Jacquot. August.

VSeveral promising leads have emerged in the police search for the two men who killed three people and wounded two on Thursday night in an apartment above the Carnegie Delicatessen in Midtown, officials said yesterday. Detectives were working on the theory that the two men, one of whom was called Sean, went to the four-room railroad flat at 854 Seventh Avenue intending to rob Jennifer Stahl, 39, an actress and singer who supported herself with a thriving business in high-grade marijuana, law enforcement officials said. But moments after the men walked into the apartment, one shot Ms. Stahl in the head, fatally wounding her.

VWebcam sites have provided Internet surfers with constant visual updates on subjects as diverse as the weather in Stockholm, marijuana sales at a cafe in Amsterdam and life in college dorm rooms. Businesses have generally shown little interest in the technology, but things are different down on the farm. Last year, the Grief family of Prairieburg, Iowa, was host to www.corncam.com on their farm, allowing tens of thousands of electronic visitors to follow the progress of a field of corn from planting through harvest. The project attracted sponsors (a farm magazine and the Garst Seed Company) and the family quickly began marketing corncam paraphernalia, including dried cobs labeled Souven-Ears.

VThe Supreme Court ruled today that federal law does not allow a ''medical necessity'' exception to the prohibition on the distribution of marijuana. The 8-to-0 decision dealt a setback, but not a definitive blow, to a movement that has passed medical marijuana ballot initiatives in eight states. The ruling did not overturn the state initiatives or address any question of state law. Rather, the court ruled that marijuana's listing by Congress as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act meant that it ''has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.''

VFor supporters of medical marijuana, today's unanimous United States Supreme Court ruling upholding a federal law banning the distribution of marijuana for any reason was a major blow, especially coming at a time when national polls show a growing acceptance of the drug for the sick and dying. But the ruling also made clear, advocates of marijuana for seriously ill patients said, that Congress could change the laws that ban the drug.

VSupporters of medical marijuana are bitter about unanimous United States Supreme Court ruling upholding federal law banning distribution of marijuana for any reason; note that decision bans private distribution clubs, but does not explicitly prevent states from distributing drug; resolve to encourage states to set up distribution systems for drug; Nevada and Maine have bills pending that would do so; in California, where current case originated, Atty Gen Bill Lockyer calls ruling unfortunate and says he needs to review it further before reaching any recommendation or conclusions about California's law; photos (M)

VIn May 1987, Dan Shapiro, then a 20-year-old junior at Vassar College, discovered he had Hodgkin's disease. After seven months of treatment with four chemotherapy drugs and radiation, he seemed healthy again. In 1988, in his first year of graduate school in clinical psychology, he counseled a young girl named Jodi who was not doing well after a bone marrow transplant for the same cancer and who soon died. Six months later, he learned that his own cancer had returned and that his only hope was a bone marrow transplant. His survival chances were 40 percent. Sixteen months after the transplant, in July 1991, he had a second relapse, and few options remained.

VA colleague recounting the circumstances of his father's recent death ultimately thanked the family doctor who had failed to diagnose the man's cancer. The doctor attended the funeral/ memorial service and, after expressing his profound regrets about the death, told the family that he'd been very distraught about the missed diagnosis and had gone back over the original X-rays to see what he'd missed. But, he said, even after knowing his patient had cancer, he still could not detect it on the film.

VThe federal government won a major legal victory Monday in its benighted efforts to prevent the use of marijuana to relieve the symptoms of pain, nausea or loss of appetite in desperately ill patients. But the Supreme Court's unanimous verdict against a California cooperative set up to supply marijuana to qualified patients need not terminate all efforts to help those who have no reasonable alternative treatment. The verdict simply shifts the onus to individual patients or to compassionate state governments to obtain marijuana for medical purposes and test the limits of federal intransigence. Although marijuana is categorized as an illegal drug under federal drug control laws, California and eight other states have passed laws that give patients the right to obtain it for medical purposes. Federal authorities, concerned that such state laws are a loophole allowing people to secure illegal drugs, sued for an injunction against the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative to shut down its operations as a violation of federal law. In its ruling against the cooperative, the court, which has often championed states' rights, found reason to ignore the wishes of Californians. The cooperative had the backing of the Oakland city government and police and was clearly consistent with the wishes of California voters, 56 percent of whom approved medical use of marijuana in a 1996 referendum.

Huish, 25, faced up to three years in prison if convicted of dealing drugs out of his home in California's Simi Valley. Huish made no comments to the court on Wednesday after entering his plea. He will be sentenced June 13. Huish's roommate and co-defendant, Brian Mastrangelo, 24, also appeared before Superior Court Judge Herbert Curtis and agreed to waive a jury trial. Curtis convicted Mastrangelo on three misdemeanor charges for allowing drug sales at the home and for possessing martial arts weapons.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-7 Suicide Bomber Kills 5; Israeli Jets Retaliate A Palestinian suicide bomber killed at least 5 Israelis and wounded more than 100 at a bustling shopping mall in the coastal town of Netanya. Israel retaliated by sending warplanes to strike targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the first time since the 1967 war, killing at least nine Palestinians. A sixth Israeli, an army officer, was killed in the West Bank. It was the deadliest day of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict this year. A1

VPolice officials in New York City, who spent years battling a crack scourge that sent the murder rate soaring, say they are now seeing increasing violence among dealers of marijuana, a drug that they say no longer fits its laid-back image. The level of violence still pales in comparison to the carnage of the turf wars between rival crack gangs a decade ago. But officials say they believe that the number of marijuana-related shootings has gone up in recent years and that investigators now routinely find guns, including submachine guns, when they execute search warrants at marijuana stash houses.

VIt is only when you get inside the British Parliament that you understand why it is called the ''Palace of Westminster.'' An enormous late-Victorian pile of pretension, it is built to look like some medieval cathedral rather than a modern Parliament. Giant pre-Raphaelite murals bear down on you; apparatchiks in white tie and tails ferry you about; stained-glass windows give the complex a funereal air. In the central meeting place, I wait under a huge bust of Gladstone, the towering figure of 19th-century English liberalism. And as if in some odd dream, I'm greeted by Sebastian Coe, the Olympic gold-medal-winning runner of the 1980's, and ushered through winding stairways and corridors into a guest seat on the floor of the Commons. Lord Coe, as he is now known, is private secretary for William Hague, the leader of the opposition. ''Where's your jacket?'' one of the officious Commons clerks yells at me as we cram onto a back bench. I sheepishly put it back on. And as Big Ben strikes 3, the little chamber -- not much bigger than a couple of tennis courts -- feels crammed. Only the yawns of the journalists in the gallery above us detract from the drama of it all.

VAndrew Sullivan article profiles William Hague, British Conservative Party, who is challenging Prime Min Tony Blair in June 7 election; polls predict something close to debacle for Hague, while British press has all but written him off and is openly speculating about who might succeed him; describes Hague as old-school political leader in sense that he is curiously immune to modern image-making, but also deeply modern representative of new breed of working- and middle-class politicians who are infiltrating ranks of formerly aristocratic Tory party; suggests that Hague will endure, but may need to suffer a genuine defeat before voters can see beyond his veneer of easy success to deeply able and humane man beneath; photos (M)

VWith the Supreme Court's 8-to-0 rejection of a ''medical necessity'' exception to federal drug laws, the government won a round in the battle over the medical use of marijuana. But the war is not over. The ruling, which involved a ''cannabis cooperative'' in Oakland, Calif., gave the government the right to close such large-scale distribution centers. Supporters of the grassroots movement to use marijuana to combat symptoms of cancer, AIDS and other conditions say they will carry on in other ways. Eight states have legalized its medical use, so a new federalism battle may be looming. Linda Greenhouse

VHere at the Foro Italico, site of the Italian Open, there is a stand that sells tennis memorabilia. Inside, on a top shelf, easy to miss because it is wedged between copies of an unauthorized Pete Sampras biography, is a relic from the early 1990's: a thin paperback with a pink cover titled ''Jennifer Capriati: Teenage Tennis Star.'' Capriati was only 16 when the book, written by Bill Gutman, was published. It was arguably too soon for a book, and it was definitely too soon for much of what was happening to Capriati at that stage: the worldwide celebrity; the wealth and the pressures that accompany large corporate sponsorship; and, above all, the gnawing sense of inadequacy she felt when she did not win the matches that she imagined, if perhaps a bit too intensely, she was expected to win.

However, if I developed cancer from cigarettes, I would not be allowed to smoke marijuana in order to treat side effects from chemotherapy, even with a doctor's recommendation. The legal substance could kill me; the substance with possible healing qualities is illegal.

VNew York police officials yesterday announced the arrest of a parolee in the killing of three people above the Carnegie Deli, saying that the parolee, a convicted felon, would not have been free to commit the crime but for an oversight by New Jersey parole authorities. The suspect, Andre S. Smith of Irvington, N.J., was charged as one of two men who barged into an apartment above the landmark Manhattan deli and shot five people, three fatally, during a robbery of a high-priced marijuana dealer on May 10.

VArnitra Johnson can imagine the rush of riding one of the roller coasters at Disney World. She has never been to any of the theme parks here, but she thinks the thrill must be the same as the high she used to get from marijuana and Ecstasy. ''Ecstasy, that's the talk of the town,'' said Ms. Johnson, an 18-year-old who lived until recently in the local Covenant House, a shelter for homeless youths. ''It makes you feel good, see different colors.''

VGerard Gravano's tattoo is large, but it is not terribly original. The image of the bull inked onto the right side of his stomach is a reference to his father, Salvatore, the Gambino family hit man better known as Sammy the Bull. Mr. Gravano, however, did not come up with the design himself. Federal drug agents said it was a perfect replica of the advertising logo for Merrill Lynch.

VTo the Editor: It is gratifying to have a distinguished writer treat ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' in such a positive fashion ['' 'Apocalypse' Then, and Now'' by David Thomson, May 13], but I feel compelled to correct a few misstatements. There was no falling out between George Lucas and myself over ''Apocalypse Now.'' I had financed it and owned the script, but George was busy with ''Star Wars'' and John Milius was also busy, and so it fell to me to direct the project. This was all worked out on a friendly basis; these are friendships that endure to this day.

VA law passed as a ballot initiative last November that allows certain patients to seek permission from the state to use small amounts of marijuana to relieve their discomfort has taken effect. Ken Salazar, the state attorney general who opposed the measure, said doctors who recommend marijuana for their patients still risked prosecution by the federal government because of a recent Supreme Court ruling that made marijuana clubs in California illegal. But proponents of the new law said the warning was a scare tactic to discourage doctors from helping their patients. Michael Janofsky (NYT)

VEven in retirement, the former Minnesota Vikings running back Robert Smith continues to make his quick moves. He is on the telephone, speaking to a member of the news media for the first time in months, and then, whoosh, he makes it clear he has no intention of returning to football. Then, whoosh, he sprints past a question about his plans. ''Basically, I'm not ready to talk yet about a lot of things,'' Smith said. ''When things kind of settle down, I'll have a lot to say. Just not now. I'm thinking about my future and trying to figure out which direction to go. Pretty much the only certainty is that I won't be coming back.''

VThe New Jersey Supreme Court ruled yesterday that the New Jersey Transit police illegally used race to stop and search a black man. The ruling turned on whether the man, Marlon A. Maryland, was legally stopped and searched when he was found with a bag of marijuana in 1995. He was sentenced in 1997 to five years in prison. Lower courts said the search was legal. But the state's highest court agreed with Mr. Maryland's lawyers. The court's ruling overturns Mr. Maryland's sentence, but it was not immediately clear whether he would receive a new trial or be freed. David M. Herszenhorn (NYT)

VTHE BOTANY OF DESIRE A Plant's-Eye View of the World By Michael Pollan 271 pages. Random House. $24.95. In an earlier book, Michael Pollan, who writes earnestly and cleverly about gardening, biology and the meaning of life, produced this marvelous epigram: ''Nature abhors a garden.'' It is marvelous because of its radish-like crispness and also because it so wittily pictures human beings as the masters of nature, often the sentimental lovers of nature, bollixed by nature's perversely blind drive toward disorder, at least in the garden.

VA court in the southwest city of Voronezh reduced to one year from 37 months the prison sentence of a 24-year-old American scholar, John Edward Tobin, who was convicted in April on marijuana-related charges. The court said Mr. Tobin would be sent to a prison camp in Mordovia, south of Moscow, within six days. Mr. Tobin, a Fulbright scholar who was studying at Voronezh State University, has said he was framed by the police; Russian officials have suggested that he may be granted a pardon should he request one.

VA week before the French Open, Jennifer Capriati was preparing for a workout on a tennis court in Monte Carlo, eager to hear the word ''Go.'' As she took her mark, she was also glad to have her brother, Steven, as company for the footwork drills designed to push lung capacity and create the choreography for a winning shot. But as the sprint work unfolded, the sturdy Steven Capriati, a tennis player at the University of Arizona, discovered the depth of his sister's endurance.

VA river of faces and banners, rippling. A tumult of salsa and sequined dancers. Delegations from Mayagez, Ponce and San Juan. White lapel ribbons to remember bombed Vieques. And everywhere the red, white and blue flags of Puerto Rico -- on T-shirts, sweatbands, head wraps, cheeks, even polished fingernails. It was the Puerto Rican Day Parade, in its 44th year one of New York City's largest events, and it swept up Fifth Avenue yesterday in a display of ethnic pride and surging political power that drew an estimated two million enthusiastic spectators and was watched over by 6,000 police officers.

VIn the early morning sunlight, the baseball tossed into the cloudless blue sky looked like a mini-moon that had lost its way. It went up and up, sailing well over the head of the intended receiver, a middle-aged coach with a catcher's mitt. The strong, loose-limbed young pitcher who had thrown the ball watched the flight with some dismay. It was not the first time he had seen a ball take off as though it contained a maddening inner spring. The young man and the coach were engaged in a casual long toss, separated by about 150 feet, in which a pitcher stretches his arm. They were alone last week on the outfield grass in a practice field of the St. Louis Cardinals' spring-training complex. As the ball landed near the center-field fence, the young pitcher, Rick Ankiel, shrugged and called, slightly sheepishly, to the retrieving coach, ''Too strong today.''

VIn an important declaration of the constitutional limits on new privacy-threatening technology, the Supreme Court ruled today that the use by the police of a thermal imaging device to detect patterns of heat coming from a private home is a search that requires a warrant. The court said further that the warrant requirement would apply not only to the relatively crude device at issue but also to any ''more sophisticated systems'' in use or in development that let the police gain knowledge that in the past would have been impossible without a physical entry into the home.

ssVabstract
p14376
VUS Supreme Court, in important declaration of constitutional limits on new privacy-threatening technology, rules use by police of thermal imaging device to detect patterns of heat coming from private home is search that requires warrant; overturns lower-court ruling in drug case, which held that 1999 warrantless use of device that revealed patterns of heat suggestive of marijuana-growing operation did not violate Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches; rules warrant requirement applies not only to relatively crude device at issue but also to any more sophisticated systems in use or in development that let police gain knowledge that in past would have been impossible without physical entry into home; 5-4 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia cuts across court's usual ideological division; dissenting opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, usually described as court's most liberal justice, backs lower-court decision on ground that police activity did not invade any constitutionally protected rights to privacy; says for court to make constitutional rule about future technology is unnecessary, unwise and inconsistent with Fourth Amendment; photo (M)

VLawyers for Juan Raul Garza, who is scheduled to be executed on Tuesday, filed a petition today with the Justice Department criticizing Attorney General John Ashcroft's conclusion in a study last week that federal death sentences have been imposed without racial or ethnic bias. The lawyers said that Mr. Garza, who is Mexican-American, should not be executed because of what they described as serious questions about the study. They said that the report relied on incomplete and misleading data to conclude that there was no evidence of racial bias even though only two of the 20 people on federal death row, after the execution Monday of Timothy J. McVeigh, are white.

V''The Fourth Amendment draws a firm line at the entrance to the house.'' So declared the Supreme Court on Monday in an important 5-to-4 ruling. The ruling reaffirmed the basic right of privacy that Americans are constitutionally entitled to enjoy in their own homes in an era when high-tech devices make it possible for police to snoop without any physical intrusion. The case concerns the use of a thermal imaging device by federal officers in Oregon who suspected that marijuana was being cultivated in a private home, using special, intense lighting. The government argued, and four dissenting justices agreed, that no warrant was needed because the infrared scan merely measured ''waste heat'' emitted from the exterior of the home, and that the images obtained were too murky to reveal ''intimate'' private information or disclose much about ''private activities'' in ''private areas'' of the house.

VEfforts to reach a deal to relax New York's drug sentencing laws have stalled, leaving some proponents worried that no revisions will be made this summer. In January, Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, threw his weight behind the idea of easing the laws, which mandate long prison sentences for drug felons, including many low-level street dealers and addicts. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, soon did the same. And advocates on both sides of the issue predicted that a consensus would be reached during the 2001 legislative session.

VIN the clash at the Supreme Court last week between old-fashioned personal privacy and newfangled law enforcement technology, few people predicted privacy would be the clear-cut winner. But it turned out that way when the court ruled that the police need a warrant to aim a thermal imaging device at the outside of a house to look for patterns of heat that could suggest indoor marijuana cultivation. The ruling is the latest of several decisions suggesting that this famously law-and-order court has begun to display a new skepticism toward the arguments that police and prosecutors bring before it. And the unanticipated shift is creating unusual alliances and unpredictable outcomes.

V''The question we confront today,'' wrote Justice Antonin Scalia in an opinion that places him up there with Louis (the right to be let alone) Brandeis, ''is what limits there are upon this power of technology to shrink the realm of guaranteed privacy.'' Cops in Oregon suspected a man of growing marijuana inside his house. They knew he would have to use high-intensity lamps, so they had this bright idea to place a thermal imaging machine across the street to measure the heat coming through his walls -- enabling them to ''see'' inside the house as if they had X-ray vision.

VWorking closely with Mexican authorities, federal officials have broken up a smuggling operation that shipped tens of millions of dollars worth of cocaine and marijuana from Colombia and Mexico into the United States, the government said today. Law enforcement officials in 16 American cities arrested 83 people suspected of taking part in the network, which had links to the Ciudad Jurez cartel in Mexico. That cartel was founded by the late drug kingpin Amado Carrillo-Fuentes and taken over by his brother, Vicente, after his death in 1997.

VGoedhuis Contemporary at Sotheby's New York 1334 York Avenue, at 72nd Street Through Thursday New York has had generous helpings of contemporary Chinese art in the last few years, particularly of work that shares features with recent conceptually based Western models. Less frequently seen in bulk is more conservative-looking work, usually painting, that balances Chinese formal traditions with Western modernism.

VThe director of an student exchange group was jailed on charges of marijuana use and possession, the security service said. Charles Daniel Perriello, director of the local office of the American Council for Collaboration in Education and Language Study, was arrested Thursday when he was caught using marijuana in his apartment. More was found during a search, security officials said. President Aleksandr Lukashenko has been critical of international groups in Belarus, which he accuses of plotting against his government. The American Embassy declined to comment.

VI have H.I.V. and use cannabis to alleviate nausea and lack of appetite. A friend grows and provides it at no cost. I distribute the remaining cannabis to 15 or so other people who either have H.I.V. or are undergoing chemotherapy. We all know this is illegal but feel that our lives come first. Are we not being ethical? -- Anonymous, Virginia I'm with you: what you are doing is illegal but not unethical. Society acknowledges a moral right to break the law in extreme circumstances each time a sitcom cop pulls over some hapless guy for speeding and asks, ''O.K., buddy, where's the fire?'' The implication: if the driver really is racing to extinguish a blaze, exceeding the speed limit is acceptable. Similarly, medical necessity can trump marijuana laws. While there are sound arguments for law-abiding behavior even when a law is ludicrous, in this situation you harm no one while relieving the suffering of the gravely ill who have no alternative remedy -- compelling reasons to violate the law. And you needn't worry that you are implicated in the occasional gunplay of the marijuana trade; that violence is a consequence of prohibition, not pharmacology, and in any case one would expect the not-for-profit, grow-your-own network of medical cannabis suppliers to be insulated from the excesses of the commercial trade.

VIt was finding an Israeli drug dealer dead in a car trunk at Los Angeles International Airport 18 months ago that gave the authorities here the first hint that the club drug Ecstasy was becoming a serious problem. He had been killed by two hit men from Israel, said Drug Enforcement Administration officials. Then there was the shipment of 2.1 million Ecstasy pills, worth $40 million on the street, that the United States Customs Service seized at the airport last July. The pills, labeled clothing, arrived on an Air France flight from Paris, intended for another Israeli dealer here. The authorities say it was the world's largest Ecstasy bust.

VLaw enforcement officials and drug experts warn that not only is use of Ecstasy exploding, more than doubling among 12th graders in last two years, but it is also spreading well beyond its origin as part drug for affluent white suburban teenagers to virtually every ethnic and class group, and from big cities like New York and Los Angeles to rural Vermont and South Dakota; at same time, huge profits to be made--a tablet that costs 50 cents to manufacture in underground labs in Netherlands can be sold for $25 in United States--have set off increasingly violent turf wars among Ecstasy dealers; chart shows who is using Ecstasy and where; photo (L)

VAn American student serving a one-year sentence in Russia on a drug conviction faced fresh difficulties today, after a Russian scientist accused the American of trying to recruit him as a spy for the United States. The scientist, Dmitri Kouznetsov, a toxicologist who was imprisoned in the United Statese three years ago on bad check charges, accused John Edward Tobin, 24, a Fulbright scholar convicted in April for possession of marijuana, of being an F.B.I. agent. Mr. Kouznetsov said that while he was jailed in the United States in 1998, Mr. Tobin visited him, identified himself as an F.B.I. agent and offered leniency if Mr. Kouznetsov would collaborate.

VMichael Pollan, a writer and gardener, might not consider himself a naturalist on the order of Henry David Thoreau, but he can spot a bug in the grass -- no mean feat to the eye of a visiting New Yorker, who couldn't have found a penny in the sun. ''Might be a firefly; I'll put it in a jar for Isaac,'' Mr. Pollan said, cupping the bug in his hand: a melon-striped, half-inch needle in a haystack.

VNO one would contend that Victor Toner had been a model student or a problem-free teenager. He smoked pot. He cut classes, talked back to teachers, boasted to fellow students. His decidedly less affluent crowd of friends, described by some of its own members as ''thugs,'' didn't fit in with the two largest segments at Moorestown High School -- the jocks and the preppies. His two-year relationship with his girlfriend was volatile, and his parents had announced plans to separate once he finished school. Yet Victor got respectable grades in classes when he made an effort, attended weekly Civil Air Patrol classes with plans to enlist in the Air Force after high school, helped build a recreation room for teenagers on the third floor of the municipal building, nursed a sick dog back to health, planted butterfly gardens with his father, and took on the toughest wing at the retirement home where he worked as a busboy, without complaint.

VFAMILIES with teenagers looking to test attitudinal fault lines (without imperiling health, safety or the family car) might profitably watch ''Crazy/Beautiful,'' which opened on Friday. The film falls squarely in the tradition of forbidden teenage romances, except this time the divide isn't drawn between warring families or races or classes, but values. Unlike all those movies in which the parents of the virginal girl try to save her from the good-at-heart outlaw boy, this time the girl's parents try to save the boy.

VThe final months of the Supreme Court term that ended last week brought a spate of unexpected decisions and unusual voting lineups. The decisions can best be understood against the backdrop of this term's most controversial decision, Bush v. Gore -- the decision that handed the presidency to George W. Bush. The heavy criticism of this ruling as an exercise in partisan politics seems to have stung the court. In reaction, several justices may have tried to save their legacy and prove their nonpartisanship by moderating their views -- which led to a term of unpredictable decisions.

VBy statute, and by roadside proclamation, the national forests, that vast empire of public lands that stretch across one-twelfth of the United States, are lands of ''many uses,'' including logging, ranching, hunting, skiing and camping. But time has stretched that definition to the limit. By virtue of their openness to one and all, the forests are more and more the home to the unusual, the criminal and the bizarre, with mushroom-gathering profiteers and methamphetamine makers among others competing with logging companies and recreationists for a share of the woods.

VIn the spring, the young actor who plays the dispirited adolescent son of a mob boss on ''The Sopranos'' saw the scriptwriters edge his character toward the path taken by his father, Tony Soprano. Vandalism and the theft of a geometry test got him expelled from high school, and the awkward youngster, slump-shouldered and slightly overweight, began suffering from panic attacks, like his gangster father. But early yesterday, according to the police, the 16-year-old actor, Robert Iler, got into more trouble than even the writers and producers of the HBO series had imagined. Not far from his apartment building on the Upper East Side, Mr. Iler was among four teenagers arrested after what the police called a strong-arm robbery. Mr. Iler and his friends took $40 by force from two 16-year-olds on a York Avenue street corner, the authorities said. When he was arrested a short while later, the police said, he had a bag of marijuana in his pocket, and a small bong, or water pipe. All four teenagers were charged with robbery.

VA narcotics detective working undercover in a tough Staten Island housing project was shot in the hand yesterday as he and a suspect grappled for his service revolver, the police said. The officer, Detective Victor Villareal, suffered severe damage to his left index finger, but was not expected to lose it, said doctors at St. Vincent's Staten Island Hospital. It was unclear how much function it would retain, they said.

VSometimes it's better not to take a second look. This seems to hold especially true for dresses, men and movies. Dazzling first impressions often fade on closer scrutiny. I was recently reminded of this upon revisiting ''Traffic,'' Steven Soderbergh's sprawling, jittery anti-drug film. It had been exciting to witness an increasingly rare phenomenon, a Hollywood picture with brains and energy and complexity -- even though its stern and moralistic anti-drug stance carried a whiff of ''Reefer Madness,'' the 1936 cinematic screed against marijuana, which became a cult film among dopers.

VCelebration and suffering are never far apart in the songs of Manu Chao, who played for a hugely overflowing crowd at Summerstage in Central Park on Saturday afternoon. As fans waved their arms and shouted along, Mr. Chao sang about marijuana, soccer, love and dancing. He also sang about nuclear war, the C.I.A. in Latin America, hiding from the police and slaughtering cattle exposed to mad cow disease. But as his band jumped into peppy ska or the pop-flamenco that the French call rhumba, the party never stopped. Mr. Chao was born in Paris to Spanish parents, and he has made a career of, and about, border hopping. He had hits in France and Spain as leading the band Mano Negra in the 1980's and 90's. His first album on his own, ''Clandestino'' (Ark 21) in 1998, was recorded primarily in informal settings on a low-tech eight-track machine; it has sold more than two million copies across Europe and South America. His new album, ''Prxima Estacin: Esperanza'' (Virgin), is a best seller in Europe.

VOne Michael, the son of an immigrant, is on a quest for self-discovery. Another Michael, an earl married to the daughter of a duke, knows exactly who he is. Ken is comfortable with his paunch, Iain is unbothered by his baldness and David is hoping to create a public persona. This ''Survivor''-style script line comes from the five-man contest for the leadership of the Conservative Party at a time when public image has overtaken ideological conviction as the determinant of who wins and who loses in Britain and when the press has enshrined celebrity as the principal front-page attraction.

They drank beer, sometimes more than one, and passed along tips on how to soothe arthritis while sharing neatly rolled marijuana joints.

VFor nearly 10 weeks on the run, Joseph Sean Salley kept a step ahead of one of New York City's biggest manhunts through a combination of odd jobs, scattered crimes and dumb luck, the authorities said. Mr. Salley, wanted in the execution-style killings of three people above the Carnegie Delicatessen in Manhattan on May 10, mowed the lawn at a cheap New Orleans hotel, worked as a short-order cook at the Miami Beach Convention Center, and, finally, held a construction job in Miami alongside some homeless men from a shelter where he hid for three weeks, according to the police.

VNOBODY can accuse George W. Bush and Tony Blair of neglecting the trans-Atlantic relationship. Mr. Blair was the first European leader to make an official visit to the newly elected Republican. Mr. Bush returned the compliment last week, dropping in on Mr. Blair's country residence. The two have discovered they have so many things in common they even use the same brand of toothpaste. Yet the two leaders seem to be trying too hard to erase doubts about their relationship. The obvious reason for such doubts is that they come from opposite sides of the political spectrum. Mr. Blair and Bill Clinton belonged to a series of trans-Atlantic fellow travelers that included Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, Harold Wilson and John F. Kennedy, and Harold Macmillan and Dwight D. Eisenhower. But Mr. Bush is no more inclined to chat about the ''third way'' than Mr. Blair is to wander around Texas in cowboy boots.

VDuring the spasm of violence in Jamaica earlier this month, my wife and I spent a quiet afternoon on the veranda at the home of my 84-year old mother, in a part of Kingston less than three miles from the center of the conflict that, over four days, left more than 25 people dead. We felt about as safe as we would anywhere in New York or Boston. Jamaica is a 144-mile mountain range jutting out of the Caribbean. The capital city of Kingston and the homes of most of the country's 2.5 million inhabitants are on the southern coast. Nearly all the hotels worth visiting are located a huge mountain and a social world away, on the northern coast. Jamaica does have a higher level of crime and violence than most other nations, but the violence is largely confined to particular urban neighborhoods in the southern part of the island. And the recent clash between police and politically motivated gangsters was restricted to one small section of the western urban slums of Kingston.

VDealing with the right coach in the right environment is all ERIC WYNALDA has wanted in his career. He has gone from college to Germany to the United States national team to four stops in Major League Soccer -- San Jose, Miami, New England and now Chicago. There has been a great deal of success along the way for Wynalda, the national team's career leading scorer (34 goals and 16 assists in 106 matches), but he seems to have found the perfect coach and the right environment in Chicago with the Fire. Playing for Coach BOB BRADLEY and playing with HRISTO STOITCHKOV of Bulgaria, who matches Wynalda's idiosyncrasies, the 31-year-old Wynalda is again scoring goals. Wynalda scored the winning goal with a minute left in sudden-death overtime on Saturday to give the Fire a 2-1 victory over the Dallas Burn.

VReviving moribund efforts to soften New York's Rockefeller-era drug laws, Gov. George E. Pataki is making a new offer, one that would give many more defendants the opportunity to undergo drug treatment rather than long prison terms. The new plan goes beyond what Mr. Pataki advocated in a bill he proposed earlier this year. The Democrats who control the Assembly had said the governor's earlier proposal did not go far enough, and countered with their own bill, which the governor dismissed as extreme. But there has been little substantive discussion between them, and critics of the drug laws had begun to fear that the issue was dead for the year.

VA 13-year-old girl has been arrested on drug-possession charges after bringing marijuana to summer school for show and tell. The girl, whose name was not released by the police because she is a minor, was arrested Friday after she brought a half-filled sandwich bag of the drug to show her classmates at Great Oaks Middle School, said Sgt. Paul Vance, a state police spokesman. School officials notified the police, who charged the girl with possession of marijuana.

VGov. George Pataki made a fresh offer this week to reform the draconian drug laws that have clogged New York State's prisons with more than 10,000 nonviolent drug users, many of them serving mandatory sentences for relatively minor offenses. The governor's latest proposal, a distinct improvement over the plan he issued in January, would allow thousands more defendants to undergo drug treatment rather than serve long prison terms. It should breathe new life into a flagging effort in Albany to revamp the unjust and unworkable Rockefeller drug laws enacted three decades ago. The governor's office has not yet drafted his new legislation, making it difficult to assess in detail. But as described by Mr. Pataki's aides, the revised plan would address one of the main flaws in his original bill, which was that it left out the largest group of drug defendants. The new plan would include treatment options for so-called class B felons charged with selling drugs, the category that includes most nonviolent addicts arrested in ''buy and bust'' operations. Such felonies now carry mandatory sentences as long as 25 years, but the governor would provide a chance at substantially reduced sentences through treatment.

VSeductive rhythm-and-blues smoothies worked a double shift in Manhattan on Sunday, when Craig David sang at the afternoon show at Summerstage and then R. Kelly finished a two-night stand at the Theater at Madison Square Garden. Each advertised his sexual prowess and promised to fulfill a woman's every need, slowly and thoroughly. The 20-year-old Mr. David, a million-selling hit maker in Europe who has just released his debut album, ''Born to Do It'' (Wildstar/Atlantic), in the United States, came across as an ingratiating younger English version of Mr. Kelly -- so much so that each man sang Mr. Kelly's ''Did You Ever Think,'' a humbly self-congratulatory tribute to the singer's own wealth and success. They sang with wiry tenor voices, moaning in serpentine Stevie Wonder phrases.

Tobin, 24, of Ridgefield, Conn., the Fulbright scholar sentenced in April to serve 37 months on marijuana charges, may find his term reduced for good behavior and could soon be released from a prison camp south of here, a regional spokesman for the Justice Ministry said today. After nearly six months in jails, Mr. Tobin is learning woodworking and attends Orthodox Christian services, the spokesman said. He added that prison officials would probably upgrade Mr. Tobin's living conditions and that a local court could order his early release if the prison requested it.

Mr. Qu, a Chinese citizen, was sentenced on Tuesday to 13 years in prison in the spying case, charged with providing photocopies of speeches and magazine articles deemed state secrets to Gao Zhan, the American-based scholar who was reunited with her family in the United States today. Few people expect that the appeal he is reportedly preparing will win him his freedom.

But you will hear quite the opposite lament from Britain's Conservatives as they contemplate this summer's election of a new leader. The two men running -- Kenneth Clarke and Iain Duncan Smith -- could not be more of a contrast, and by the time the winner is announced on Sept. 12, the Tories may be sorry theirs was not a boring Tweedledum-and-Tweedledee contest like some others.

VJoseph Sean Salley, a suspect in a triple slaying above the Carnegie Deli in Midtown who was apprehended in Florida earlier this month, has decided not to fight his return to New York, the authorities said. Mr. Salley, 29, who was arrested in Miami on July 15 after eluding the authorities for nearly 10 weeks, had told a judge there last week that he would fight extradition proceedings. But he told law enforcement officials on Thursday that he had changed his mind. His return is expected sometime next week.

VPaula is taking me on a driving tour of Man, the tiny West Virginia town where she has spent her entire life. Because I don't know my way around the hollows and gullies and creeks that carve through these hills, Paula is at the wheel. And because Paula isn't a morning person, we've set out on our tour at midnight. It's dark; the only illumination comes from our headlights cutting through the mist that rolls down from the hills. The tour Paula is leading isn't sanctioned by the local chamber of commerce; there are no stops at Civil War plaques or scenic vistas. It's a pillhead tour: an addict's-eye view of the radical changes that a single prescription drug, called OxyContin, has brought to the town of Man. OxyContin abuse started in remote communities like this one more than two years ago; more recently, it has spread beyond its origins in Appalachia and rural Maine to affect cities and suburbs across the eastern United States. I came to Man to try to understand how America's latest drug problem started, to see its roots and trace how it has spread.

VTHE face, according to an old Latin tag, is the index of the soul. If that is true, then Louis Armstrong must have been the happiest of men, for everyone who met him was promptly and permanently disarmed by the warmth of his yard-wide smile; he was born a century ago this Saturday, and in all that time he appears to have made no enemies. The feeling was not necessarily mutual, though; Benny Goodman once made the mistake of high-hatting him at the start of a joint concert tour and was soon reduced to feigning a heart attack to escape the trumpeter's wrath. Nor did Armstrong hesitate to speak his mind, loudly and publicly, whenever he thought it appropriate. In the most celebrated of his outbursts, triggered by Dwight Eisenhower's initial unwillingness to force Gov. Orval Faubus of Arkansas to desegregate the public schools of Little Rock, he informed an astonished reporter that the President of the United States had ''no guts'' and that ''the government can go to hell.'' Popular entertainers, especially black ones, didn't make a habit of saying things like that in 1957.

I'm not talking about commercial flight, which is drab, but of taking to the air to rescue people from peril or keep democracy safe. Of course, there's a problem.

VJohn Tobin, a Fulbright scholar, will get a parole recommendation from the warden of the Russian prison where he is being held on drug charges, a congressman said yesterday. The congressman, Representative James Maloney, who represents Mr. Tobin's home town of Ridgefield, said that his office had received an e-mail message from the United States Embassy in Moscow late Friday saying that the warden would recommend Mr. Tobin's early release for good behavior. Mr. Tobin, 24, is at the halfway point of his one-year sentence for marijuana possession. During talks with President Vladimir Putin in June, President Bush said that the scholar should be released.

VTHIRTY summers ago, I suffered heat exhaustion while practicing high school football in Louisiana and came home ashen-skinned, needing help to walk, unable to eat or even to drink a full glass of water. Fourteen hours later, I was back at two-a-days. I was a senior, the starting center and middle linebacker, and had already missed most of spring practice with a dislocated shoulder. Football's macho code said, ''Suck it up.''

Several men in long dreadlocks were waving the movement's familiar green-yellow-red flags, an old man in a white robe was reciting biblical verses, another was sucking lustily on a footlong pipe that had transformed his nostrils into two hyperactive chimneys. The strong, strong whiff of marijuana hung in the air, making everybody oblivious to the chilly morning.

VJohn E. Tobin Jr., the jailed American Fulbright scholar, walked out of a southwest Russian prison today a free man, paroled hours earlier on a minor marijuana conviction that briefly threatened to blossom into an international espionage drama. A district court in the small town of Rossosh, near the Ukrainian border, ordered Mr. Tobin released this morning at the urging of officials at the prison camp there, who described him as an exemplary inmate. He had served roughly six months of a 37-month sentence -- later reduced to one year -- for possessing less than two-tenths of an ounce of marijuana and sharing it with others. The police said they found marijuana in his clothes and in his apartment after they seized him outside a nightclub in Voronezh, 280 miles south of Moscow.

VHe has been an image on a surveillance camera, a suspect, a fugitive, then a prisoner in Florida's custody. And yesterday, Joseph Sean Salley, 29, became a New York defendant arraigned in Manhattan on charges that he killed three people and wounded two others in an apartment above the Carnegie Deli during a bungled robbery on May 10. He also became a more concrete object of hatred for one of the victims' fathers, Philip King, who has repeatedly urged prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Mr. Salley and the man said to be his accomplice, Andre S. Smith, 31. Yesterday, Mr. King flew in from California to watch the arraignment in State Supreme Court and repeat his message. The two men are each charged with three counts of second-degree murder, which is not a capital crime. If other family members of the victims were in court, they did not put themselves before the cameras, so Mr. King, 60, stood alone on the steps of the courthouse, talking of vengeance for the death of his son, Stephen King, 32.

VHe has not yet seen the glamour of life in the National Football League -- the big money, the fancy cars -- and chances are he never will. Tevita Ofahengaue was selected in the seventh and final round of the draft last spring; he is a rookie on the bottom rung of professional football, and his life, like those of dozens of other seventh-round selections across the league, is about as glamorous as a church picnic. Ofahengaue's team, the Arizona Cardinals, recently gave him a $30 per diem for food. He has a wife and four young children back home in Tempe, Ariz., and he did not bring much cash with him to training camp in northern Arizona, having left most of it at home for his family. So when some Cardinals veterans leaped into their luxury sedans and S.U.V.'s to meet for dinner at a steak house the other night, he ate pizza in the team cafeteria, unable to afford an evening out.

VArticle in series By A Thread: The Final Pick, which focuses on NFL players selected in final round of draft, provides glimpse of gritty side of football where high salaries and luxury cars are only dreams; players chosen in seventh, or final, round of draft represent football's underclass; they endure grueling training camps and will probably be released before season begins; article profiles Tevita Ofahengaue, selected by Arizona Cardinals, and like other seventh-rounders, his chances of making team are slim and opportunities to even get on field and let coaches see him in action are few; photos (M)

VThe father of the Fulbright scholar John E. Tobin Jr. was reunited yesterday with his son, who had been jailed since January on drug charges in Russia. Mr. Tobin, a Ridgefield resident who was released Friday on parole from a prison in southern Russia, remained in Moscow to get an exit visa. ''He sounded very good,'' John Tobin Sr. said after meeting with his son in Moscow. ''He's very happy to be out.'' John E. Tobin Jr., 24, was arrested in Voronezh, where he was studying at the local university. The police said that he had a small amount of marijuana in his possession and that more was found at his apartment.

VJohn E. Tobin Jr., the American Fulbright scholar who was accused of being a spy and jailed in Russia for six months on charges of marijuana possession, returned to the United States yesterday accompanied by his father, John E. Tobin Sr., and Representative James H. Maloney of Connecticut, who had lobbied tirelessly for his release. Mr. Tobin Jr., 24, looking gaunt and tired, landed at Kennedy International Airport after a 10-hour flight from Moscow. At a news conference at the airport, he said, ''It's great to be back in the land of the free and it's great to be back in a country where basic human rights are respected and the due process of law is also a respected institution.''

VThe other day, my brother brought me part of his new crop of Valencia oranges. He lives in an orange grove at the edge of the city, where he raises them, along with fighting roosters. For money, he takes his chain saw to dead citrus and loads his truck with firewood. He lived with me years ago. When my husband and I bought a 1910 Craftsman bungalow, we faced major repairs, and my brother, then 25 and a house painter, said he would trade work for lodging. On this dead-end street lined with cottages, my brother scared our elderly neighbors right away, setting up scaffolds while sing-shouting to AC/DC.

VFor anyone who lived in Russia during the height of the cold war, the experience of John E. Tobin Jr., the American Fulbright scholar, may resonate. When Mr. Tobin, accused of being a spy and jailed in Russia for six months on charges of marijuana possession, returned to the United States last week, he denied the accusations. In an e-mail message to officials of the Fulbright program, he also told of something that struck a chord with me -- efforts by Russian intelligence officials to recruit him as a spy. In 1955, I was also approached about being a spy -- not in prison, but in the lobby of the Bolshoi Theater during an intermission of the ballet ''Giselle.'' A Russian claiming to be a journalist told me he wanted to exchange views. A few days later he called on me in my room at the National Hotel. Feigning concern about hidden microphones, he turned my shortwave radio to full volume and, whispering in my ear, launched into an account of a Soviet naval accident in the Black Sea that he said had resulted in many casualties. Clearly, he was trying to induce me to write a story on a subject that could bring charges of espionage against an American journalist -- particularly if true. I listened but took no notes to avoid any evidence of complicity.

Mr. Green said yesterday that his campaign would mail CD-ROM's, presenting the core of his campaign, to 10,000 voters culled from lists of registered voters. The disc features his mini-manifesto, ''Toward a Smarter City -- 100 Ideas for a New York Century,'' and offers links to his issue papers, policy speeches and Web site. The disc begins with an image of Mr. Green, the city's public advocate, who tells viewers that he is ''so excited to welcome you to my CD-ROM.''

VThe medical examiner of Spokane County resigned after state and federal drug agents found several marijuana plants and a large volume of prescription drugs in his home. The examiner, Dr. George Lindholm, was not immediately arrested, and officials would not say whether he would face charges. ''It's a situation related to depression, a divorce and a bad choice,'' Dr. Lindholm told The Spokane Spokesman-Review. He said he had smoked marijuana occasionally and had started growing the plants ''out of curiosity'' this summer. Sam Howe Verhovek (NYT)

VIn retrospect, John E. Tobin Jr. is not quite sure exactly when his life turned into the stuff of spy movies. But in an interview tonight, Mr. Tobin, the 24-year-old Fulbright student who was accused of espionage and jailed in Russia for six months on marijuana charges, recalled a particularly cinematic moment shortly after his arrest. ''This gentleman walks in with a big folder, a page on top, and starts reading it,'' Mr. Tobin said. ''And he runs this interrogation technique, you know, they know everything about you. I saw it and recognized it from the movie 'The Matrix.' They do the same thing when they bring in Keanu Reeves, who, by the way, the ambassador suggested as the lead role for my movie, actually.''

VIN retrospect, John Edward Tobin Jr. said the warning signs were there. A strange car he had never seen before ''all of a sudden'' was parked outside his apartment in Russia for weeks. New acquaintances invited themselves over with increased frequency. Even the night the Fulbright scholar was arrested on drug charges outside a nightclub in Voronezh was a little unusual. People he had just met invited him to a ''very nice establishment'' and gave him complimentary tickets to a ''very expensive club.''

VDear Thermostat This summer nearly 2,000 Long Islanders added someone new to their online buddy lists: their thermostats. Under a free program set up by the Long Island Power Authority (www.lipaedge.com), homeowners with central air conditioning can adjust the temperatures in their homes by visiting a page at the power company's site. The utility replaced those customers' thermostats with digital ones from Carrier equipped with a satellite connection. The power authority said that with this added flexibility, homeowners could reduce energy costs by 10 to 15 percent over the summer. But customers are not the only ones who can log in to change the temperature: during the summer, the power authority can, too, although only from 2 to 6 p.m. on a maximum of seven days between June 1 and Sept. 30.

VA Washington County drug task force has harvested almost 3,000 marijuana plants in the last week as part of its annual late-summer eradication campaign. Aided by an Army helicopter, the police and sheriff's deputies destroyed marijuana plants on six properties in Cambridge, about 35 miles northeast of Albany. Officers in the helicopter spotted two girls, ages 15 and 16, pulling up marijuana plants, said Police Chief George Bell. The girls face misdemeanor drug charges.

VAfter running from the law for more than nine years, a Westchester County man was arrested last week and charged with being one of the biggest wholesale marijuana suppliers in the New York area over the last two decades. Irwin S. Kletter, originally from Bedford, was picked up Aug. 16 at his home in Pompano Beach, Fla., federal officials announced yesterday. He was arraigned yesterday on charges of running a drug operation that had moved in excess of 1,000 kilograms of marijuana since 1990, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, the officials said. He is being held without bail.

VLAST season, ''The Producers'' marched the Broadway musical resolutely backward in time. The shtick, the ''girls'' (both young and old), the tunes, the governing taste, were all determinedly old-school. Audiences loved it. So did the critics. As the screenwriter and longtime theatrical observer William Goldman put it in Variety: ''Come back to the theater. All is forgiven.'' Yet there was something even more noteworthy than the show's retro aesthetic: ''The Producers'' injected a powerful dose of the values and entertainment style of contemporary popular culture into Broadway's static, isolationist environs.

VThomas Henry Huxley designated three men as the finest intellects of 19th century natural history: his dear friend Charles Darwin; his most worthy opponent Georges Cuvier; and Karl Ernst von Baer, who discovered the mammalian egg cell in 1827 and wrote the founding treatise of modern embryology in 1828. Of these three, posterity has largely forgotten von Baer, who suffered a severe mental breakdown in the 1830's, but then recovered and moved to Russia (not uncommon for a German-speaking Estonian national), where he enjoyed a distinguished second university career, largely in anthropology and lasting well into the 1870's. In 1828, von Baer enunciated the central principle of embryological development, later known as ''von Baer's law'' and now regarded as the correct interpretation of Ernst Haeckel's famous (and erroneous) claim that ''ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,'' or that the successive forms of embryology repeat the adult stages of a lineage's evolution -- with the gill slits of an early human embryo representing an ancestral fish and the later tail an ancestral reptile, for example.

Mr. Iler, a 16-year-old actor on the cable television drama ''The Sopranos,'' cursed at OFFICER MICHAEL FOLEY about an hour after he was taken into custody on July 4, papers filed by prosecutors say. They also say that Mr. Iler bragged, ''Don't you worry about me -- I'm a millionaire.''

VWith a reasonable assurance that Weaverville the only town of any real size in the only county in California without a single stoplight -- was not going to burn to the ground, people here today got back to debating one force of nature that seems to defy human manipulation -- wildfire. Like other Western towns built in places of great beauty and hot-breathed summers, Weaverville knows fire like a rodeo hand knows mustangs; but the beast is seldom corralled.

V'Controlled' Blaze That Wasn't Haunts Firefighters in California

ssVabstract
p21574
VWestern towns debate how to control wildfires--force of nature that seems to defy human manipulation; record 8.4 million acres burned nationwide last year; everybody agrees that years of aggressive fire-fighting have left woods full of dry undergrowth that do not need much to burn; what is vexing is deciding what to do about problem; debate over how to reduce risk of wildfires is haunted by 1999 event, when fire set by government as preventive measure blew out of control; Interior Sec Gale A Norton agrees that century of fire containment has led to present predicament; because most wildfires happen close to homes, basic strategy continues; in Weaverville, fire that may have started with mere spark from car has destroyed nearly dozen homes and forced one-day evacuation of half the town; photos; diagram (M)

VA statue of Harry Truman that was sawed off at the ankles here during the American intervention in Kosovo still has not been restored -- and may not be. ''We don't know what he looked like,'' Americans pressing for repairs were told. Such anti-American feeling remains palpable here, nearly 30 years after the demise of an American-supported military dictatorship. But there is one sign that this may be finally changing: The most popular politician in the country today is American born, Amherst-educated and surrounded by a coterie of Greek-American advisers, some of whom speak English only. In his off-hours, he's a gym rat in a culture that does not embrace sweat; he caused a stir in a downtown health club recently just by showing up.

VA former low-level security analyst with the F.B.I.'s Las Vegas office admitted today that he stole agency records that were later sold to mob figures, criminal defendants, lawyers and the targets of grand jury investigations in New York and elsewhere. Less than three months after his arrest, the analayst, James J. Hill, pleaded guilty in Federal District Court to four separate counts: conspiracy to steal Federal Bureau of Investigation records, theft of records, conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice, said Stephen C. King, an assistant United States attorney.

VOn the first day of the new school year, students descending on Horace Greeley High School today had an unlikely escort: television news trucks. The police had announced that the parents of a high school senior faced criminal charges stemming from a weekend party at their home where they watched as a stripper performed for their teen-age son and several classmates, with some participating in a lewd act. ''It's stupid, egregious behavior,'' said James F. Donovan, the schools superintendent, who is starting his first year in a district that is home to bankers, lawyers, a former president and a current senator. ''How could you possibly permit that to go on?''

V''God doesn't exist,'' scoffs Fernando (Germn Jaramillo), the middle-aged lapsed-Catholic protagonist of ''Our Lady of the Assassins,'' Barbet Schroeder's indelible, blood-dripping portrait of the Colombian city of Medelln. A fiftysomething homosexual writer who has returned to the city of his youth after 30 years abroad, Fernando sardonically describes himself as his country's ''foremost grammarian.'' He has returned there to die, he explains with a self-deprecating nonchalance that conceals an underlying grandiosity. For all of Fernando's protestations of world-weariness, the speed with which he falls in love with aimless young men, along with his passion for Maria Callas (who is heard singing an aria from ''The Barber of Seville''), suggests that beneath his ostentatious ennui and writer's block he still has a healthy appetite for life. As he rediscovers the city of his childhood, he surrenders to a giddy mixture of lust and disgust that he fools himself into imagining is a nihilistic comfort zone immune to tragedy.

The student, Alexander Eugene Klochkoff, was found lying on a beanbag chair on the porch of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house with no pulse and some blood on his nose on Wednesday morning. That noon, his father drove to Maryland to gather hospital reports and speak to campus officials, his son's fraternity brothers and police detectives.

VThe National Football League has added the stimulant ephedra, used by dozens and perhaps hundreds of its players, to its list of banned substances, making the N.F.L. the first major professional sports league to ban the drug. Ephedra has been blamed for the deaths of some high school and college athletes, and the Food and Drug Administration says reports of illness from supplements including ephedra have nearly doubled in recent years, reaching 407 in 1999.

With a rousing score by Mark Hollmann that pays fond tribute to Kurt Weill, a book by Greg Kotis that giddily takes on the weird Broadway tradition of expressing social outrage in song and dance, and choreography by John Carrafa that sends up his predecessors from Michael Kidd to Michael Bennett, the surprise off-Broadway hit from last spring is as much about show business as the innate human right to void one's bladder for free. Now it comes to Broadway. Directed by John Rando. With John Cullum, Nancy Opel, Jeff McCarthy and Spencer Kayden. Henry Miller, 124 West 43rd Street. In previews. Opens Thursday.

With Peter Bartlett, Harriet Harris and Neal Huff. Greenwich House Theater, 27 Barrow Street. In previews. Opens Sept. 20.

(212-246-4422) www.secondstagetheatre.com ''THE SHAPE OF THINGS'' A transfer production from the Almeida Theater in London, where it was a buzzy hit, this is a show that has hip and hot ticket written all over it.

Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway. (212-580-1313). Previews begin Sept. 20. Opens Oct. 10. * ''THOU SHALT NOT'' With direction and choreography by Susan Stroman, the show has the advantage of a royal imprimatur and the disadvantage of high expectations.

The story, set in New Orleans after World War II, is an adaptation of ''Thrse Raquin,'' Zola's play about adultery and murder. The book is by David Thompson (''Steel Pier'').

VThe first reports were of a doomed flight salvaged at the last moment by quick thinking and heroism. But by now, the story of how a Canadian jet crossing the Atlantic survived disaster has changed into a tangle of missteps. For the 304 people on Air Transat Flight 236 last month, a hard landing in the Azores provided a moment of miraculous relief. With neither of its engines working, the stricken plane glided safely -- if in terrifying silence -- almost a hundred miles, and landed without serious injuries.

VSafe emergency landing in Azores by Air Transat jetliner after losing both engines to fuel leak during trans-Altanic flight has changed from story of heroism on part of crew to tangle of missteps; pilot Robert Piche, co-pilot Dirk DeJager and carrier are under investigation about decisions made before and during emergency; major question is whether captain magnified crisis by transferring fuel from working engine to failing engine, not realizing it was leaking; travel agents report cancellations of Air Transat bookings or refusals to fly on its planes; class-action lawsuit charging maintenance lapses has been filed on behalf of 304 passengers; Canadian government has fined it about $160,000 for maintenance violations and restricted over-water flights; some misgivings are surfacing about safety of trans-Atlantic crossings by two-engine aircraft, though industry insists two engines are all but failproof; plane, Airbus A330-200 with two Rolls-Royce engines, was on overnight flight from Toronto to Lisbon on Aug 23-24 at time of mishap and had to glide nearly 100 miles before landing without serious injuries; photo (M)

He was depressed, given to fits of uncontrollable rage, and seemed to have no idea how to make friends. ''His peer group doesn't want anything to do with him,'' said his father, a 53-year-old dentist. ''His social skills are horrible.

p22455
ssVabstract
p22456
VSpecial schools and programs for troubled teenagers have become multibillion-dollar industry that has surged in last 10 years to satisfy what many say is booming market in parental desperation; parents unable to handle rebellious children on their own have more avenues of outside help than ever; options include therapeutic boarding schools, 'emotional growth' schools, residential treatment schools, rural farms and desert boot camps, many imposing strict military or religious discipline; some programs promise help for specific problems, some are as well established as prep schools, while others are small and informal as a teacher's home; one thing they have in common is cost: usually thousands of dollars a month; experts say growth of industry reflects changes in larger culture that make raising children harder than ever; families are splintered and influences of media and technology on children are pervasive; experts say in society marked by affluence and overwork, where therapy is routine, desperate parents will naturally be inclined to seek outside help for both minor and severe problems; photos (M)

V''I don't regret setting bombs,'' Bill Ayers said. ''I feel we didn't do enough.'' Mr. Ayers, who spent the 1970's as a fugitive in the Weather Underground, was sitting in the kitchen of his big turn-of-the-19th-century stone house in the Hyde Park district of Chicago. The long curly locks in his Wanted poster are shorn, though he wears earrings. He still has tattooed on his neck the rainbow-and-lightning Weathermen logo that appeared on letters taking responsibility for bombings. And he still has the ebullient, ingratiating manner, the apparently intense interest in other people, that made him a charismatic figure in the radical student movement. Now he has written a book, ''Fugitive Days'' (Beacon Press, September). Mr. Ayers, who is 56, calls it a memoir, somewhat coyly perhaps, since he also says some of it is fiction. He writes that he participated in the bombings of New York City Police Headquarters in 1970, of the Capitol building in 1971, the Pentagon in 1972. But Mr. Ayers also seems to want to have it both ways, taking responsibility for daring acts in his youth, then deflecting it.

VUSUALLY the well known are lured into designer shops, not asked to leave. But it was under those unusual circumstances that the tousle-haired comedian Andy Dick found himself on the sidewalk outside the Paul Smith shop on lower Fifth Avenue in the glaring afternoon sun the Friday before last. ''I guess that means they're not going to give me the suit for free,'' Mr. Dick said with a shrug. His entourage -- stylist, manager, publicists and 21-year-old girlfriend -- just rolled their eyes. Clearly, this was a repeat episode for all who know Mr. Dick, 35, the writer, producer and star of MTV's semi-annoying comedy sketch ''The Andy Dick Show.'' He had made a nuisance of himself again, breached the etiquette of shopping in an upscale boutique and been shown the door.

VLAST week, the media frenzy around Chappaqua and its teenage stripper party moved on to actual life-and-death issues, as attention turned to the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. The news vans left Horace Greeley High School, fulfilling the wishes of residents here who, for a week, had been telling reporters to go cover some ''real news.'' But though the school may be out of the tabloid headlines, the media blitz over a football team party that featured a stripper named Nicole has left behind an unsettled community agonizing over issues of privilege, morality and parental irresponsibility.

VMuggles of the world, unite,'' a Variety review begins, invoking a 1997 noun from J.K. Rowling's magical novels about a boy wizard named Harry Potter. While younger readers already know their Potterese, parents and those less fluent may welcome some lexical help. Muggles, for example, is a word that Rowling says she invented for ''nonmagical humans.'' It may derive from mug, a 1708 term for ''face'' drawn from drinking cups decorated with grotesque visages, but the Potter word is not without controversy. Nancy Stouffer, another author of children's books, lays earlier claim to the same word in her 1984 book, ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles.'' According to the O.E.D., that noun is actually much older, dating back to Middle English. There's even a 1928 Louis Armstrong recording titled ''Muggles,'' from another modern sense of the word: ''cigarettes laced with marijuana.'' (Readers of J.R.R. Tolkien may be equally distressed that hobbit began as a 1729 word for ''howitzer.'')

But now the so-called Triple Frontier suddenly confronts a much bigger problem: 40 F.B.I. agents and police officers from three other countries are scouring the area for evidence that the region has become a haven for Islamic terrorists. ''This is the very last thing that we needed here,'' lamented Faoud Fakih, a department store owner and prominent member of the Arab community here. ''Business is already bad, and now we are going to be stained by an even more disastrous kind of propaganda?''

VMaurice Greene and Michael Johnson, two of the world's fastest men, faced each other in an eagerly awaited 200-meter race at the United States Olympic trials in July 2000. But neither Olympic medalist won the race that day; victory went instead to an athlete named John Capel, a sprinter and football player from Brooksville, Fla., with thighs of steel and a knack for trouble. Many people noticed Capel's talent for the first time that day. Some National Football League teams began drooling over his speed, with several contemplating picking him in the middle rounds, or perhaps higher, in the annual draft.

VAlong Luke Lane, a narrow, cluttered side street nestled in one of West Kingston's busy markets, the smell from glistening heaps of red snapper quickly gives way to another more pungent aroma. On barrels, footstools and tables lie piles of thick, bushy buds of marijuana, eagerly trumpeted by vendors who puff away all day. ''People have nothing, so they plant ganja,'' said one young man, who declined to give his name but whose family grows marijuana in the countryside and sells it here for as little as $2 for a stem with a few thick buds. ''If the police come by and mash it up, they will plant again the next day. And if the police come and take the herb here, we'll be out selling again the next day.''

VThe terrorist attacks so unnerved Phil Preston, a senior vice president for the Comforce Corporation, that one week after they occurred he ordered criminal background checks on all information technology employees with jobs in Internet security and networking-systems support. Until then, Comforce, a staffing agency in Woodbury, N.Y., had conducted such investigations only if a client requested them. After all, the company had an amorphous, ever-shifting work force of about 8,500 people whom it contracted out to thousands of companies. And it hired as many as 500 people a week when demand for its services shot up.

VThis month, Chicago Bears fullback Daimon Shelton was notified by the National Football League that he had violated the league's steroid policy. According to Bears officials and some teammates, Shelton is asserting that the test was faulty. He has appealed the positive result, those officials and players said, and the appeals process could take weeks. Meanwhile, under N.F.L. rules Shelton is allowed to continue playing. But since the league has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to anabolic steroids, if Shelton's appeal is rejected by the commissioner's office, he would face a four-game suspension even if this were his first offense.

VAccording to recent reports, irony is finished in American pop culture. Then again, even more recent reports suggest that irony has already managed a furtive comeback. There is yet further evidence, however, to be found at the Variety Arts Theater, that at least one extreme form of the ironic arts -- its flashiest and silliest incarnation, known as camp -- is indeed ready for last rites. This latest source of speculation on the fate of arch exaggeration and talking in quotation marks is an industriously ineffective musical, ''Reefer Madness.'' It officially -- and, if you must, ironically -- opened last night in Greenwich Village, the neighborhood where theatrical camp came to flower most lavishly.

VThe police in Galveston, Tex., are trying to determine whether a suspect charged with murdering and dismembering a 71-year-old man there is a member of the wealthy and influential Durst real estate family in New York, the authorities said. A man identified as Robert A. Durst, 58, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with the killing. He was freed yesterday after posting bond with money wired from New York, said Kurt Sistrunk, Galveston County's first assistant district attorney.

Aversano Jr. liked to take care of everybody and everything. Especially his fish. At his home in Manalapan, N.J., Mr. Aversano, 58, kept a suburban-sized aquarium with five fish that he doted on. ''Those were his babies,'' said Lisa Aversano, Mr. Aversano's youngest daughter. ''He would sneak in to see them early in the morning, and he would talk to them as if they were people. He would say, 'Hi fishies, good morning. Your sister is here to visit. Be nice to her. You guys look so nice today.' ''

VA selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show. + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights. ++ means discounted tickets were available at the TKTS booth for last Friday night only. Broadway * ''DANCE OF DEATH.'' As the infirm army captain living in spiteful and isolated wedlock in Strindberg's poisoned portrait of a marriage, Ian McKellen brings something frightening and majestic to the act of putting one wayward foot before the other. He projects aggressive arrogance that doesn't so much conquer decay as ignore it. Every willed gesture, no matter how sloppy, becomes a death-defying act. And he has been given a co-star of comparable firepower in the throaty siren Helen Mirren as the captain's adversarial helpmate, Alice, who bursts into glorious artificial bloom in the second act. The production as a whole, directed by Sean Mathias, doesn't entirely live up to its leading couple. As the third member of the play's triangle, David Strathairn takes his character's passivity past the vanishing point. And there are chafing discrepancies in tone throughout. Still, watching Mr. McKellen shooting off sparks in the dark mouth of mortality is about as thrilling as theater gets (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $90 (Ben Brantley).

VHere are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. MANUEL ASITIMBAY A Dream Realized Manuel Asitimbay's life revolved around his children -- two 13-year-old twin boys he had not seen since they were 6 months old, an 8-year-old boy he supported financially even though he was not his biological father, and a 4-year-old son who lived with him and his wife, Carmen Mejias, in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Mr. Asitimbay, 36, was an immigrant from Ecuador who was proud to work as a cook at Windows on the World. He took such joy in the food he prepared and carefully arranged on the plates of his customers that he would take pictures of his favorite dishes to show to friends and relatives.

They wanted to know why. The man, Zwi Haim Harris, told the firefighters that he lived on the seventh floor, and led them to an apartment, prosecutors said yesterday. When the door was opened, they said, the firefighters saw marijuana on the living room table.

VIn contradictory and at times bizarre testimony, one of the confessed killers of a rabbi's wife said today that he had hit her twice in the head with a pipe and had shared as much as $12,500 with the other killer. The man, Paul M. Daniels, was precise in describing his role in the 1994 killing of Carol Neulander, 52, the wife of Rabbi Fred J. Neulander, who is on trial here on charges that he had hired Mr. Daniels's roommate to kill her.

VExactly two weeks after terrorists ambushed New York and Washington, killed more than 5,000 of us and changed everything, and nothing, Aaron Sorkin, creator of ''The West Wing,'' leans anxiously against a long table filled with actors and production assistants. This is the high-tech briefing area where the show's main character, President Josiah Bartlet, huddles with the military brass when make-believe blips on the radar grow alarming. In the conspicuously insider patois of the show, the space is called ''the Sit Room,'' and this is roughly the Situation: for the last two years, ''West Wing'' has become one of the most popular shows in America because, among other things, Sorkin has been able to give his kinder, gentler, nobler White House enough verisimilitude to seem tantalizingly possible. ''The only reason it's not 'Touched by an Angel,''' Sorkin says, ''is that it imitates just enough the sounds and appearance of reality. And the way I do it is by saying words you don't normally hear on television shows, like 'Democrat' and 'Republican,' and having the place look real and the hardware look real and abbreviations be right. If I can do just enough of that, then hopefully we're on board.'' To maintain his elusive parallel universe, one that feels contemporary but is also impossible to pin down in time, Sorkin employs a half-dozen former high-ranking politicos and keeps a close watch ''on the dials and gauges.'' To come up with the four or five story lines the show burns through each episode, the staff reheats old issues from the archives or imagines something plausible enough to have actually happened. What they do not do, however, is dramatize recent headlines. They try to never mention any president after Eisenhower, and according to a co-executive producer, Kevin Falls, who runs the writers' room, ''When we talk about the Kennedy Center on 'West Wing,' we're referring to George Kennedy.''

VYOU would think that a guy who titled his first novel ''Shopgirl'' and set its melancholy love story against the backdrop of department store consumption would be an astute observer of the act of shopping. But Steve Martin -- actor, playwright, director, man with an arrow through his head, wild and crazy guy in tight plaid double-knit slacks, etc. -- does not include ''shopaholic'' on his list of vocations. He didn't even understand why a reporter would want to observe his shopping style on the occasion of the publication of ''Shopgirl'' in paperback this month.

VArmed with a favorable ruling from the Supreme Court, the Bush administration has begun its first major crackdown on the distribution of marijuana for medical purposes, Justice Department officials say. In the last month, federal agents in California have uprooted a marijuana garden run by patients, seized the files of a doctor and lawyer who recommended the drug for thousands of sick clients and raided one of the state's largest cannabis clubs, in West Hollywood, where more than 900 people with ailments like cancer and AIDS bought the drug with the blessing of city officials.

Mr. Peres also said he had drafted a new peace plan, one that called for a Palestinian state, but would not make its details public until Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had reviewed it. A10 Milosevic Calls Trial a 'Farce' Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslav president facing an array of charges, including genocide, at the international tribunal at The Hague, told the judges he would fight until the tribunal was overthrown, and he called the trial a farce. The court said his trial could begin in February. A6

VHOLLYWOOD would love to know what America wants to see at the movies this holiday season. (If only we knew ourselves.) Some big films have been moved to 2002, in hopes that times will be better or, as we say wistfully every day, ''back to normal.'' A few serious, possibly Oscar-worthy pictures will open over the next two months, but the sure thing this season is fantasy. Thank God for Harry Potter and hobbits and time travel and terrifying stories set in a distant future that has nothing to do with us. NOVEMBER

VA new Portuguese law eliminates jail time for possession or use of small amounts of any illegal drug and instead sends drug users to a panel of experts, who provide assistance. Jail sentences have been replaced with mandatory counseling or treatment and possibly community service or a fine of up to 30,000 escudos, about $130. The panels consist of a psychologist, a social worker and a legal adviser, who decide what action to take.

VTaking square aim at a measure approved twice by voters in Oregon, Attorney General John Ashcroft authorized federal agents yesterday to take action against doctors who prescribe lethal drugs for terminally ill patients. Oregon is the only state and one of the few places in the world where people are allowed to kill themselves with a doctor's prescription. Under the state's so-called Death with Dignity Act, a terminally ill patient may take the lethal drugs if two doctors agree the person has less than six months to live and is mentally competent to make the decision to end his or her life.

VThe San Francisco district attorney, Terence Hallinan, asked the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to stop cracking down on dispensers of marijuana for medical use. Mr. Hallinan, the only district attorney in California who actively campaigned for the voter initiative that legalized such marijuana, said that in recent weeks, two San Francisco dispensaries had been under surveillance by unidentified agents and patients' records had been seized from a doctor's office in El Dorado County and from the largest cannabis dispensary in Los Angeles, which was forced to close.

But he has not yet understood what a wartime president has to do at home: Put aside ideological politics so he can be president of all the people. With his evident approval, the ideologues in his administration are riding their conservative hobbyhorses as if the country did not have a higher purpose now. They, and the president, seem oblivious to the way those actions threaten national unity.

VADRIAN BRIDGES was frowning. Even though Adrian, a Harlem eighth grader, sat in the social studies class of his favorite teacher, Mr. Crump, everyone saw that he wasn't happy. At the start of class, Mr. Crump, a fast-talking disciplinarian, stood at the front of a classroom whose blue walls glowed as bright as some of his students' faces and announced that everyone had a clean slate.

VOne week after moving to crack down on a California law allowing the distribution of marijuana for medical purposes, Attorney General John Ashcroft took on the Oregon law that allows physicians to prescribe lethal medication for terminally ill patients. Mr. Ashcroft directed federal drug agents to revoke the licenses of any doctor who does so, even though Oregonians upheld the law by 60 percent to 40 percent when a challenge to it arose on their ballot four years ago. A federal judge in Portland temporarily blocked Mr. Ashcroft, but many Oregonians remained enraged that a state's rights administration had sought to thwart the voters' will. Sam Howe Verhovek

VMEASURING the impact of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon has become a relentless exercise among economists, politicians, journalists, historians and everyday people. In its simplest terms, taking numeric stock of damages and changes is the necessary stuff of recovery --the basis for making decisions on the allocation of funds, the adjustment of interest rates, or at a more mundane level, whether to take that holiday trip to the Big Apple. But the counting ritual is also therapeutic -- a means for getting a handle on events that may still feel wildly out of control. It wasn't until I saw the second jetliner smash into the second tower that it really dawned on me: Terrorists were intent on destroying our society and our economy, wrote Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, in an essay for the National Association of Business Economics.

VBEING a backward-looking person, I was curious to know what The Times was like in its centenary year, 1951. I happen to have handy an original bound run of the newspaper from that era, in all its wood-pulp bulk and glory -- a set of issues that once looped and cavorted through the groaning machines that dwelled in the basement of 43rd Street, in an atmosphere heavy with ink mist and paper dust. So I pulled out some of the old volumes, set them on a long table and began turning my way through them. The 50's pages are bigger than today's by about the width of a current column. The passage of time has dyed them a Champagney hue; as they slowly rise and fall they bring to mind the intermittent wing strokes of some great hovering bird. There are fewer photographs and more monochrome Lord & Taylor fashion watercolors, signed by commercial artists, now forgotten, like Karnoff and Hood: these are deftly blurry, like Japanese sumi paintings of twigs and birds. Only in the magazine section, in the ads, are there four-color illustrations: ''It's HELLMANN'S the WHOLE-EGG Mayonnaise.''

V''For every crucifixion,'' John Ashcroft likes to say, ''a resurrection is waiting to follow,'' and, more than most people in Washington, he should know. Just a year ago, Mr. Ashcroft's future looked grim. He had lost his Senate seat after a single term -- to a dead man. He was not close to George W. Bush, whose own election was not yet assured. He was not Mr. Bush's first choice for attorney general, and when offered the job, he had to endure a bruising confirmation at the hands of his old Senate colleagues.

VIF there were a county capital for fizzled plans, it would be Davids Island. Situated a half-mile off the New Rochelle coast, the uninhabited 78-acre island, with views of Manhattan, has been the object of numerous redevelopment plans over the last three decades. Each one has failed in the face of fierce opposition from the New Rochelle public, but now, with great hope, officials have announced one more. For a century, Davids Island was used as an Army post called Fort Slocum. Then, in the late 1960's, the post was deactivated and Consolidated Edison bought the land from the federal government. The company proposed building a nuclear power plant, which prompted intense public protest. Consolidated Edison eventually pulled the plan and, in 1976, the company sold the island to New Rochelle for $1.

VWHEN Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters made their storied journey across America in 1964, they included a pilgrimage to Millbrook, N.Y., the Hudson Valley town where Timothy Leary had turned a Victorian mansion into a lab for his LSD experiments. The meeting was supposed to join the two wings of the nascent drug culture: Kesey's woolly West Coast hedonists and Leary's League of Spiritual Discovery. But the vibe was all wrong. The Pranksters, spilling from a 1939 bus labeled Furthur, came on like unwashed trouble; the Leary crowd, with their meditation rooms and trip diaries, seemed no fun. Leary, engaged in a three-day trip on an upper floor, never even came down to meet his guests. The diodes of the electric drug culture remained apart. Kesey, who died on Nov. 10 after surgery to treat liver cancer, might have been amused by the latest twists in the long, strange legacy of the psychedelic era. Talk about karma: eight days before his death, the Food and Drug Administration approved a pilot study of the club drug Ecstasy, also known as MDMA (3-4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine), for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder. And F.D.A.-approved trials of another psychedelic drug, psilocybin, as a treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder, are scheduled to begin at the University of Arizona in January. The studies mark the first therapeutic trials of psychedelic drugs in the United States since the 1970's.

VAMERICANS, whether they realize it or not, leave a trail of data with every life step. As soon as a person is married or divorced, basic details about the event go on file at the local courthouse for anybody to browse. The same can be said for anyone who has registered to vote, acquired a professional license, bought a piece of real estate, filed for bankruptcy, been convicted of a crime or simply moved and listed a new address and phone number. And those are just the public records. Other information -- like driving records, credit histories and Social Security numbers -- is available to companies and individuals under certain legal guidelines, for example, in cases when a person consents to a search of his past.

''I read in the newspaper that the only thing Stockport is famous for is the hat museum,'' said Darren Ince, 32, a retail manager, on his way to secure a joint or two at the cafe recently. ''I didn't know we were even famous for that.''

VTo the Editor: Contrary to the assertion of Garrett Epps (Op-Ed, Nov. 20), Attorney General John Ashcroft has not impinged upon states' rights. Rather, it is Oregon that is violating the rules of federalism by permitting doctors to use federally controlled substances for lethal rather than medical purposes. Oregon had the ability to legalize assisted suicide, but the state statute does not prevent the federal government from enforcing federal law. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously last spring in the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative case that the states cannot nullify sections of the Controlled Substances Act with which they disagree. If that was true of medical marijuana in California, it is doubly true of using controlled substances to kill in Oregon.

VTHE Taliban will go down in history for many reasons, but their determination to encode in law their unique vision of an Islamic society will certainly be one. When the Taliban took power in the mid-1990's, they strove to reestablish security. And they imposed a strict penal code, whose particulars reveal not only the range and kinds of restrictions Afghans were subject to, but also the immense power given to those charged with its enforcment: the officials of the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.

V'Bill Clinton is a relic of another age,'' the essayist Lance Morrow wrote in Time magazine, ''like the 20's party boy F. Scott Fitzgerald stranded in the landscape of the Great Depression.'' I rise today to our immediate past president's linguistic defense. Let me tell you about the very articulate. They are different from you and me. The Lexicographic Irregulars, asked in this space to choose the phrases that Bill Clinton would be remembered by, responded with words that evoke an era of intense controversy and vituperation. Respondents included his critics and his speechwriters, those nostalgic for the time of prosperity and peace as well as for the days of whine and nosiness.

VIT is amazing but true. I am in the riverside town of Vang Vieng, Laos, standing on a bamboo bridge that spans the 150-yard breadth of the Nam Song, yet I am reminded, of all things, of the Garden State Parkway. This is because the man barring my way is demanding a toll: 1,000 kips for me, plus the same for my rented mountain bike. I look the bridge up and down; it is rickety, to say the least, maybe five feet wide, sagging with the accumulated weight of pedestrians past. Its surface is missing substantial patches in places, creating treacherous bamboo potholes.

VA trucking company and six of its officers and employees have been indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute tons of marijuana by concealing it on tractor-trailers that were driven throughout the country. The company, Coleman Commercial Carriers, with offices in California and Maryland, transported the marijuana on behalf of drug-trafficking organizations from 1997 until last month, according to an indictment unsealed last week in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Drug Enforcement Administration agents have seized more than 8,000 pounds of marijuana from trucks operated by Coleman, according to the indictment. The company made $50 million on the operation, the indictment charged. Jane Fritsch (NYT)

Outside, an unusually large crowd of photographers and reporters had gathered. They were all waiting to see if Robert A. Durst, the millionaire heir to a New York real estate fortune, would show up for his bail hearing. He had been charged with dismembering a 71-year-old man and tossing the body parts into Galveston Bay.

VLife imprisonment for a man who shoplifted a screwdriver, an electric razor and a map from a Kmart. The same sentence for one who tried to steal a meat slicer and a mixer from an International House of Pancakes. Twenty-five years to life for a homeless man who broke into a restaurant, only to come away with four chocolate chip cookies -- two in his left pocket, two in his right. Since a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled last month that a 50-year prison sentence for a videotape thief was cruel and unusual punishment, public defenders across the state have been digging up old cases to mount the first broad challenge to California's three-strikes law in years.

VThe Supreme Court took a long-awaited next step today in its continuing re-examination of the respective roles of judges and juries in criminal sentencing, accepting a case that could call into question several important federal sentencing provisions and perhaps the federal sentencing guidelines themselves. On the surface, the question in the case is a narrow one: whether a jury, rather than a judge, must make the finding that a defendant was ''brandishing'' a gun -- and not just carrying it -- in the course of committing a drug offense. Under a federal law known as Section 924(c), ''brandishing'' leads to a seven-year mandatory minimum sentence, while carrying a gun brings a minimum sentence of five years.

VA new statewide medical marijuana program has not attracted as many people as expected since it took effect on June 1. At the six-month mark of the voter-approved measure, 101 people had applied to use the drug for medical purposes, with 98 people approved. Officials had predicted that 600 to 800 people would sign up in the first year, as was the case with a similar program in Oregon. Applicants must register with the state to possess six marijuana plants or maximum of two ounces. But unlike California, Colorado does not have any clubs for patients to acquire marijuana.

VResearch on the medical uses of marijuana is scheduled to begin early next year, for the first time in nearly two decades, now that the government has approved new experiments to test whether smoking it can help patients who have multiple sclerosis or who suffer from pain in their limbs as a result of AIDS. The new approvals, granted on Nov. 28 by the Drug Enforcement Administration, do not make it legal for doctors to give their patients marijuana as treatment; they merely provide for limited use in scientific experiments. In some states, state law allows doctors to prescribe or recommend marijuana; federal law prohibits the practice, however, even in those states.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-11 India Demands Pakistan Act Against Militant Group India blamed a militant Islamic group that operates openly in Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Taiba, for a suicide attack that killed seven people at the Indian Parliament. India also demanded that Pakistan halt the group's activities, take its leaders into custody and cut off its financial assets. Pakistan said India had no proof of the group's involvement and warned India not to strike back. A1 Israel Raids Palestinian Towns Israeli troops killed six members of the Palestinian security force in a predawn stealth raid in Salfit, in the West Bank, and then went door-to-door arresting several suspected militants. Similar operations were mounted in three other Palestinian communities, resulting in two more deaths and at least 18 more arrests. No Israeli soldiers were reported injured. Israeli warplanes resumed attacks in the Gaza Strip, bombing an empty complex used by Yasir Arafat's elite guard. A6

VFederal officials today charged 35 people with running an international cocaine and heroin smuggling ring that used women traveling with infants -- some of them ''rented'' from poor families -- to transport drugs in cans of baby formula. ''This operation preyed on the great respect that we as human beings all afford mothers and babies -- and betrayed that respect brazenly,'' Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, said in announcing the indictments here this morning. ''Renting babies for the purpose of allowing drug dealers to smuggle cocaine is truly a new low.''

VHeightened security after the Sept. 11 attacks has had a major side effect: seizures of illegal drugs along the nation's borders and at its ports of entry increased substantially in October and November over the corresponding period a year ago, law enforcement authorities say. The greatest increase, 326 percent, was in seizures from commercial traffic along the Canadian border. But the overall figure was also large: the amount of drugs seized from commercial traffic -- that is, from trucks, ships and planes -- at all borders and ports was up 66 percent, the Customs Service says.

VThe clouds of marijuana smoke wafting through ''How High'' are so thick that at moments the haze from all that ganja threatens to obscure the actors' faces. This chaotic mess of a film, starring the rap stars Method Man and Redman as a hip-hop Cheech and Chong, has the disjointed quality of a stoned-out fantasy. Many of the faces that emerge through the murk appear bug-eyed. And much of the dialogue, which is frequently shouted, is only semi-intelligible. The movie, directed by Jesse Dylan from a screenplay by Dustin Lee Abraham, is so loosely constructed that its scenes don't track. At heart ''How High'' is a joshing, sardonic ode to ''blunts and booty'' that preaches the same message as a 60's hippie flick exalting the liberating potential of pot, but in a different language. A couple of tokes of magic weed, it suggests, will set you free. Once Silas (Method Man) and Jamal (Redman), two pot-smoking buddies, land at Harvard, the staid university is helpless against the power of their stash, gleaned from a plant nurtured by the ashes of Silas's best friend, Ivory (Chuck Davis), who accidentally incinerated himself. In a matter of weeks Harvard turns into the hardest partying school on the planet.

VIf there is such thing as final redemption for James J. Hamm, it is fast approaching: he may soon be practicing law in the same state where the laws once did not much matter to him. As a drug-addled drifter from Kansas, Mr. Hamm and a friend led two men into the Arizona desert near Tucson 27 years ago on the pretense of selling them drugs. Instead, they stole the money and shot the buyers to death. Later, Mr. Hamm and his accomplice pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for sentences of 25 years to life.

VAlthough the Supreme Court has decided many cases growing out of encounters between police officers and bus passengers, the constitutional ground rules for these tense interactions remain unclear. Today the justices agreed to try again to define the boundary between a search to which a bus passenger has freely consented -- and that is therefore permissible despite the absence of a warrant or probable cause -- and one that is inherently coercive and therefore an unconstitutional seizure. The new case, one of eight the court accepted today for argument in April, is an appeal by the federal government from a ruling by the federal appeals court in Atlanta in October 2000. That court overturned the narcotics convictions of two men, passengers on an interstate bus, who agreed to a pat-down search by police officers who boarded the bus when it stopped at a Greyhound station in Tallahassee, Fla.

Mr. Kelly and Mayor Michael R.

VThe Queens district attorney, Richard A.

The drugs included Ecstasy, cocaine, marijuana and prescription medications. A Manhattan hospital chemist, a Brooklyn doctor and the other defendants are charged with various counts of criminal sale and possession of controlled substances and conspiracy. The battalion chief, Robert Gleason, 43, who has since retired, had become addicted to painkillers after an on-the-job injury, his lawyer, Stephen G. Murphy, said. ''If he had not taken them, he could not have gone to work,'' Mr. Murphy said. Hope Reeves (NYT)

VFOR decades, the halls of Linda Brady's co-op on East 18th Street were redolent with a comforting mix of old-fashioned smells: L'Air du Temps perfume, takeout Chinese food, fabric softener. That was because her 1960's-era building, like scores of other white glazed-brick high-rises that are ubiquitous on the East Side of Manhattan, had a large number of occupants who were women like herself -- single, well employed and now over 50. Such buildings, mostly made up of studios and one-bedroom apartments, had a reputation for dowdiness and were considered architectural eyesores by purists, but Ms. Brady loved hers, and the women who were her neighbors.

VArticle on three-year-old program, implemented by Comr Patrick Carroll of New Rochelle, NY, three years ago, that sent single police officers to patrol on foot city's two predominantly black public housing projects; only two officers, Claudio Carpano and Joe Berardi, both rookies and neither black, volunteered for duty; serious crime has declined 33 percent since 1996 and Berardi and Carpano, who have decided to continue on their beats, have gained trust and respect of community; photos (L)

VPrince Charles sent his son Harry to a drug clinic in August to meet recovering addicts after learning that he was drinking and smoking marijuana, and experts today praised his action as responsible parenting -- not a phrase commonly applied to the ruling Windsor family. Charles discovered that Harry, then 16, had been using the drug at private parties and at Charles's Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire. Harry had also been drinking at a nearby country pub last summer while his father was away in London on royal duties and his brother, William, 19, was out of the country on his gap year before university.

VHis performance was not quite like Willis Reed's limping into Madison Square Garden to lead the Knicks in Game 7 of the 1970 N.B.A. finals, but Charlie Garner, the diminutive Oakland running back, provided plenty of playoff heroics last Saturday night in a 38-24 victory over the Jets. His season-high 158 rushing yards, including an 80-yard touchdown run, was a big reason why the Raiders are preparing for an American Football Conference divisional playoff game Saturday night against New England.

VThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that in evaluating whether ''reasonable suspicion'' existed for a police officer to detain a suspect briefly for questioning, courts should pay more attention to the officer's experience and the event's overall context than to possibly innocent explanations for individual parts of the incident. The case concerned a federal border patrol agent's stop of a minivan carrying two adults and three children on an unpaved road in a remote area of southern Arizona. The vehicle was found to be carrying 128 pounds of marijuana, but the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that the stop was unconstitutional.

The results, released on Tuesday, also did not show traces of Accutane, an acne medication with reported links to depression or suicide.

VThe first study to track extremely premature infants into adulthood has found that despite frequent physical and learning disabilities that often prevent them from attending college, these ''preemies'' are nearly as likely to complete high school as children of normal birth weight, and less likely to engage in risky behavior. Because infants born at very low birth weights often have learning problems, the study's authors had believed that like other children who fare poorly in school, these would be more likely to experiment with alcohol and drugs, become pregnant as teenagers and run into trouble with the law as young adults. But the research found just the opposite.

VLOOKING today at the Windermere, the massive eight-story apartment building at the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 57th Street, it is hard to imagine that for its first few years it was a grande dame of New York apartment life. But there are ample clues that the structure at 400-406 West 57th Street was once an architectural jewel. Built in 1881, it is the second-oldest large apartment house in the borough. Only the Manhattan on 86th Street and Second Avenue, dating from 1880, is older. The Windermere's imposing patterned arrowhead cornice still proudly faces north. Intricate brickwork and three-story bow-front windows are telltale signs that its builders relished the architectural eclecticism of the 1880's. In its prime, many of the Windermere's occupants could be found nestled in the pages of Phillips' Elite Directory, the bible of upper-class New Yorkers and their prestigious addresses.

VLAST week's shootings at Martin Luther King Jr. High School summoned conflicting views about safety in the city's schools. City officials were quick to say that school crime has fallen sharply in recent years. ''The schools in New York City are much safer than they were three or five years ago,'' said Harold O. Levy, the schools chancellor. Referring to the incident at King, where two students were shot last Tuesday, he added, ''I want to make sure this is an anomaly, and not a pattern.''

VThe soap opera saga that is the British royal family ran another episode about a misbehaving member of its younger generation. But this one ended on a novel note -- praise for good parenting. When Prince Charles found out that his son Harry had been drinking and smoking marijuana as a 16-year-old last summer, he arranged for the young prince to spend a day at a London drug clinic to see the consequences of addiction. Charles's action drew front page sympathy in a country with the highest incidence of teenage drinking and drug-taking in Europe. Warren Hoge

VIn this storied state, home to name-brand colleges, name-brand history and name-brand politicians, one of the only things we don't market well to outsiders is governors. Michael Dukakis, for instance -- or Calvin Coolidge: decent men both, but about as charismatic as scrod. The problem seems to be that while Massachusetts Democrats are too liberal, Massachusetts Republicans are, well, too liberal. We are currently witnessing the freakish yet familiar spectacle of Republicans wooing Democrats. Not because they want to, necessarily, but because they have to: in the Commonwealth Democrats outnumber Republicans by at least three to one, and studies show that the average voter has met, if not had chowder with, 1.4 Kennedys. The only way a Republican can win statewide office is to act like a liberal Democrat. When the occasion demands, at least.

VKatharine Whittemore Op-Ed article surveys Massachusetts political scene and gubernatorial race in light of state's strong liberal traditions, where both Democrats and Republicans are both 'too liberal,' resulting in current spectacle of Republicans wooing Democrats; notes that latest round of 'morphing' comes to us from Gov Jane Swift, Republican, who recently named Patrick C Guerriero, one of her senior staff members who is openly gay, to be her running mate (M)

VJohn Arthur Love, a former Republican governor of Colorado and energy czar in the Nixon administration, died on Monday. He was 85 and lived in Denver. Mr. Love had only limited political experience when he was elected to the first of three terms as governor in 1963. He defeated an incumbent Democrat and stayed in office for 10 years, becoming the state's longest-serving governor at the time.

Durst, the New York real estate heir, will soon leave his gritty cell in a 19th-century prison here for Texas, where he will spend months in a county jail awaiting trial on a murder charge. Mr. Durst waived extradition to Texas today during a hearing at the Northampton County Courthouse. Sheriff's deputies from Galveston County, Tex., are expected to get custody of him this weekend and take him back to Galveston on a commercial flight.

VThe party is taking off, but Danny Kass is nowhere to be found. At Trax, a dance club on a Bend, Ore., highway, a couple hundred snowboarders are unwinding while a band called Red i Rider pumps out its own twisted brand of rockabilly, a twangy cover of Ice-T's ''Cop Killer,'' the drummer pounding out the beat wearing a sequined face mask that's two parts Hannibal Lecter, one part Liberace. It's a snowboarder's nirvana -- $1.50 Buds, cute local girls and a band so loud you can't hear yourself think. ''It's got kind of a freaky vibe, and it's only going to get freakier after it breaks up here and heads to the strip club next door,'' says Amen Teter, general manager of the Palmer Snowboard team. ''You won't find a party like this at the Olympics.''

VIT is late afternoon on a workday, but Joseph Santiago's soft gray, wool worsted, four-button suit still has its razor-sharp creases. He is wearing a fitted, cotton-blend, monogrammed dress shirt with widely spaced maroon stripes to match the maroon silk tie and maroon braces. The shirt's custom-made, four-inch-high tab collar masks an unusually long neck. Mr. Santiago is trim and muscled from daily workouts, and he has a golden complexion that is so even it looks as if it were carefully painted on.

VThe New Jersey Supreme Court reinstated drug charges today against a California woman who had persuaded two lower courts that she was a victim of racial profiling when she was detained upon arrival at Newark International Airport four years ago. Racial profiling is a contentious issue in New Jersey, where state troopers have a history of stopping drivers based on the color of their skin. Prosecutors and civil rights lawyers were divided in assessing the significance of today's ruling.

VDawn was 12 when she started smoking marijuana with her friends. It was just something the cool kids did to relax and forget their problems, she says. But, after a while, the cigar-shaped ''blunts'' she smoked also seemed to make learning difficult. ''I would just forget school stuff,'' said Dawn, now 17. ''I'd learn something one day and the next day I'd have no idea what the teacher was talking about.''

VTo the Editor: The fact that there never has been and never will be a drug-free society is perhaps the strongest argument for taxing and regulating the sale of marijuana to adults (''Marijuana's Effects: More Than Munchies,'' Jan. 29). There will always be a small segment of the population predisposed to excessive drug use. I personally know alcoholics who have turned their lives around by putting down the bottle and picking up the marijuana pipe. They may still have a substance abuse problem, but now they can get out of bed without hangovers and lead productive lives.

In May 1987, Bruce Godschalk, 26, who had been working for a landscaper, was convicted of both rapes, largely on the basis of a confession to detectives that he recanted long before his trial. He was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison.

VTara Dakides sat comfortably behind the wheel of her Cadillac Escalade as it gulped down the paper-clip bends in the mountain roads before her earlier this week. She was on her way to yet another snowboard event, and if she needed guidance, there was always the OnStar button. Her internal compass has its limits, though: It won't direct her to the Olympics. As one of the best freestyle snowboarders in America, Dakides competes everywhere, but she will not journey to the Winter Games.

VMany stars of extreme winter sport of snowboarding will not compete in Olympics, having already gained six-figure salaries and star status from X Games; even as Olympic movement craves involvement from disconnected children and NBC strives to lure dream demographics, some of coolest stars of extreme sports, like Tara Dakides, are turning away from what they view as corporate pomp of Olympic medal scene; some snowboarders are torn on issue; there is also ambivalence toward extreme athletes from inside Olympic structure; Olympians are customarily expected to fit certain wholesome ideal; some International Olympic Committee members bristle at irreverence of snowboard rebels like Danny Kass, American with history of outrageous conduct; these same officials were desperate to introduce snowboarding at 1998 Nagano Games after watching participation levels double while skiing lost ground; photos (L)

Now authorities in Queens say they have found a brand of the drug called bin Laden, as in Osama. Yesterday, four women were arrested and charged with drug possession after police in Hollis discovered they were carrying cocaine, marijuana and the bin Laden heroin. It was in glassine envelopes with bin Laden in red letters on the front and the image of an airplane heading toward the World Trade Center on the back. Sarah Kershaw (NYT)

VHoping to give an appeals court time to rule, the Drug Enforcement Administration said yesterday that it would extend a grace period for companies to dispose of food products made from hemp, a plant containing small amounts of the same psychoactive substance found in marijuana. In early October, shortly after Asa Hutchinson became D.E.A. administrator, the agency issued a rule that effectively banned ''any product that contains any amount'' of the active substance in marijuana, known as tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.

VGlobal Crossing Faces 2 Federal Investigations Global Crossing, the fiber-optic network operator in bankruptcy court protection, is facing two federal investigations of its accounting practices. The inquiries come at a time when the collapse of Enron has led to increased concern among investors over accounting issues. The Securities and Exchange Commission has begun an inquiry into accusations that Global Crossing improperly inflated its revenue, the company disclosed yesterday. And law enforcement officials said that the F.B.I. was examining the company after receiving accusations of wrongdoing including fraudulent conduct. [Page A1.] A Push to Help the Uninsured A lobbying group that includes the United States Chamber of Commerce, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the American Medical Association is planning a campaign to push for measures intended to reduce the number of people without health insurance. Economists say that at least 40.4 million people are uninsured. [A12.]

VPatrick T. is prone to citing Oscar Wilde and the physicist Michio Kaku. He's so well spoken, his manners polished to such a high gloss, that -- aside from the fact that he's been a methamphetamine addict and career criminal since age 13 whose only formal education is a high-school degree earned in juvenile detention -- he could blend easily into a gathering of witty young professionals. Certainly he is equally engaged by his work. Until recently, Patrick often earned his living robbing drug dealers and the occasional small business. ''There's a lot of thought and energy that goes into getting loaded and planning a crime,'' he explains. ''It's dramatic -- the excitement, the carefree feeling that comes when you succeed. That's not something that happens in the monotone of everyday life. That's why for me, feeding my mind and spirit will be as important as anything I do in terms of abstaining. Because if I get bored. . . . '' He lets the threat hang, unspoken. Patrick is 30, tall and rangy, with sandy, short-cropped hair and a neatly trimmed goatee. He and I are in the small library of Center Point, a substance-abuse treatment facility in San Rafael, Calif., about half an hour north of San Francisco, where he is enrolled in a six-month residential program. Patrick is a ''retread'': this is his second time through here in a year, initially in exchange for a suspended sentence on charges of possessing drugs and stolen property. He completed the program last June and got a job restoring boats in Sausalito, convinced that his own ship had finally come in. But within five weeks he had moved from swallowing pain pills for a bad back to downing a couple of beers with his older brother. Then he started lighting up a few joints. In less than two months, he headed to San Francisco on a meth binge. He had planned to stay high until his money ran out, he was arrested for violating probation or he died. But one night, holed up in a transient hotel with an old crime partner and a prostitute, Patrick had a revelation. ''I was suddenly disgusted with the whole scene,'' he recalls. ''I had this thought -- or this thought was given to me -- that I just couldn't do it anymore. I just couldn't.'' He called Center Point and said he needed help. Within 24 hours he was back.

VTHE BEAUTY OF THE HUSBAND: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos, by Anne Carson. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) This Canadian poet, whose unclassifiable work is steeped in a deep knowledge of Hellenic literature as well as philosophy, fiction and other fields, brings her elusive, free-associative style to bear on the story of a marital breakup and ''the dilemma of desire.'' Last year our reviewer, Daphne Merkin, was struck by Carson's ''refusal to edit out the personal, even at its most pathetically lovelorn,'' and said, ''I don't think there has been a book since Robert Lowell's 'Life Studies' that has advanced the art of poetry quite as radically.'' THE END OF TIME: The Next Revolution in Physics, by Julian Barbour. (Oxford University, $16.95.) Here's a daunting premise: time does not exist. A theoretical physicist replaces the conventional notion of reality with a ''many worlds'' interpretation of the universe that accounts for our temporal experiences even as it refines Einstein's ideas about space, time and gravity. Remarkably, this is ''a wonderfully accessible book'' in which ''Barbour leaves his mark on every topic he considers, including the arrow of time and the origins of the Big Bang,'' Simon W. Saunders wrote here in 2000. DIRTY HAVANA TRILOGY: A Novel in Stories, by Pedro Juan Gutirrez. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $13.95.) The supremely macho narrator of this Cuban novel is a former journalist who has fallen out with the Castro regime and been reduced to poverty in Havana, where only marijuana and sex (mostly the latter) keep him afloat. The tale ''is not only entertaining; it's also curiously uplifting as it illuminates the darker places of a society on the brink,'' Karl Taro Greenfeld said in the Book Review last year. BELLOW: A Biography, by James Atlas. (Modern Library, $16.95.) In his encyclopedic portrait of the writer Saul Bellow (still going strong in his latter 80's), the author beat all the bushes to trace his personal life and achievements, drawing on more than a decade's worth of research. ''A biographer more scrupulous than Atlas is hard to imagine,'' John Leonard wrote here in 2000. ''I could no more stop reading his biography than I could stop reading Saul Bellow after he blew the blinds off the windows in my head.'' ISLAM'S BLACK SLAVES: The Other Black Diaspora, by Ronald Segal. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.) Slavery in the Muslim world began long before the Atlantic slave trade but has been much less documented. The author examines its roots, its purposes and its persistence today in places like Sudan and Mauritania. Last year our reviewer, Adam Hochschild, found the narrative bland but said, ''Segal deserves great credit for putting the history of Islamic slavery on the record in a carefully documented way.'' SISTER INDIA, by Peggy Payne. (Riverhead, $14.) This novel's fierce protagonist is a 400-pound American woman who tries to banish a horrific sin from her memory by fleeing to the holy Indian city of Varanasi, where she runs a guesthouse and walls herself off until a violent event frees her from her past. ''Payne has created one of the more unsettling and mesmerizing characters in expatriate literature,'' Deborah Mason wrote here in 2001. AMONG THE MISSING, by Dan Chaon. (Ballantine, $12.95.) The people wandering through these short stories -- some die, some bear witness, some survive and others simply vanish -- are always coming and going, with little certainty but lots of questions about their inner lives. The collection is unnerving but ''hums with life and wry humor,'' our reviewer, Beverly Lowry, wrote in 2001. The tales ''sneak resolutely up on you, like new weather that hits before you know it.'' BERLIN IN LIGHTS: The Diaries of Count Harry Kessler (1918-1937). Translated and edited by Charles Kessler. (Grove, $17.) A member of the German upper crust, an aesthete with a social conscience, chronicles life in Europe between the wars, and his encounters with such figures as Einstein and Jean Cocteau. ''What distinguishes his diary . . . is Kessler's distanziert tone -- its elegance, precision and shrewdness,'' Iain Bamforth said here in 2000. THE FORGER, by Paul Watkins. (Picador USA, $14.) This intricately plotted novel revolves around an American painter living in Paris in 1939 who is recruited to forge works by old masters that can be traded to Nazi art dealers for genuine masterpieces. Watkins can ''create a wartime sensibility in which every footfall on the stairs has you holding your breath in anticipation,'' Katharine Weber wrote here in 2000. Scott Veale

VThe trophy houses, with wrought-iron gates and grand-columned entryways, keep popping up on little country roads here, in clearings in the piney woods and near doublewide trailers. Sometimes there is a Mercedes or two in the driveway. In the affluent suburbs of Boston, New York or Dallas, these fake chateaus might belong to successful doctors, lawyers or software company owners. But Prentiss, a small town in south-central Mississippi, has no industry or affluent professional class in the conventional sense. The last sizable factory moved to Mexico three years ago, leaving an unemployment rate of 25 percent.

VThe diet police may get after me for saying this, but last-minute shoppers for Valentine's Day (or for any occasion, for that matter) might consider chocolate -- that dark, sweet, melt-in-your-mouth treat that, while not exactly a love potion, is almost universally loved and is not the health disaster that many people assume it to be. In fact, nutritionally speaking, you could do a lot worse. Recent evidence suggests that chocolate -- especially expensive dark chocolate -- is replete with substances that may actually enhance well-being as well as improve one's mood. After all, chocolate does come from the seed of the Theobroma tree, and theobroma is Greek for ''food of the gods.''

VThe cabinet forwarded to Parliament a commission recommendation that the use of marijuana in private or for medicinal or religious reasons be legalized, Information Minister Colin Campbell said. The recommendation, made in August 2001, said marijuana use should remain illegal for minors and in public places, and that cultivation and exportation should remain outlawed. Under current law, possession of one marijuana cigarette is punishable by a small fine or up to 10 days in jail. A parliamentary committee will decide whether the law should be changed. No timetable has been set.

VFederal agents raided three medical marijuana clubs, in San Francisco, Oakland and Petaluma, arresting four people and adding fuel to a dispute between local and federal officials. The administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Asa Hutchinson, met a hostile audience later in the day at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco as he explained the Bush Administration's stepped up drug war. The San Francisco district attorney, Terence Hallinan, said that city officials had not been informed of the raid and that it and Mr. Hutchinson's simultaneous visit were the latest insults in an ongoing battle between local and federal officials. ''The city's chief law officials do not agree with the federal government's actions,'' Mr. Hallinan said. Mr. Hutchinson said the raid was apolitical and reflected the drug agency's responsibility to uphold federal law.

VWhen an undertaker and his young apprentice were found shot dead in a funeral home here on a sunny afternoon last week, this town became intrigued over the inevitable question of who was responsible for the killings, the first in Hudson in 24 years. The police say they are following at least 10 leads in the Feb. 5 crime. But perhaps the most intriguing came the day after the killings, when the head of the state funeral home association told the authorities that an obscure Christian anti-embalming group had been sending threatening letters to funeral homes, including the one in Hudson, since early last year.

VSeven months after a 14-year-old boy died from exposure at an unregulated boot camp for troubled youth near Phoenix, the head of the camp, Charles F. Long II, was arrested yesterday and charged with second-degree murder. Mr. Long, 56, who calls himself a colonel in the America's Buffalo Soldiers Re-enactors Association, the organization that runs the camp, was also charged with eight counts of child abuse, aggravated assault -- he is accused of putting a knife to the throat of an 18-year-old at the camp -- and marijuana possession. A charge of second-degree murder means the crime was not premeditated, but the defendant created the conditions that caused the death.

VA jury has convicted four men of running a transcontinental drug ring that trucked thousands of pounds of marijuana monthly to New York from California. The men -- Carl Coleman, Winston Hilton, Barrington Irving and Solemn Joseph -- used an Oklahoma trucking company, where Mr. Coleman worked, to transport the drugs, then stored them in a Bronx house. They also sold drugs in Harlem, the Bronx, and Utica, N.Y. Convicted on Friday of narcotics conspiracy, they face a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment and a maximum of life in prison. Robert F. Worth (NYT)

VIn crimes that the authorities described as unimaginable, a 16-year-old boy has been charged with killing six people and wounding a seventh in shootings over two consecutive days this month in Camden County, N.J. Five of the people were apparently killed to cover the assailant's tracks, the authorities said. ''There is no excuse and there is no reason; it is just what it is,'' Lee A. Solomon, the Camden County prosecutor, said yesterday. ''You can't understand it and you can't explain it.''

VOne was a newlywed, the father of a year-old son. He was a 24-year-old food-service worker with plans to begin classes in computer science the following day. Another had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia and manic depression years earlier but had gone on to become a mental-health worker and an advocate for the mentally ill. Today, spontaneous memorials lined the wooden fence outside the pink concrete bungalow on Stevens Avenue, a bleak stretch of the West Atco section this Camden County township, where the authorities say that a 16-year-old had embarked upon a rampage that left six people dead earlier this month and a seventh injured. The young man, whom authorities have not identified, was arrested Friday.

VProsecutors plan to request as early as Tuesday that a 16-year-old charged with the murders of six people stand trial as an adult, officials said today. The Camden County district attorney, Lee A. Solomon, had been expected to make the request at a detention hearing in Family Court here today, but could not because the teenage boy did not have a lawyer. But after Judge Louis F. Hornstine of Superior Court ordered a pretrial hearing to be held on Tuesday, at which the teenager must be represented by a lawyer, Mr. Solomon said that he might file the request during that proceeding.

This ruined pleasure dome was once the palace of Francisco Arellano Flix, the eldest of the six brazen brothers who run Mexico's most powerful drug cartel. While Frankie and his siblings danced and drank, they also bribed every policeman and politician in sight, buying protection, building a multibillion-dollar family business on deals signed in blood.

VIT is almost dinner time in Kendall Cottage at Children's Village, a sprawling residential treatment center for boys. Broccoli is bubbling on the stove, and a game of Scrabble is under way in the dining room. Jason, 14, who arrived more than two years ago after drifting through five foster homes and a psychiatric hospital, is showing visitors with evident pride how neatly the bookshelves in the living room are kept, how the sneakers in the mud room are lined up just so. The residential cottage, one of 21 on the Dobbs Ferry campus, is a study of order, routine and tranquillity -- the opposite of what many of the children here have known.

VI remember the first time I saw Burt Lancaster, as the gossip columnist J.J. Hunsecker, watch a drunk get tossed out of a strip club and say, with satanic gusto, ''I love this dirty town.'' It was funny and horrible, riveting. For certain people, the 1957 movie ''Sweet Smell of Success'' has an almost ''Rocky Horror Picture Show'' cult appeal: we could, if called upon, recite whole chunks of its dialogue. As when Hunsecker puts a cigarette to his lips and casually orders the press agent Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis), ''Match me, Sidney.'' Or chuckles about the plausible deniability his web of favors and threats provides him: ''My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for 30 years.'' Or complains about his toadies: ''I often wish . . . I could shut out the greedy murmur of little men.'' The prospect of hearing John Lithgow, as Hunsecker, deliver those lines live on stage is enough by itself to get me to the Martin Beck Theater, where a new Broadway musical -- book by John Guare and music by Marvin Hamlisch -- is scheduled to open on March 14. At first glance, ''Sweet Smell,'' the movie and now the musical, is a period piece. But despite all the black-and-white Weegee-esque imagery -- Midtown in the mid-1950's, hideous and glamorous, skanky and cool, cigarettes ubiquitous, Checker cabs rumbling toward El Morocco -- Sweet Smell'' isn't just a time capsule, a chronicle of a bygone era's gothic final days. Because in fact, the era isn't bygone at all.

The clerk, Dennis Bram, 54, who has worked at the court since 1982, was charged with criminal sale of marijuana, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office said on Thursday. On Jan. 23, an undercover informant bought about $60 worth of marijuana from Mr. Bram and later bought marijuana worth $2,500, the spokesman said. Mr. Bram, who made $73,138 a year as a senior clerk, has been suspended without pay. Jacob H. Fries (NYT)

VHE'S a baby-faced, good-for-nothing drifter who just got out of jail. She's his ladylike big sister, who works at a bank, wears tasteful blouses and skirts, and lives with her 8-year-old son in a house where everything is in its place. But the nice thing about Samantha (Laura Linney) in YOU CAN COUNT ON ME (2000) is that she turns out to be just orderly, not saintly. In the course of the film, she uses four-letter words, smokes marijuana and commits adultery with her creepy new boss (Matthew Broderick). The brother, Terry (Mark Ruffalo), borrows money he'll never repay, takes his nephew (Rory Culkin) to a pool hall and almost destroys Samantha's house while trying to fix the plumbing. And there's no happy ending in sight. Kenneth Lonergan, who wrote and directed, is known to theater goers as the brilliant, youngish playwright of ''This Is Our Youth'' and to Robert De Niro fans as the screenwriter of ''Analyze This'' -- Saturday at 8 p.m. on Showtime.

VEverybody's getting into the original-movie act. Last weekend it was ESPN with ''A Season on the Brink,'' and tonight Court TV offers its first original film, ''Guilt by Association,'' a well-intentioned if heavy-handed effort to highlight inequities in the mandatory-sentencing laws of the Reagan years. Members of Congress, prepare for a barrage of e-mail protests. Mercedes Ruehl gives her usual solid performance, this time as a woman who goes to prison because her boyfriend was involved in a marijuana ring. Ms. Ruehl's character, Susan, is a single mother of two who finds the seemingly ideal guy in Russell (Alex Carter) but doesn't realize until too late that he is involved with drugs.

VDNA tests confirm that a man killed last month during a shootout with the police was Ramn Arellano Flix, one of the F.B.I.'s 10 most-wanted fugitives and a suspected leader of Mexico's most brutal drug gang, prosecutors said today. Assistant Attorney General Jos Jorge Campos announced at a news conference that the authorities had compared blood samples taken from Mr. Arellano Flix's jailed brother, Benjamn, with DNA evidence taken from bloodstains on the clothes of a man carrying phony police credentials that identified him as Jorge Prez Lopez.

VOVER a lazy SoHo breakfast, the Mexican director Alfonso Cuarn ponders the fact that his new movie, ''Y Tu Mam Tambin,'' is going into American theaters unrated. For fans of his English-language films, the 1995 children's movie ''A Little Princess'' and his 1998 update of ''Great Expectations,'' this one is a startling departure. ''We tried for an R,'' he says of ''Y Tu Mam,'' ''but I had to cut so much that it didn't make much sense. I figured that the movie would be an hour long. Then the PG-13 version would be 40 minutes, and the PG would be 20. And there's a G version that's 10 minutes including credits.'' A raffish comedy of sexual manners with a serious subtext, ''Y Tu Mam Tambin'' was scheduled for release by IFC Films in New York, Los Angeles and San Diego on Friday (and is to open next month in 22 cities, including Philadelphia, Boston and Atlanta). The movie is remarkable, so hilarious and wild that you barely notice its sober underpinnings until the end, which closes on the viewer like a trap that was set from the start. Defying more than one kind of hypocrisy, ''Y Tu Mam'' became a huge hit in Mexico last year despite government efforts to sink it. Starting with the impudent title (''And Your Mama, Too''), the movie is intended to startle and provoke, not with gratuitous vulgarity (the vulgarity is purposeful) but by using humor's cutting edge to lay bare the soft core of convention.

VI. SMELLS LIKE A PARADIGM SHIFT It must say something about the troubled American recording industry that the most warmly anticipated pop album scheduled for release this spring is one by an inwardly, bald 36-year-old artist whose music fits none of the industry's carefully cultivated niches; whose astounding rise has had to do mostly with his product being in all those outlets of popular culture that aren't aspects of the music industry; and whose ideas about what a pop album and, for that matter, a recording artist might be fly in the face of music-industry conventions honored more or less since the Beatles landed at Kennedy. Moby is not a band, or a singer-songwriter, exactly, or a producer, exclusively, or an ''electronic artist,'' strictly speaking, or a potty-mouthed rapper, for sure. One way or another he is present on every song he has ever made, since he does everything, or nearly everything, himself. But there is no way to tell if a song is a Moby song simply by recognizing the singer's voice or the style of music, and it is safe to say that most people who have ever heard a Moby song -- more likely in a television commercial or a movie trailer or a TV sitcom or even a clothing store than on the radio -- didn't know they were hearing a Moby song, though they probably liked it. Moby's last album, ''Play,'' was released in June 1999. It was his fourth album for a major label, and it was quietly hoped that it would sell as well as the most successful of the previous three: a respectable 150,000 copies. Instead, it became the most widely discussed and widely admired American pop recording that also happened to be widely purchased since Nirvana's 1991 triumph, ''Nevermind.'' To date, ''Play'' has sold nearly nine million copies worldwide. It is true that Moby did what all pop musicians do today when they want to move units. For more than a year after the release of ''Play,'' he spent almost all his time touring to promote it, or talking to interviewers to promote it, or appearing on late-night TV to promote it. It is also true that album sales were bolstered by numerous album-of-the-year-citations, four Grammy nominations, two MTV awards and a late-breaking hit single (a remix of the song ''South Side,'' with vocals by the young pop diva Gwen Stefani).

VThe legislature is considering a bill that would legalize the growing of marijuana for medical use. A 1983 state law allows marijuana prescriptions, but doctors, bowing to federal law, do not prescribe marijuana. State Representative James W. Abrams, Democrat of Meriden, said he sponsored legislation that would allow patients with a doctor's approval to grow just enough marijuana indoors to treat their ailments.

VNO HEROES A Memoir of Coming Home By Chris Offutt 268 pages. Simon & Schuster. $24. Chris Offutt grew up in a part of eastern Kentucky where ''don't reckon'' is the way to say no, and where grade school graduates wear caps and gowns because so few of them will make it through high school. He high-tailed it out of there, in ways he has already described. (He is the author of ''The Same River Twice,'' an exceptionally fine memoir, as well as a novel and two short-story collections.) Then, after a long absence, he decided to move back to the region with his wife and two children.

VEven in an era of expressive tattoos on basketball players, the display on Luke Walton's right shoulder prompts a double take. In blue dye on tanned white skin are drawings of four skeletons twirling basketballs on their fingers. The skeletons are symbols of the Grateful Dead, a band his famous father favors. The four figures represent Walton and his three brothers. The basketballs, of course, stand for the family game. ''There was a time when we didn't like the Grateful Dead,'' said Walton, a forward for Arizona. His father, Bill, used to play Grateful Dead music, and the sons went through ''that rebellious stage,'' Luke Walton said. ''Whatever he liked, we didn't.''

Thirty-eight cadets out of 4,300 have been implicated in the case, which mainly involves the use of Ecstasy and marijuana. In addition, six cadets have been charged or convicted of crimes like sodomy and larceny, including the former president of the class of 2003, who is accused of stealing $9,000 from a class activity fund.

VThe Supreme Court unleashed a potential revolution in criminal sentencing two years ago when it ruled that only the jury, and not a judge, could find a defendant eligible for a sentence above the range the legislature had specified for a crime. The decision, Apprendi v. New Jersey, not only invalidated New Jersey's hate-crime law but also called into question the basic sentencing system the federal government and many states use, in which the jury determines guilt but judges make the crucial factual findings -- the quantity of drugs, for example -- that determine the sentence.

VThe Supreme Court today interpreted a federal drug law to permit the eviction of public housing tenants for drug use by any household member or guest, even drug use that takes place outside the apartment without the tenant's knowledge. The 8-to-0 decision overturned a ruling by the federal appeals court in San Francisco, which had interpreted the provision of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to bar the eviction of ''innocent'' tenants who had neither knowledge of nor control over their family members' drug use.

VHerman Walker is getting too old for all this worry. His feet ache from 79 years of wear and tear; lingering complications from a stroke five years ago have him in and out of his doctor's office; and he is bone-tired. The last thing he needs to fret about is getting kicked out of his apartment and ending up on the street. ''I didn't do anything wrong,'' Mr. Walker said in a wavering voice after he was reached by phone at the one-bedroom apartment he has called home for more than 10 years.

VThe former N.F.L. defensive lineman Dexter Manley was sentenced to two years in jail yesterday, the maximum prison term, for evidence tampering after he was convicted of swallowing cocaine during a drug arrest at a Houston motel. After his conviction, Manley failed to show up for a court-ordered meeting. ''I do think that you need drug treatment,'' District Judge Elsa Alcala said. ''I do see that you do need mental health counseling because you are so self-destructive, but I also think you need to be punished.''

In a civil lawsuit in state court, Mr. Spitzer asked that the landlord, Anthony Manganiello, evict his tenant, Sonia Bryan, who was convicted in 1997 of criminal possession of marijuana. In undercover operations since then, the police have confiscated large quantities of marijuana from Ms. Bryan's Mount Vernon apartment, Mr. Spitzer said. The lawsuit also demands that Mr. Manganiello evict other such tenants. Stacy Albin (NYT)

VTo the Editor: ''Justices Rule Drug-Eviction Law Is Fair'' (news article, March 27) quotes a lawyer suggesting that this country has made no progress in reducing illegal drug use over the last 20 years. I beg to differ. Fifteen years ago, the country's biggest drug problem was cocaine. That's been cut by more than three-quarters. According to a continuing study commissioned by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the number of high school seniors reporting that they've used illegal drugs has dropped by nearly 18 percent over the last 20 years. Those saying they've used marijuana declined nearly 18 percent, and the percentage saying they've used cocaine has been cut by nearly half.

VMarion S. Barry Jr., who since 1975 has served four terms as mayor of the District of Columbia and several terms as a city councilman, said today that he would end his latest run for the Council ''in the overall best interest of my family, this city and its residents.'' Mr. Barry surprised the city's residents and others on March 6 when he announced that he would run for an at-large seat, saying the city's poor and older citizens needed to be better represented.

VA judge declared a mistrial in a lawsuit against Bridgestone/Firestone, saying its lawyer misstated the role of marijuana in a Ford Explorer rollover crash that plaintiffs say was caused by a faulty tire. Judge Craig Estlinbaum of Matagorda County District Court scheduled an April 15 hearing to discuss possible sanctions against the tire maker's lawyer, Morgan Copeland, and to set a new trial date. The plaintiffs say Mr. Copeland implied that the driver at the time of the accident had alone consumed a quantity of marijuana that was in fact shared with two passengers.

VThe New York Fire Department alerted firefighters yesterday that it planned to begin strictly enforcing the department's zero tolerance policy on the use of illegal drugs, and would dismiss those who failed drug tests, department officials said. Fire officials described the effort as a precautionary measure and said they did not believe drug abuse within the agency was widespread. But some in the department have said they worry that firefighters may resort to drug or alcohol abuse to cope with the devastating loss of 343 of their colleagues in the terrorist attack of Sept. 11.

They will also know whether Mr. No. 1 Pick has a police record. They will know how many pounds he can bench-press and whether he wilts under the weight of multiple-choice questions. They will be familiar with the scars on his body and the skeletons from his past. They will have videotape of every second of every game he played last fall, with the best and worst moments condensed into a minidocumentary. They will know if he practices hard, if his parents are divorced, if he eats too much fast food.

VThe National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws Foundation said yesterday that it was beginning a $500,000 advertising campaign featuring Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg paired with a remark he made praising marijuana to a magazine reporter last year before he announced he was running for mayor. The group, which is based in Washington, put out a news release saying that its campaign, which would include bus shelter signs, transit signs and radio advertisements, would be aimed at the city government, which it would like to stop arresting and jailing people for smoking marijuana. The group also placed a full-page advertisement today in The New York Times.

VSusan Gallagher received another e-mail message two weeks ago from the lawyer for the Salesians, the Roman Catholic order of the priest who had sexually abused her and two of her brothers in New Jersey and New York more than 20 years ago. It read like many others the order had sent her. The lawyer, Richard Beran, wrote that the Salesians had taken all necessary steps to keep the priest, the Rev. Frank Nugent, now 80, away from children. That the Salesians would report clerical abuse in Massachusetts, where Father Nugent had also worked, when and if the state passed a law requiring it. And no, he said in response to a request from Ms. Gallagher, the Salesians would not release her from the confidentiality agreement that went with the $250,000 settlement they paid her in 1998.

VA judge is threatening to jail and fine lawyers for Bridgestone/Firestone for causing a mistrial last week in a quadriplegic's suit against the company. The lawyers, from the Houston firm Vinson & Elkins, violated a court order barring mention of the plaintiff's marijuana use. The judge, Craig Estlinbaum of Matagorda County District Court, ordered the lawyers to show why they should not be held in contempt of court, jailed for up to six months and fined $500 each.

VA proposal to require criminal background checks for low-level workers at airports in New York and New Jersey drew a cautiously positive response from lawmakers in both states today, though some said they worried it might hurt businesses already suffering from the drop in tourism. The proposed law is part of an ambitious airport security improvement program unveiled today by Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey. The plan also includes using fingerprint scanners to screen all airport employees in secure areas and installing better surveillance equipment at airfields.

VThe year was 1974 and I had just turned 16. The sexual revolution, Nixon's resignation and marijuana filled the air with new possibilities. I was about to enter my junior year at the academically elite Stuyvesant High. My school uniform was a used Army jacket, a beat-up brown cowboy hat and shoulder-length hair. The previous term, I had dozed through English grammar as the teacher -- soon to retire, nose red, gray hair flowing out of his ear (teenagers fixate on such things) -- diagrammed sentence after sentence day after day. It was the most boring class I had ever taken. So when, junior year, we were permitted to select one elective, I jumped at the chance to take creative writing.

VWALKING on the Lower East Side of Manhattan six years ago, Tom Fruin noticed a yellow plastic drug baggie. Curious, he picked it up, thinking that as an artist he could do something with it. He did. Over the next 18 months, Mr. Fruin, 27, who lives in Brooklyn, collected almost 3,000 drug bags from around the city. They were plastic or glassine, some clear, others solid-colored or patterned, and they ranged from pinkie-nail-size crack bags to credit-card-size marijuana packets. He sewed them together into a quilt that sold for $20,000.

VGilman Louie is one of the most successful computer-game developers of all time. ''I'm your classic entrepreneur,'' he told me recently. ''I started my first business with my fraternity brothers at San Francisco State.'' Louie, an amateur fighter pilot, had his first big success in 1987 with a game called Falcon, which allowed players to simulate the flight of an F-16. Falcon sold millions of copies, not only to teenage boys but also to pilots in the United States Air Force, who found it so realistic that it helped them learn to fly real fighter jets. Louie's biggest success came in 1988, when he imported from the Soviet Union an unexpectedly addictive game called Tetris, which became the best-selling computer game ever. ''Between Nintendo sales and PC sales, 70 or 80 million copies of that game sold,'' Louie says. ''We even found out that Hillary Clinton loved playing Tetris on the Game Boy.'' Lots of companies were impressed by Louie's success, including Hasbro, which put him in charge of creating its games Web site. And then in 1998, Louie was recruited by an even more powerful employer: the Central Intelligence Agency. ''The C.I.A. actually thought that my computer-game background was a valuable asset,'' Louie recalls. ''I look at the world as one big system -- one big game.''

VThe two men accused of the Carnegie Deli murders last year will have two juries sitting in one courtroom for their separate trials, a State Supreme Court justice said yesterday. The men, Andre Smith, 31, and Sean Salley, 29, are each charged with multiple counts of murder, attempted murder and robbery in the shooting deaths in an apartment above the Midtown delicatessen last May. They are being tried separately because each says the other committed the killings. Both juries will sit in the courtroom. When testimony is not relevant to one case, its jury will leave. Defense lawyers expressed concern about the potential for confusion. Susan Saulny (NYT)

The settlement between the doctor, Phillip Leveque, 79, and the Board of Medical Examiners will probably be approved by the 11-member board by Friday, said Dr. Marcia Darm, its chairwoman. A law enacted in 1998 allows patients with debilitating diseases like cancer and glaucoma to grow and use marijuana. Matthew Preusch (NYT)

Mr. Iler is charged with second-degree robbery along with Michael Cournede, 20, and Alban Selimaj, 17, for taking $40 by force from two 16-year-olds outside an Upper East Side delicatessen early in the morning on July 4 last year, according to the authorities. Mr. Iler pleaded not guilty at his arraignment and was released on $2,500 bail.

VThe young men lived within a few blocks of one another in a Muslim pocket in this small town near Birmingham. They were out of school and often on the streets, in the occasional fight, sometime smokers of marijuana. They were, in the slang of the British Midlands, ''dossers'' -- slackers, layabouts. So when they renounced the street for Islam, gave up their bad habits for prayer, their parents -- immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh -- were pleased. Neighbors were bemused: the drifters had found faith.

Mr. Iler, 17, who had a bag of marijuana and a pipe that was still hot in his pocket at the time of his arrest, had been charged with two counts of second-degree robbery, a felony that could have carried up to 15 years in prison with a conviction. Mr. Iler and three other young men were accused of taking $40 by force from two 16-year-olds on a York Avenue corner.

''Dealers,'' an aide warned. The candidate plowed ahead, extended a hand, and plunged into his standard riff on crime, punishment and redemption. Eyes rolled and one man walked away, but Mr. Booker pressed on. ''Four generations ago, black men like us were enslaved,'' he said, his oratory part Cotton Belt preacher, part New Age prophet. ''Now a third of us are behind bars or on probation. It shouldn't have to be that way.''

The outline of what happened next, in a case that could lead to New York's first execution in nearly 40 years, was largely admitted by the defense at Mr. Harris's trial.

VLast week an Illinois state commission charged with examining the fairness of the death penalty released its findings. The commission, composed of 14 prominent citizens -- including nine present or former prosecutors -- recommended more than 80 changes designed to ensure that the death penalty is administered in a just fashion. A slight majority of the commission also declared themselves in favor of abolishing the death penalty entirely. These recommendations say a lot about the criminal justice system -- the whole system, not just capital punishment. The death penalty has always galvanized public sentiment. And just as horrific crimes have brought cries for justice through death, so the exoneration of death row inmates has become a rallying point for opponents of capital punishment.

VTiny has always been just that. He's 14 years old and about four feet tall. His gray Levi's hang off him despite the belt he wears wrapped around his waist twice. He looks about 8, and no one would suspect him of inflicting harm. That's one of the reasons Tiny -- as his street name is translated -- makes an effective assassin. I met Tiny one afternoon not long ago in Medelln, Colombia. He strutted up to me on the street and stood on his toes to kiss my cheek. Then he handed me two warm Chiclets. I had come to Colombia to report on a legal loophole in its Minor's Code that allows kids under 18 to kill without being held responsible. After weeks of trying to persuade gang bosses to let me spend time with their young charges, I was finally introduced to Tiny, who told me his story over the next six weeks.

The 57-to-3 vote represented a rather abrupt about-face for the Republican majority in the Senate, which had opposed the measure. And even today, Republican senators were blunt about their misgivings and the political considerations behind the vote. They also stressed that there was little chance that the constitutional amendment they endorsed today would come to pass, because it is opposed by the Democratic majority in the Assembly.

VFour University of Colorado football players surrendered to the Boulder police yesterday to face arrest warrants on charges of giving alcohol and marijuana to minors at a party where a woman said she was gang-raped. Boulder County's district attorney, Mary Keenan, announced last week that she would not pursue rape charges because of problems with acquaintance-rape cases. But the police said at the time that other charges would probably be filed.

VA Long Island woman was arrested Thursday and charged with being the host of a teenager's overnight birthday party that, the police say, featured alcohol, marijuana and a lap dance by a nude 14-year old girl. The Suffolk County police said that the woman, Lisa G. Brenzel, 43, held the party last Saturday for a friend, a 17-year-old boy identified only as Nicholas, at her home in East Northport. About 14 youths aged 13 to 18 attended, and 8 stayed overnight, the police said. None were related to her.

VA February shooting spree in which a 16-year-old boy is accused of killing six people in two South Jersey towns was motivated by an argument with a neighbor, prosecutors said yesterday. The killings continued, they said, as the boy tried to eliminate potential witnesses. While the boy, Llewelyn James, was arraigned yesterday in Superior Court in Camden, prosecutors provided the most detailed account yet of how and why they believe the boy methodically gunned down the six, including his aunt, in a 48-hour rampage through Winslow Township and Lindenwold on Feb. 4 and 5. Detectives had speculated earlier on the boy's motives, but prosecutors had not spoken publicly on the matter.

VBern may be the capital, Zurich the largest city and Geneva the most international, but Basel can make a fair claim to being the bourgeois-bohemian heart of a new Switzerland that has streamlined its fashion sense and its diet, while loosening up on marijuana and neutrality. With more than 30 museums and dozens of art galleries in a city of only 200,000 people, it is perhaps no surprise that the chic Italian- and French-influenced restaurants that are springing up around Basel seem to be filled with black-clad curators. (The diners may actually work for Novartis or Roche, the giant pharmaceutical companies based in Basel, but the city has a long tradition of mixing business with art patronage.)

VPeggy's group home is in Oakland, near Pittsburgh, where I spent every possible moment when I was 16 and 17. Driving through the streets now, I'm flooded with memories of tooling around in Mom's car, stoned and giggling with friends. I pass the site of the ''O,'' where we got fries and root beer, and the Carnegie Museum, where I took Saturday art classes, and Western Psych, where Peggy was hospitalized 35 years ago, when we still thought she'd recover from paranoid schizophrenia. At the group home, Peggy is waiting outside, smoking. Her hair is short and streaked, a good cut for her. Quick hug. The cigarette slides from her fingers to the sidewalk. I pick it up, put it out and follow her inside. Her gait is jerky. She leads with her toes and slaps her soles down flat -- which is how she has walked ever since she jumped from a five-story window when she was 26. She is 56 now and has been in group homes for 10 years. Before that, she spent 11 years in a state mental hospital, staring blankly and erupting into rages. She'd accuse me of invading her mind with telepathy or would call and say: ''Did you murder Frank? Did you hide him in the attic? I know you did! Don't lie to me, Barbie!'' She's doing better these days. Her hallucinations have quieted. And when she has them, she can usually tell that they're not real.

VDown Roseland Down is the direction of the earth, and the metal supergroup of the same name feels the gravitational pull. Down's song lyrics make references to the earth as a burial ground, a layered museum of older civilizations, a place to grow hallucinogens. The idea of the underground is somewhere in there, too.

VIn hindsight, the tiny changes people saw in Lucas J. Helder's behavior still do not seem to add up to danger. Last month at home in Pine Island, Minn., for his mother's birthday, Mr. Helder, a lapsed Roman Catholic who often annoyed friends with his pronouncements about God and the government, surprised his family by asking for a Bible and spending an hour poring over its pages. Roses arrived the next day with a card noting that although his father usually bought the flowers and signed his name, this time Mr. Helder had handled it all by himself.

VOne man says he was not even there on the evening last May when three people were killed and two others wounded during a botched robbery of a marijuana dealer in an apartment above the Carnegie Delicatessen. The other man says he was forced to join the robbery and killed only one person, by accident. The prosecutors say both men are lying. Those were the competing claims yesterday in separate trials before two juries in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, with the jurors shuttling in and out of the same courtroom to hear testimony and arguments relevant to their cases. In hours of back-to-back opening statements and testimony, the clinical details about the bloodbath in the Midtown Manhattan apartment on May 10, 2001, drew shrieks from the victims' relatives and friends in the back rows.

VThe voice on the recording sounding shaky, frightened and desperate: ''A bunch of us have been shot!'' a man screamed. ''I'm bleeding out of the side of my head and I'm losing a lot of blood. Please, God!'' he cried, later adding: ''They came in, they broke in and they had guns.'' ''Hurry please,'' the man, Anthony Veader, said, the pace of his voice changing from an avalanche of words to something slower, like a prayer. ''Hurry up.''

VThe judge bought marijuana by mail. He paid with a cashier's check, and he used the office stationery. The envelope bore a handsome imprint: ''Philip Marquardt, Superior Court Judge, Phoenix, Arizona.'' Mr. Marquardt lost that job and his license to practice law after his second marijuana conviction, in 1991, and he is today a retired ski instructor in Carefree, just north of here. Now, two men he sentenced to death in the 1980's are asking courts to look into whether his use of marijuana deprived them of a fair trial.

VAt the parole office on West 40th Street in Manhattan, Tuesdays are always busy. Parolees begin lining up on the sidewalk at 8 a.m., 20 minutes before the front door opens. By 8:30, most of the 80 seats in the waiting room are filled. Men greet each other by slapping palms, and the noise level rises throughout the morning. ''A criminal social club,'' a supervisor mutters, surveying the scene with a 9-millimeter pistol hidden beneath his jacket. One Tuesday afternoon, John Scott, a 37-year-old former drug dealer, walked into the waiting room to check in with his parole officer. Tuesday is ''report day'' for parolees assigned to Manhattan III, the parole bureau covering West Harlem and Washington Heights, and Scott was living with his mother in her fourth-story apartment in West Harlem. He left Attica prison 58 days earlier.

VState prosecutors concluded their case against Michael C. Skakel today by playing an audiotape in which Mr. Skakel vividly recounted his activities on the night that Martha Moxley was bludgeoned to death in 1975. On the tape, Mr. Skakel said he was in a tree on the Moxley property that night but then ran home, afraid of the dark. The recording, of Mr. Skakel speaking to the ghostwriter of an autobiography he had once planned to write, offered jurors a chance to hear Mr. Skakel describe his behavior in his own voice, though without any cross-examination. On the tape, Mr. Skakel did not outright deny killing Miss Moxley, but he expressed surprise at her death and fear that he would be accused of the crime.

VA cousin and a brother of Michael C. Skakel testified today that he was with them watching television at the cousin's house in northern Greenwich, about a 20-minute drive from where Martha Moxley was bludgeoned to death, at the time the defense has suggested the killing occurred. The cousin, James Dowdle, and the brother, Rushton Skakel Jr., were the first two witnesses called as the defense began its case today in Michael Skakel's murder trial. They said they were with Mr. Skakel and a third brother, John, watching ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' from 10 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on Oct. 30, 1975.

VThe surest way to know this town is humming is to hear its rhythms, tapped out by shuffled cards, rolling dice and clattering chips. Another sound is the squeaky wheels of housekeeping carts as armies of workers push them up and down long corridors of outsized hotels. For now, the carts are rolling, a sure sign that life is normal in a town swelled by seekers of fun and fortune. But that might not be the case in 10 days, and that has Las Vegas on edge.

VJerry Colangelo, the owner of the Phoenix Suns, has watched with interest as Jason Kidd, the point guard he traded last June, has taken the Nets to the Eastern Conference finals. Colangelo said Kidd's change of scenery helped create the environment for his success this season. But Colangelo said he was not upset about his role in precipitating the change, or about the role of his friend Rod Thorn, the Nets' president and general manager, who traded Stephon Marbury to Phoenix in the deal.

VWhether marijuana can be used for medicinal purposes in California and several other Western states is about to be decided by a federal appeals court in San Francisco. The court is to rule on a challenge by doctors to a federal policy prohibiting them from recommending medical marijuana. The federal campaign, which is designed to block a California state referendum on the issue, is mean-spirited and unconstitutional. The appeals court should not delay in calling an end to it. In 1996 California's voters adopted Proposition 215, also known as the Medical Marijuana Initiative, which holds that the state's criminal laws against marijuana do not apply to seriously ill patients who use the drug on the advice of their physicians. Shortly after it passed, the federal government announced that, as part of the war on drugs, it would use its authority under the Controlled Substances Act to revoke a doctor's license to prescribe drugs if he or she recommended marijuana to a patient.

VMay is the season not only for commencements but also for reunions. And just as commencements are a time to look forward, reunions are a time to look back. My undergraduate classmates and I did that at our 50th reunion at the University of Pennsylvania a few days ago. What a momentous half-century this has been. In 1952, cold war tension was in the air, and many of us faced the draft. There were not many who foresaw that today the Soviet Union would be no more, China would be toying with free markets and South Korea -- then a war zone -- would be an advanced industrial nation.

VIT'S the time of year when New Jerseyans learn far more than they want to about their neighbors, thanks to that great late-spring tradition, the garage sale. Why, exactly, do the Johnsons have 16 slightly used flea collars to sell even though they have never owned a pet? What are we to make of the well-thumbed copy of ''Marijuana Hydroponics'' being offered by the Wilkersons? From there it's a short step to wondering what kind of face New Jersey is presenting to the rest of the world in the international garage sale, the online auction site eBay.com. After exhaustive research involving literally dozens of minutes in front of my computer, I have arrived at this conclusion: We are a bunch of sports-addicted, rat- and deer-hating postcard writers.

VEACH evening, after Judge John F. Kavanewsky Jr. calls the nightly recess, Dorthy Moxley leaves the courtroom where Michael C. Skakel is on trial for murdering her daughter, Martha, and heads out back to the courthouse parking lot. Many days she stops to talk to the large encampment of reporters and television crews. Some days she leaves quietly. But when Mrs. Moxley, who turns 70 next month, climbs into her car, a champagne-colored Mercedes sedan, she gets behind the wheel. On I-95, as on the road to justice, Dorthy Moxley does the driving herself. In the nearly 27 years since 15-year-old Martha Moxley was bludgeoned to death outside her family's home in Greenwich, her mother, Dorthy, has emerged as the single most compelling figure in a case that has generated international attention amid an unseemly swirl of mystery, wealth and celebrity. Through decades of wrong turns, dead-ends and long stalls in the investigation, and more recent delays in getting to trial, Mrs. Moxley has been steadfast, reminding the world, as she said again in the courthouse parking lot last week: ''This is about my daughter.''

VManhattan residents drank more alcohol and smoked more tobacco and marijuana after the Sept. 11 attack, researchers say. The researchers, at the New York Academy of Medicine, surveyed nearly 1,000 residents in the two months after Sept. 11. A quarter of respondents said they drank more than usual in the five to eight weeks after the attack on the World Trade Center; nearly 10 percent said they had been smoking more cigarettes and more than 3 percent said they had been smoking more marijuana.

VFour men were arrested in Upper Manhattan yesterday, accused of shouting racial epithets and smashing the windshield and side mirror of a car belonging to an interracial couple on Monday night, the police said. No injuries were reported. The Police Department's Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the incident, which was directed against a white man and a black woman, whose names were not released. Two brothers from Dobbs Ferry, C. J. O'Sullivan, 21, and Robert O'Sullivan, 22, face charges that include resisting arrest, the police said. The two others are Chris O'Neill, 20, and Mark Fanelli, 19, both of Yonkers, the police said. Mr. Fanelli was charged with criminal possession of marijuana. Al Baker (NYT)

VSeeking to bolster Michael C. Skakel's alibi for the night Martha Moxley was bludgeoned to death, the defense today called as its final witness a forensics expert who testified that Miss Moxley died about 10 p.m. on Oct. 30, 1975. That, other defense witnesses say, would put the time of the killing at precisely when Mr. Skakel was miles from the murder scene, watching television at a cousin's home. Testimony by the forensic pathologist, Joseph A. Jachimczyk, who was hired by the Greenwich Police Department in 1976 to help with the investigation, ended four days of defense presentations intended to refute the state's contention that Mr. Skakel, 41, who is a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, killed Miss Moxley with a golf club outside her family's home in the gated Belle Haven section of Greenwich. Both Miss Moxley and Mr. Skakel were 15 at the time. Mr. Skakel, now on trial as an adult, faces up to life in prison if he is convicted.

VB. B. King The difference between the way a songwriter hears her songs and the sound radio stations supposedly want was abundantly clear when Tweet performed on Sunday night at B. B. King in Manhattan. Tweet (the stage name of Charlene Keys) has a hit with ''Oops (Oh My),'' a cheerful song about ''feeling so good I had to touch myself'' that has an ingenious hooting hip-hop track. Yet most of her album ''Southern Hummingbird'' (the Goldmind Inc./Elektra) is filled with softly swaying ballads that dissolve into cooing makeout music. Onstage, Tweet showed where they connect: through Southern soul music, one step removed from gospel.

VInvestigators arrested two men and seized about $1.5 million worth of high-grade marijuana early yesterday morning during a raid on a Tudor-style house in Douglaston Manor, Queens, the authorities said. The men, Vincent Sansone, 32, and Robert Diaz, 34, have been charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, prosecutors said. Both were awaiting arraignment last night and could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Detectives also recovered $1,200 in cash, high-powered heat lamps and other equipment. Jacob H.

V''See that?'' says Harvey Johnson, pointing to a photograph on the wall of his restaurant, Captain Runaground, in Key West, Fla. ''That was the catch we used to get in these waters.'' The picture features a 40-foot boat and what appear to be hundreds of bales of marijuana. ''In the 70's, whoo, we got that all the time, but Nancy Reagan pretty much put a stop to it when she brought in the military. Now we worry about refugees,'' he says, handing Red and me glasses of julep with fresh mint. We are here to go deep-sea fishing and cook up the catch, and Harvey's company is supplying the yacht, the captain and the mate. Three 40-foot fishing boats bob in the Caribbean outside. ''They found a couple of bodies floating out there just the other day,'' Harvey says, rubbing his hand through his beard cheerfully. ''Since immigration policy is now 'If they set foot on land, they get to stay,' these guys fill up their cigarette boats and run 'em into the mangroves and everybody jumps out and just takes off haywire. At $8,000 per, and a boat carrying 30 to 40, captain can do pretty well.'' Red shakes her head, less interested in the smuggling of Cubans than in a sign near the bar that reads ''Harvey's Bait Shop and Sushi Bar -- Today's Bait, Tomorrow's Plate.''

VTHE numbers painted a disturbing picture. Drinking among seventh and eighth graders in this middle-class New Jersey suburb was rising as quickly as the head on a freshly poured glass of Budweiser. A survey of 1,300 students in grades five through eight in 1998 and 1999 showed that 44 percent of the seventh graders and 62 percent of eighth graders had tried either beer or hard liquor, as against 28 percent and 37 percent, respectively, only three years earlier. And more than a quarter of the eighth-grade students said they had been drunk at least once, compared with 11 percent of them in the earlier survey.

VIN THE FOOTSTEPS OF MR. KURTZ: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo, by Michela Wrong. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) A foreign correspondent who spent several years in Congo (formerly known as Zaire) recounts the depredations of Mobutu Sese Seko, who during his 32 years as dictator looted the nation of billions while creating ''a parody of a functioning state.'' ''Her firsthand, and first-rate, account'' is filled with ''well-reported anecdotes,'' Ian Fisher wrote in the Book Review last year. ''The details are what give her story its juice.'' In The Graves Are Not Yet Full: Race, Tribe and Power in the Heart of Africa, by Bill Berkeley (Basic Books, $16), another well-traveled journalist argues that the continent's ruinous violence and chaos are fostered by governments that operate like criminal syndicates (the West also deserves much of the blame). Fisher found this ''a smart and broad introduction to the political crisis in Africa.'' P.S., by Helen Schulman. (Bloomsbury, $13.95.) Louise Harrington is a divorced 38-year-old woman who gleefully stumbles into a fairy tale when she is reunited with a high-school boyfriend who has died in an accident and been reincarnated as a dashing 24-year-old dreamboat. Last year our reviewer, Bliss Broyard, called this a ''fresh and funny love story'' about a lonely woman who discovers a new version of herself. THE BOTANY OF DESIRE: A Plant's-Eye View of the World, by Michael Pollan. (Random House, $13.95.) Linking four basic human desires (sweetness, beauty, intoxication and control) with plants that satisfy them (apples, tulips, marijuana and potatoes), the author explores how plant species have thrived over the millenniums by seducing other creatures, including humans. ''Pollan really loves plants,'' Burkhard Bilger said here last year, and ''his prose both shimmers and snaps.'' Two other books reissued in time for gardening season include The Rose's Kiss: A Natural History of Flowers, by Peter Bernhardt (University of Chicago, $16), which in 1999 our reviewer, Verlyn Klinkenborg, called ''an engaging botanical overview of flowers,'' and Anatomy of a Rose: Exploring the Secret Life of Flowers, by Sharman Apt Russell (Perseus, $13). Last year one critic said this ''luminous blend of memoir, botany lesson and history of science'' is ''like a guided walking tour in a field of wildflowers.'' A PERFECT ARRANGEMENT, by Suzanne Berne. (Plume, $13.) In this disturbing tale about the lies, distortions and secrets of a contemporary family, a well-off working couple yield their children to a ''perfect'' nanny who is equally skilled at telling people what they want to hear and at seeing what she wants to see. The result is a ''penetrating, beautifully written novel,'' Elizabeth Graver wrote in these pages in 2001. THE COLLECTED STORIES OF RICHARD YATES. (Picador USA, $16.) Whether they concern suburban housewives, young soldiers on the prowl in Paris, advertising executives or aspiring Hollywood screenwriters, these tales by the author of ''Revolutionary Road'' focus unflinchingly on lives gone sour and human weakness -- mainly self-deception and the dimly understood yearning for more luck, time and opportunity. Last year in the Book Review, Anthony Quinn called this a ''superb collection'' by ''a laureate of romantic loneliness.'' THE SHAPE OF SNAKES, by Minette Walters. (Jove, $7.99.) Haunted by the violent death of a black woman with Tourette's syndrome 20 years earlier, an English schoolteacher recreates the harrowing event with the help of newspaper clippings, police reports and personal letters, and forces her racist neighbors to confront their role in the murder. In 2001 our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, praised the novelist's ''commanding control over her inflammatory material -- and her readers.'' MARTHA PEAKE: A Novel of the American Revolution, by Patrick McGrath. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.95.) This unsettling novel, which unfolds on strikingly different narrative levels, tells of a young man who is summoned by his dying uncle in 19th-century England to hear the story of a hideously deformed smuggler, poet and tormented soul whose daughter emigrated to America and became a martyr of the Revolution. In 2000 our reviewer, Barry Unsworth, found the book uneven but admired its ''rare qualities of power and urgency.'' Scott Veale

Then comes Saturday. Viewers will face a menu of events that appears to have been conjured by beer sponsors desperate to keep people homebound and unsuspecting of competitive nonsports programming like ''BeastMaster'' (WB) ''Morons from Outer Space'' (Showtime) or ''Buying the Cow'' (Starz).

Skakel as a disturbed teenager who bludgeoned Martha Moxley to death in a jealous rage. They also accused him and his family of a 27-year effort to thwart investigators that included destroying evidence and fabricating an alibi. Mr. Skakel's defense lawyer, Michael Sherman, disparaged the state's case as lacking any direct evidence. In his closing, he urged an acquittal, telling jurors that they should feel insulted by the poor quality of witnesses and evidence presented by the state.

VDrug cheats would face a lifetime ban for a second offense under the first universal doping code for sports and a two-year suspension for a first offense. In its draft of the universal code intended to harmonize global efforts to eradicate drug cheats, the World Anti-Doping Agency specified that the use of performance-enhancing substances would be the basis of any violation. Other illegal or banned drugs, like marijuana or heroin, that are not considered performance-enhancing would come under a separate designation with penalties set by individual sports bodies or government authorities.

VThe Democratic majority in the Assembly tried today to break a year-old deadlock with the governor over changing New York's harsh penalties for drug crimes, putting forward a compromise bill that accepts several of the governor's proposals. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said the new proposal represented ''the last, best hope'' for reaching an agreement with Gov. George E. Pataki before the end of the legislative session in two weeks.

VThe trial of a man accused of killing a 7-year-old San Diego girl has turned its focus onto the lifestyle of her parents as the defense tries to lay groundwork for an alternate theory to the crime. With intense cross-examination Wednesday and again today in San Diego Superior Court, the defense lawyer tried to show that the parents, Damon and Brenda van Dam, engaged in such bawdy behavior the night their daughter, Danielle, disappeared that anybody might have abducted the girl and killed her.

VIn testimony that contradicted his videotaped statement to the police, one of the two men accused of shooting five people -- three of whom died -- in an apartment above the Carnegie Delicatessen last year testified yesterday that he was forced at gunpoint into the botched robbery. The defendant, Sean Salley, said that he and Andre Smith, the other defendant in the dual trials being heard simultaneously in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, had planned to ask Jennifer Stahl, who sold drugs out of her apartment above the Midtown delicatessen, for her cast-off marijuana so they could sell it in Newark. Both men were short on money, Mr. Salley testified, and Ms. Stahl, a former actress, agreed to the deal, in which she would take half the profits.

VIn a case that could have a huge impact on child custody rights, the California Supreme Court has ruled that a man who cared for a 6-year-old boy can be considered his parent, even though the man is not the boy's biological father and was never married to the boy's mother. The unanimous ruling, issued on Thursday, followed similar recent rulings in other states, adding weight to what seems to be an expansion of the criteria for being a parent. The California court effectively ruled that biology does not necessarily establish the only claim to parenthood and that, in some cases, parenthood can also be achieved through love and responsible conduct.

VThere was no direct evidence tying Michael C. Skakel to the murder of Martha Moxley. So prosecutors pieced together what they could: an array of circumstantial evidence that included a murder weapon that came from the Skakel home, incriminating statements by the defendant over the years, a witness who said Mr. Skakel had unrequited romantic feelings for Miss Moxley. Individually, these various snippets offered little to the jury. But in a powerful closing argument, the lead prosecutor, Jonathan C. Benedict, sought to present this evidence, and in particular, the conflicting statements by Mr. Skakel, as a road map to a guilty verdict. In interviews, one juror and two alternate jurors said today that Mr. Benedict had succeeded, essentially winning a conviction by knotting it all together.

VNearly 27 years after Martha Moxley was bludgeoned to death with a golf club outside her family's home in a gated enclave of Greenwich, a jury today convicted Michael C. Skakel of her murder, ending a trial clouded by wavering memories that played out amid a swirl of wealth and celebrity. Mr. Skakel, 41, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, faces a sentence of up to life in prison. He and Miss Moxley were 15-year-old friends and neighbors when she died. During the three-and-a-half-week trial, the jury was offered no direct physical evidence tying Mr. Skakel to the crime but heard substantial testimony about incriminating statements and erratic behavior by him over the years.

VPAUL BETTANY flashed his strawberry blond charm as the blithely naked, scene-stealing Geoffrey Chaucer last year in Brian Helgeland's ''Knight's Tale.'' Then he gave a spirited performance as John Nash's devoted, imaginary roommate in Ron Howard's ''Beautiful Mind.'' Now American audiences can see him in his first major role, as a vulnerable, riveting young psychopath in the Scottish director Paul McGuigan's film ''Gangster No. 1,'' which opens in the United States on Friday. ''I got bored seeing gangster films for middle-class boys like myself to sit there going, 'Oh, I wish I was a gangster,' '' the companionable Mr. Bettany said. He had seated his 6-foot-3 frame at a sidewalk cafe in Soho recently and was chain-smoking and drinking a latte with a Coca-Cola chaser. His hair was correctly mussed, his jeans were crisp and his shoes were impossibly white. ''We wanted to make a film about violence that was an antidote to films like 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.' There's nothing that funny about that kind of violence, and I don't really understand the morality of trying to make it more palatable.''

VA suspect in the triple murder above the Carnegie Deli last summer completed nearly two days of testimony yesterday that almost completely reversed statements he gave to the police and prosecutors after his arrest last year. The suspect, Sean Salley, testified in State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday that he lied to the authorities in his statements because he was frightened -- of the other suspect in the case, Andre Smith, and of the detectives investigating the murders. On a police videotape, Mr. Salley said he and Mr. Smith had planned a strong-arm robbery for money and the marijuana sold by one of the victims, Jennifer Stahl, out of her apartment above the deli. In testimony on Friday, Mr. Salley said that Mr. Smith pulled a gun on him as they climbed to the top-floor apartment on May 10, 2001, and that Mr. Smith demanded he take part in a more violent robbery.

Speaking at the 12th annual National Attorneys General meeting, which is attended by top state prosecutors, Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha said the Arellano Flix organization's business holdings also appeared intact.

VWith New York State's legislative session scheduled to end next Thursday, and election-year politics in the air, the Democrat-led Assembly and Gov. George Pataki unveiled separate proposals last week to break the partisan gridlock that has doomed previous efforts at reforming the notoriously harsh Rockefeller-era drug laws. The state is now close to achieving a decent compromise bill. Neither side should let politics-as-usual stand in the way. Yesterday the Republican-controlled State Senate passed a plan by the governor that, while far too timid, is an improvement over the ideas Mr. Pataki has floated in the past. The Assembly, meanwhile, has approved a bill that is more expansive but still defers to the governor's wishes on a number of points. The seeds now exist for a compromise that would significantly expand the use of drug treatment programs as an alternative to incarceration for nonviolent drug offenders. It would also mark a retreat from the tragic 30-year-old policy of imposing egregiously long prison terms for possessing or selling relatively small amounts of drugs. But the governor and the Assembly need to move quickly, or the moment will be lost.

The man, Steven Santos, was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court, where Judge Ellen Coin ordered him held without bail. During the brief proceeding, Mr. Santos, who wore loose-fitting sweat pants and a white T-shirt, whispered several times to his lawyers, who patted him on the back.

VNevadans for Responsible Law Enforcement, a group seeking to liberalize the state's marijuana laws, said its petition drive to put a constitutional amendment about the issue on the November ballot was going well, but declined to say how many signatures it had gathered. It needs to submit 61,336 by June 18. The amendment would, among other things, let adults possess three ounces of marijuana, impose a tax on marijuana sales and authorize the Legislature to create a distribution system for medical marijuana. Voters would have to approve the amendment this year and in 2004 for it to become part of the state's Constitution. Mindy Sink (NYT)

VClosing statements began yesterday in the seven-week trials of the two men accused of a triple murder above the Carnegie Deli in May 2001. The prosecutor said for the first time that one of the men, Sean Salley, was the lone gunman. Mr. Salley has admitted shooting one of the victims, Jennifer Stahl; he blamed the shooting of her four guests, two of whom died, on his co-defendant, Andre Smith. Mr. Smith's lawyer, Edna Schwartz, maintained yesterday that Mr. Smith had been wrongly accused, and that he made a false confession under duress. Summations are to continue today, and the jury is expected to begin deliberating on Monday. Susan Saulny (NYT)

VSO far, this year's two most lucrative summer movies concern the perilous adventures of male teenagers, one in contemporary New York and the other long ago in a galaxy far away, struggling with the moral and physical burdens of their special powers. Over the winter, the box office was dominated by two rather similar young men, one at an English boarding school, the other in the meticulously mapped Anglo-Saxon dreamworld of Middle Earth. Together, these four movies, ''Spider-Man,'' 'Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones,'' ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' and ''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,'' have earned more than $1 billion in domestic ticket sales. This is, needless to say, only a partial accounting. It leaves out overseas box office, DVD and video revenues, and the all-important merchandising of action figures, light sabers and round, black-framed eyeglasses. And, of course, none of these movies stands alone: ''Attack of the Clones'' is the fifth installment in a double trilogy that has been unfolding for 25 years; ''Fellowship'' is the first episode in a three-film sequence, the second part of which, ''The Two Towers,'' is to appear in December; and the Harry Potter and Spider-Man pictures have inaugurated franchises likely to carry their juvenile heroes at least to the brink of adulthood.

VRaphael Saadiq has an oatmeal voice. He has siphoned off a little of Stevie Wonder's elasticity, and his sense of rhythm is unfailingly expert, yet the voice remains indistinct. When he multitracks it into a backing chorus, it's big but still bland. Yet he knows how to work with what he's got; his first solo album, ''Instant Vintage'' (Pookie/MCA), is one long demonstration of mind over matter. As a producer and member of the bands Tony! Toni! Tone! and Lucy Pearl, he developed an obsession with 1970's soul styles, and it continues here. He likes loading distracting elements into a track; he loves sweet harmonies and string orchestras. Strangely, Mr. Saadiq can also leave well enough alone.

VA shantytown is swelling on the shores of Lake Ontario, practically in the shadow of Canada's richest banks. The 80 residents have squatted on five acres of undeveloped land that is soaking in mercury and lead. Dogs rummage through garbage. Outhouses donated by charities have a stench. There is no running water, save for a single hose shared by everyone, and no electricity. In the winter, people warm themselves over wood stoves.

The men, Andre Smith and Sean Salley, received their verdicts separately in State Supreme Court in Manhattan after being tried simultaneously in the same courtroom. They showed no emotion as the verdicts were read, and hung their heads low as they were led out of the courtroom.

VLAST week on Saturday night, the rapper Nelly was holding court on the 18th floor of the Ritz-Carlton here at a listening party for his new album. The guests included Fernando Vina, the star second baseman of the St. Louis Cardinals; the wife and children of Mayor Francis Slay (who recently honored Nelly for his contributions to municipal life), and Nelly's mother, Rhonda Mack, who knows all the words to her son's songs. ''I am this city,'' he insisted. Nelly has reduced his life story to a geographical fact: he comes from St. Louis. On the cover of his debut album, ''Country Grammar,'' he posed in front of the famous arch, and on songs like ''St. Louie'' and ''Midwest Swing,'' he pledged allegiance to his hometown. He wears a diamond-encrusted St. Louis Rams medallion, and his extended hip-hop family is called the St. Lunatics. You can hear St. Louis in his music, too: he plays up his homegrown slang and twangy delivery.

VThe vial of heroin lands in my lap, and for a few uncomfortable seconds, as an undercover police officer and a very jittery drug dealer both grope my midriff, I worry someone will panic and go for his gun. The dealer is shouting -- for his money, for us to hurry -- peppering his exhortations with unprintable expressions. He looks no more than 20, with baggy trousers, high-top sneakers and a Baltimore Orioles baseball cap perched at a rakish angle. His grasping fingers, I can't help noticing, are bejeweled, like those of the rap artists one sees on MTV videos.

VJUST as travelers may be getting used to the familiar and ever-more-sensitive metal detectors at airport checkpoints, the Transportation Department is evaluating more sophisticated and exotic equipment to screen the one billion or so people who go through such portals in the United States each year. Contractors, sensing a lucrative new market, have built prototypes of scanning systems that will sense tiny particles of explosives as well as drugs. The sensors can register as little as a nanogram, or one billionth of a gram.

The crowd was made up mainly of middle-aged men and women, self-described former hippies who have grown affluent over the years catering to Provincetown's tourists and summer residents. This night, amid the plentiful food and wine, the topic of conversation was an advance copy of ''Ptown: Art, Sex and Money on the Outer Cape,'' by the local author Peter Manso.

VTwo of the three main arteries to Darryl Kile's heart were 80 to 90 percent blocked at the time of his death, Dr. Edmund Donoghue, Cook County's chief medical examiner, said today. But the exact cause of Kile's death will not be conclusively determined until additional tests are performed. Kile, a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, was found dead Saturday in his hotel room here. He was scheduled to start tonight's game against the Cubs at Wrigley Field.

''It's unfair and ridiculous,'' said McEnroe, a television analyst at Wimbledon. ''Unfortunately, it's not as simple as addressing this one issue. I've been fortunate to have a successful book and now someone who is the mother of my three children is attacking me in this manner.

VA man convicted last week of murder in connection with a triple homicide in an apartment above the Carnegie Deli was indicted yesterday on charges that he assaulted a Riker's Island guard. The man, Sean Salley, 30, is accused of punching Officer Vincent Donovan on May 21, officials said. Officer Donovan fell backward and banged his head on a jail cell's bars, the authorities said. He needed eight staples for the head wound he suffered when he fell. Mr. Salley said he acted in self-defense. He would face up to seven years in prison if convicted on the assault charge. He already faces 25 years to life in prison for each of the three counts of his murder conviction. His murder sentencing is scheduled for July 29. Susan Saulny (NYT)

Corey, a right-hander listed at 6 feet 3 and 210 pounds, was placed on the disabled list before last night's game, which was rained out with the Mets trailing the Atlanta Braves, 2-1, in the third inning. No makeup date was announced.

Tarasco, an outfielder who was called up by the Mets earlier this month, told paramedics who arrived at the hotel that Corey had been smoking marijuana because, he said, he thought it was important the paramedics knew.

VThe Mets still do not know what caused the rookie pitcher Mark Corey to have a seizure in the parking lot of a Queens hotel Wednesday night and say they may never find out. The team announced yesterday that it had received negative results from the tests that Corey, 27, underwent Thursday and Friday. He admitted the next day to a Newsday reporter that he was smoking marijuana before experiencing stomach pain and going into convulsions. Corey, a right-handed reliever, will see a neurologist and have more tests tomorrow. Jim Duquette, the Mets' assistant general manager, said doctors might not find a cause for the seizure. ''I don't know if we'll have a conclusion,'' Duquette said. Corey has said that doctors told him he may have had an anxiety attack.

VMayor Bloomberg may be easier than his predecessor was on jaywalkers and the homeless. He may even have smoked marijuana and enjoyed it. But lest he be chalked up as a laissez-faire flower child of a mayor, there is one position on which he sounds positively Giuliani-like: the mayor likes school uniforms. ''As the parent of two kids who had uniforms, it saves a fortune and it sets a tone,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in an interview this month on WABC-TV. ''I've always thought that there's a reason why you put your football team and your cheerleaders in uniform: because it gets them to focus and builds an esprit de corps, and that's why you should do it for academics, which to me are an awful lot more important than the cheerleading and the football game.''

VOver the last 20 years, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has developed a reputation for being wrong more often than any other federal appeals court. In recent years, in cases involving medical marijuana, assisted suicide, disabilities and more mundane issues, dozens of the court's decisions have been reversed unanimously by the Supreme Court.

VCourt of Appeals for Ninth Circuit, which touched off avalanche of criticism with controversial decision that Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional, has developed reputation for being wrong more often than any other federal appeals court; dozens of its decisions have been reversed unanimously by Supreme Court in recent years, and it may be facing yet another reversal; while court is famously liberal, critics attribute record in Supreme Court more to its unwieldy size than ideology (M)

VSteve Trachsel held his glove to his face, concealing his mouth, but his facial muscles churned as he spoke to the pitching coach Charlie Hough. The Yankees had one out, a run in and men on first and third in the fourth inning last night and were already ahead, 3-0. Hough was trying to coax Trachsel through two more outs. ''I was just battling through it,'' Trachsel said.

VThe muscle spasms at the base of Steve Trachsel's neck did not improve significantly after he received a cortisone shot Sunday, so he will return to New York on Tuesday for more tests. The Mets are unsure if the right-handed Trachsel, one of their best starting pitchers recently, will make his next scheduled start Friday. They have not ruled out placing him on the disabled list. Trachsel did not know how he injured his right trapezius, a large muscle in the upper back. The team said he had muscle spasms. Cortisone is usually used to treat inflammation.

VOmain Gullette seemed to be in the midst of a life conversion, the kind that inspired his friends and family with hope and faith. He had been arrested four times as a teenager and could not stay out of trouble. He was sent by the courts to a special residential school, where he became a determined and forthright student-athlete and the student body president. He accepted a scholarship to play football at Syracuse, and said he was going to become a star in the N.F.L., wealthy enough to buy his mother everything she ever wanted. Lately, he had done everything right, and that was to be his reward.

V'It's a good thing you didn't see me this morning,'' Richard Wallace warns me as he bites into his hamburger. We're sitting in a sports bar near his home in San Francisco, and I can barely hear his soft, husky voice over the jukebox. He wipes his lips clean of ketchup and grins awkwardly. ''Or you'd have seen my backup personality.'' The backup personality: that's Wallace's code name for his manic depression. To keep it in check, he downs a daily cocktail of psychoactive drugs, including Topamax, an anti-epileptic that acts as a mood stabilizer, and Prozac. Marijuana, too -- most afternoons, he'll roll about four or five joints the size of his index finger. The medications work pretty well, but some crisis always comes along to bring the backup personality to the front. This morning, a collection agency for Wallace's college loans wrote to say they'd begun docking $235 from the monthly disability checks he started getting from the government last year, when bipolar disorder was diagnosed. Oh, God, it's happening again, he panicked: His former employers -- the ones who had fired him from a string of universities and colleges -- would be cackling at his misfortune, happy they'd driven him out. Wallace, 41, had raged around the cramped apartment he shares with his wife and son, strewn with computer-science texts and action-doll figurines.

VIN the animated superhero universe, Birdman -- who got his powers from the sun and lived in a volcano with his giant eagle companion, Avenger -- seems an unlikely candidate for rebirth. His show, ''Birdman and the Galaxy Trio,'' lasted for just a year and a half beginning in 1967, and most viewers probably forgot about him 30 years ago. But Birdman had a couple things in his favor. He was a Hanna-Barbera character, and Cartoon Network owns the Hanna-Barbera animation library. And Michael Ouweleen and Erik Richter remembered him.

VIt started with a premonition from a friend who was crazy, though mostly in good ways. She was a storyteller with a hooting laugh, and one afternoon in front of my wife and daughters, she launched into a tale about how she'd once gotten a job when she showed the boss that she could fit her fist in her mouth. When my friend finished her tale, we all realized that my younger daughter, then 5, had her fist all the way inside her mouth. Out of nowhere, the friend said, ''That child is going to be pregnant by the time she's 15.'' I thought of those words the day my friend died. I thought of them again the day I learned that my daughter was pregnant. She was 15. Her older sister is on the dean's list at her university, and she's always so well behaved that I sometimes worry she's too good. Maybe my younger daughter feels she has to carve out her own identity by doing what she pleases. She smokes cigarettes and marijuana and doesn't care who knows. She promises to drop out of school when she turns 16. We used to ground her until she realized that there was no way we could forcibly make her do anything she didn't want to do.

VPOLICE Officer Richard Alaimo of Yonkers thought he had hit the lottery when he was tapped for the department's new bicycle corps four years ago. He liked bike riding because it evoked carefree childhood joy, until it became the daily grind. ''Now, I hate it,'' he said. ''I have a new bike at home; I don't even want to look at it.'' But he jests. Officer Alaimo, 32, zealously patrols Getty Square in Yonkers, the downtown shopping hub that had acquired the nickname Ghetto Square, hammering away at quality-of-life offenses like public urination, noise violations, drug use, drinking and loitering. His steel steed gives him the advantage of stealth, speed, maneuverability and the chance to interact with the public.

The escaped prisoner, Jaime Ramirez, of Saratoga Avenue, Brooklyn, is at least the 15th person to have escaped police custody this year. Mr. Ramirez shoved a detective escorting him into the 88th Precinct station house about 10:20 a.m. Saturday and fled into the G line subway station at Classon and Lafayette Avenues in the Clinton Hill neighborhood, the police said. The police urged anyone with information about the incident to call (800) 577-8477. Al Baker (NYT)

VIn five years in office, the Labor government has been a two-man show, with Gordon Brown, the strong-willed treasurer, exercising power independently of Prime Minister Tony Blair and positioning himself as Mr. Blair's sure successor. Now a third person, David Blunkett, the government's chief law enforcement official, has stepped into the center ring, generating talk of an alternative future prime minister.

VBritain, which has one of the highest rates of cannabis use in Europe, said today that it was relaxing its laws on marijuana smoking, keeping the practice theoretically illegal but making private use in discreet amounts no longer subject to arrest. The decision, announced by Home Secretary David Blunkett in the House of Commons, stirred criticism from the Conservative opposition and some Labor politicians and prompted the country's former antidrug chief to resign as a government adviser because, he said, Britain is ''moving further toward decriminalization than any other country in the world.''

VGuard Jay Williams, the No. 2 pick in the N.B.A. draft, signed a three-year deal with the Chicago Bulls yesterday. Williams, who helped Duke win the national title in 2001, left school after his junior season, when he won the Naismith and Wooden Awards and was a unanimous first team all-American. ''We're ecstatic, it's the culmination to two months of effort on our part and on their part to get it together,'' said Williams's agent, Bill Duffy. The deal, he said, is worth close to $10 million.

VLast year at this time, Allen Iverson sat on the gym floor at the Boys and Girls Club in Newport News, Va., and spoke passionately to the children attending his basketball clinic. James Johnson, the club's executive director, recalled how Iverson, the Philadelphia 76ers' All-Star guard, had told the rapt audience that he had made mistakes before and was not perfect. He had impressed upon the teenagers not to make the same mistakes, Johnson said.

VNot only is Stephen Fry a first-rate comic actor, he is also an accomplished and talented light novelist. His new novel, REVENGE (Random House, $23.95), set between 1980 and the present day, is a retelling of the swashbuckling classic ''The Count of Monte Cristo.'' Dumas's chestnut might not be the greatest novel ever written, but it certainly has one of literature's greatest plots, and Fry takes full advantage of it, using the elements that work and altering the narrative to suit his own thematic purposes. The 17-year-old Ned Maddstone is, at the story's opening, almost disgustingly perfect. The adored only son of an old-school Conservative politician, he is in his last year at Harrow. He is a star cricket player, his school's ''head boy,'' bound for Oxford; newly in love with a beautiful and brilliant girl, he is a powerful focus of envy among his fellows, although he is far too modest and diffident to realize it. Three jealous rivals arrange to have him arrested for marijuana possession. In police custody, he finds himself at the center of a political scheme involving I.R.A. terrorists. A scandal is impending, and a poisonous government agent, to save his own career, arranges for Ned to be spirited away to an insane asylum on a distant Scandinavian island. There he languishes for many a long year. But as readers of Dumas will predict, he eventually makes a dramatic escape, returns to London in disguise and descends on the terrified men responsible for wrecking his life. Fry has worked in any number of clever references to Dumas -- some of the characters' names, for example, are anagrams or near anagrams for their counterparts in ''Monte Cristo'' -- but the book is both a highly readable thriller and a viable novel in its own right. Fry has his own ideas about revenge, ideas that diverge from those of Dumas, and he keeps us guessing right up to the story's unpredictable ending. Brooke Allen

VFOR Justin, a history teacher and the father of two teenagers, the moment of drug anxiety came when his children were in elementary school. They had just been to a DARE drug education class and informed him ''that it's a totally bad thing to take drugs,'' he said. Though he approved of the overall message, their zeal put him in a fix. Justin, 50, who declined to use his last name, smokes marijuana two or three times a week. What could he tell his children without appearing to condone drug use? ''I said, 'But not all drugs are bad, are they?' ''

VI HAD just pulled out of the recreational-vehicle lot and was cruising along a narrow street with my newly rented 24-foot motor home, bearing down on traffic as if I were driving a tractor-trailer. It was intoxicating to peer down on the world from a high cab, to see sports cars shrink from my path, as I rolled along the road with my portable house behind me. Then there was a thump on my right. Or, actually, a huge, gut-churning THUMP! I looked to the right. My side-view mirror, which had stuck a foot out from the cab, now was folded neatly against it. It had decked a sidewalk street sign, which was now quivering with indignation.

VThe New Jersey Supreme Court, citing a trial judge's error, reversed a Camden man's death sentence yesterday, but upheld his conviction for murder. The man, Daron Josephs, now 30, was convicted in April 2000 of murdering two other members of a marijuana-distribution ring in 1995. The unanimous ruling by the seven-member court threw out the death sentence because the judge improperly instructed the jury. Under state law, an accomplice cannot be sentenced to death. Yet the jury was told to consider first whether Mr. Josephs committed the murders directly, and then consider whether he was an accomplice. The high court decision said the jury should have been instructed to consider those issues at the same time, which Mr. Josephs' lawyer argued could have reduced the likelihood of his client receiving the death penalty.

VYOU couldn't make this story up: an African-American high school football and basketball star is convicted of a crime, sentenced to five years in prison. As his final act in office, the nation's first black governor steps in and grants him clemency. The athlete sits out sports for a year as a condition of clemency and receives a scholarship to play basketball at a prestigious university. He becomes an all-American, leaves college after his second season, becomes the first player taken in the N.B.A. draft, is voted rookie of the year and earns millions of dollars. But here's the killer: Ten years after clemency is granted, the player ends up back where he began: behind bars, in police custody.

VDrug use among high school and junior high school students has dropped to its lowest level in eight years despite fears that drugs and alcohol use would rise to deal with added stress after the Sept. 11 attacks, drug policy officials said today. The annual survey, released by the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education, found that the percent of students who used alcohol or tobacco at least once from August to June was the lowest it had been in the 15-year history of the study.

VStudents angered by the death of a youth at police hands clashed with authorities at the University of Nairobi. An official of the Kenya Red Cross Society said at least 17 students and 10 police officers were injured in the fighting, in which students threw stones and officers wielded batons and eventually used tear gas and water cannon. The riots forced closure of all major highways connecting the city center to its western suburbs. The authorities said the police were questioning a group suspected of selling marijuana and shot the student in self-defense when he rushed them with a knife.

VGEORGE and Derek are elated by the success of their new business. ''It's going to take us longer to count it than it did to sell it,'' says Derek (Paul Reubens). He and George (Johnny Depp) are admiring the pile of cash they've amassed selling marijuana to Southern Californians in Ted Demme's BLOW (2001). But is that enough for George? No, he's not going to be a worn-down wage slave like his father (Ray Liotta), so he moves ''up'' to selling Colombian cocaine and marries a gorgeous but cold drug-family princess (Penlope Cruz). Eventually both his work and his wife do him wrong -- Sunday at 10 p.m. and Thursday at 11:35 p.m. on Starz. Tom Grunick (William Hurt) is a golden-boy news anchor, but he knows he doesn't deserve his success. ''What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?'' Tom asks rhetorically. His less glamorous, far more knowledgeable colleague Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) offers a suggestion: ''Keep it to yourself.'' James L. Brooks's BROADCAST NEWS (1987) is a comedy about style versus substance, the stylishness belonging to a rising Washington anchor who looks great on camera but doesn't know the names of all the cabinet posts. Holly Hunter plays the producer who sides with Aaron professionally but may not be able to resist Tom personally. Jack Nicholson is deliciously arrogant as the network anchor visiting from New York -- Saturday at 9 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 2:10 a.m. on WE.

VTHE big scoop in the Canadian news media last week came when a reporter asked Justice Minister Martin Cauchon if he had ever smoked marijuana. ''But of course,'' replied Mr. Cauchon, Canada's top law enforcement officer. ''I'm 39 years old.'' Smiling, he was quick to add that he had given it up.

VTHE TERRITORY OF MEN A Memoir By Joelle Fraser Illustrated. 222 pages. Villard Books. $22.95. When Joelle Fraser was a little girl, she understood that late at night was the time when the grown-ups got in the hot tub. Her favorite aunt and the aunt's friends wore high boots and long coats and dangling jewelry as they inhaled white powder off the kitchen table. Houses smelled like meat and bread and marijuana. ''I was loved,'' Ms. Fraser recalls. ''I had no bedtime. I fell asleep on laps and couches and on piles of coats, and sometimes a dog or another kid slept beside me. I was never alone.''

In a move toward making San Francisco the first city to defy openly the federal ban on growing marijuana for any reason, the Board of Supervisors approved a ballot measure on Monday that would explore growing marijuana on public property as a way around the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration's continual closing of medical marijuana clubs.

VIt is high noon, 102 in the shade, and Andrs Guerra is a blue blur in his wool-blend United States Customs uniform, dashing from car to car at this border crossing from Mexico. Interrogating drivers, flashing his mirror under tailpipes, peering into gas tanks with a fiber-optic probe, tuning in his radiation detector, he is guarding the border as best he can. His recent catches include more than $1 million in illegal cash, a ton of marijuana, 600 pounds of cocaine and three writhing baby alligators hidden under a smuggler's blouse.

VA municipal judge in Philadelphia dropped all the felony charges against Allen Iverson yesterday in connection with an incident earlier this month in which he was accused of breaking into an apartment armed with a gun in search of his wife after a domestic dispute. After a tumultuous six-hour hearing, during which one of Iverson's accusers appeared to contradict information he had previously given to the police, Judge James DeLeon dropped 12 of the 14 counts against Iverson, the Philadelphia 76ers' star, including a weapons charge and accusations of assault, criminal trespassing and criminal conspiracy.

VTwo gunmen convicted of killing three people and wounding two others in an execution-style shooting above the Carnegie Delicatessen in Midtown Manhattan were sentenced to life in prison yesterday. The sentences by Justice Carol Berkman completed an emotional day in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. During the proceedings, prosecutors said they did not believe the two men, Joseph Sean Salley and Andre S. Smith, could ever be rehabilitated, and the victims' relatives recounted their enduring pain and anger.

VNo Relation to the Story Only Hollywood could find glamour in corn. From bundled corn stalks at Alice Tully Hall to corn on the cob at the Metropolitan Club, the opening-night party for M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN'S ''Signs'' was heavy on that pale yellow grain. The centerpieces? Corn. Even the taupe carpeting suggested a late-autumn cornfield. But Mr. Shyamalan, not the corn, was the evening's main course. After all, Newsweek had just splashed his face on the cover and named him the new Spielberg. ''It's like my Mom wrote it, it's so good,'' he said gleefully about the article. The film, which stars MEL GIBSON and JOAQUIN PHOENIX, is a supernatural thriller that features crop circles, creepy kids and alien beings. If not for all the corn, it might have been easier to spot RORY CULKIN and CHERRY JONES, who are in the film, and the other celebrities, including KEVIN BACON, SPIKE LEE, MATTHEW MODINE and BRUCE WILLIS.

VOn the night Lilia Falcon was born 31 years ago, her mother headed north. The Mexican hospital nearest to her family's tiny village meant a trip of 160 miles south over dirt roads. The trip north was half as long. So a boatman ferried her mother across the Rio Grande, and Lilia Falcon entered the world in the hands of an American doctor. The journey might have violated American law, but Ms. Falcon's mother was abiding by the unwritten law of the Big Bend Country, a scarcely populated region of remote desert and jagged mountains named for the abrupt northward turn of the river. For generations, people on both sides have crossed the Rio Grande to shop, to work when work could be found or to share company in a place removed from the outside world.

VRipples from Sept 11 attack in New York and Washington, DC, are being felt as far away as Lajitas, Tex, where Border Patrol, acting in name of domestic security, puts end to unofficial rowboat crossings of Rio Grande by those on Mexican side; unwritten law of Big Bend Country, scarcely populated region of remote desert, has allowed such crossings of Rio Grande for generations; now Border Patrol agents are arresting people attempting to cross, including boatmen; practical effect is that what once was 15-minute trip by rowboat can take six hours to reach region's only official crossing, at Presidio, Tex; many construction workers who have work permits and jobs in US but homes in Mex are now sleeping in tents or trucks, and two dozen children on Mexican side, some American citizens, are cut off from only school; photo; map (M)

Rather than cocaine or Ecstasy, however, these dealers are selling sea turtle eggs, snatched from the nests of endangered species and marketed to people who consider them a delicacy or swear by them as an aphrodisiac.

VAfter voting two years ago to ease state drug laws, Nevada voters could go even further this year, making their state the first to legalize marijuana and derive taxes from a regulated sales system. It is a stunning possibility in a state where possession of more than one ounce of marijuana is still a felony, punishable by up to four years in prison, and possession of less than an ounce remains a misdemeanor that carries a $650 fine.

There were unconfirmed reports of two Palestinians killed in Nablus and a third, a member of Hamas, in a neighboring village. A1 President Bush reacted with outrage to the deaths of the five Americans, telling reporters he was ''furious.'' A1

It was Billy Rogers, campaign manager for the effort, who said: ''This allows law enforcement to go after people who truly act irresponsibly. People who smoke marijuana are otherwise law-abiding citizens who shouldn't be arrested. They are not endangering society.''

VAndrew M. Cuomo called for the outright repeal of mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent, low-level drug offenders yesterday, and took his rivals in the campaign for governor to task for not doing more to roll back the so-called Rockefeller drug laws. At a campaign stop in East Harlem, Mr. Cuomo offered an alternative plan for the sentencing of low-level drug offenders, and accused his Democratic opponent, H. Carl McCall, and Gov. George E. Pataki of failing to change the ''antiquated criminal justice system.'' Mr. Cuomo called the existing laws ''probably the most personal, the most human manifestation'' of Albany's failings.

VDarrell Porter, the All-Star catcher who overcame drug and alcohol addiction to become the most valuable player of the 1982 World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals, was found dead Monday at a park outside Kansas City, Mo. He was 50. The police in the suburb of Sugar Creek said that a motorist had spotted Porter's body near his car, its motor still running, during the late afternoon. Donna Newton, a police dispatch supervisor, said in a telephone interview that the car had become stuck after it was pulled off a roadway and that Porter might have been trying to free it when he collapsed. Temperatures in the Kansas City area were in the high 90's on Monday.

VUnable to land Andre Miller or Baron Davis, the Knicks are turning their attention to the Dallas Mavericks' playmaker, Nick Van Exel. But even though Van Exel is available, some familiar obstacles could hinder the Knicks' ability to bring him to New York. As in their pursuit of Miller, the Knicks may have to involve a third or fourth team in a trade for Van Exel, not because Dallas finds their players undesirable, but because a traditional two-team swap may not benefit the Knicks.

VLast week I turned on CMT -- Country Music Television -- just in time to see Toby Keith perform the controversial hit single from his new album, ''Unleashed.'' It took some talking before he was ready to play. In the grand tradition of country music, he explained that he was a simple man and that this was a simple song and that he didn't much care what the media made of it. The song, ''Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,'' is both a paean to America's military men and women, including Mr. Keith's father, and a promise to kick the rear end of any enemy because ''It's the American way.'' Mr. Keith is a solid slab of a man, a former football player and Oklahoma oilhand. On CMT he wore a flat-crowned, pure-white cowboy hat and a long goatee that was half Buffalo Bill, half buffalo. He struck out into the song, and the audience sang along with him. The music was solemn, almost dirge-like. Imagine, if you can, a cross between the slow part of ''American Pie'' and ''Ballad of the Green Berets.'' If anything, Mr. Keith under-sang the line about where the American boot goes, but the studio audience was having none of it. It shouted and applauded and rang out the words. The mood was one of nostalgic revenge.

VA judge in Oregon City, Ore., rejected the third and final argument prosecutors had made to justify a warrantless search that turned up a bag of marijuana last February at the home of Portland Trail Blazers guard Damon Stoudamire. Clackamas County Circuit Judge John Lowe said in a written opinion that he could find ''no precedent in this state for upholding such a search of a private residence.''

VThe state's largest law enforcement group, the Nevada Conference of Police and Sheriffs, endorsed a ballot initiative to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana, saying passage would give officers more time to investigate violent crime. ''Violent crime is on the rise and terrorism remains a real threat,'' the group's president, Andy Anderson, said. ''Our priorities have changed.'' Polls show that Nevadans are about evenly split on the issue, which would become law if it passed in November and again in 2004. Michael Janofsky (NYT)

VTHE man who called himself Texas Heartbreaker was 6 feet 3 inches and 260 pounds, with hands the size of Texas steaks. Even at 55, he was one of the fiercest-looking bikers at a rest stop on Interstate 90 last Sunday, taking a break on the way across South Dakota. Leaning against his muddied 1969 Harley-Davidson motorcycle, he watched, with simmering disgust, the ''squares,'' as he described them, pulling into the parking lot, towing Harleys.

VA Suffolk County grand jury has declined to indict a police officer who fatally shot a man during a botched drug raid in April. But a lawyer for the dead man's family said yesterday that they would seek damages in a wrongful-death lawsuit. Jose Colon, 20, a graphic arts student, was shot in the head on April 19 as he emerged from a house in Bellport, just as several officers were advancing in a drug raid. According to the police, Officer Tony Gonzalez's drawn 9-millimeter submachine gun accidentally fired when he was bumped from behind by another officer who had tripped on a tree root.

The lake is a centerpiece of Sterling Forest in Orange County, N.Y., where -- from the top of its 65-foot fire tower -- an undulating horizon of treetops is barely perceptibly pierced by the highest slivers of the Manhattan skyline, 35 miles to the south.

VHere is the brick terrace where Tony first saw the fateful ducks in the swimming pool. Here is the ornate living room where Carmela nearly lapsed and started to make out with the family priest. Here is the powder room where A. J. was caught smoking pot on his Confirmation day. And somewhere around this place is the basement where Tony Soprano decided to have Vincent (Big Pussy) Bonpensiero whacked. But wait. These things would have played out here if, in fact, this were the residence of Tony Soprano, the depressive Shakespearean mob boss whose matricidal urges, extramarital affairs and gangster wiles have made the HBO series ''The Sopranos,'' now going into its fourth season, the most successful drama ever broadcast on cable television.

''Right down there, I saw a guy injecting a girl into her neck,'' said James Haind, 28, his indignation wrapped in a cloud of smoke. Hanging out recently at the project's skateboard park with his friends, their skateboards and their stashes of weed, he offered himself as living proof that marijuana does not lead inevitably to harder drugs.

VSix-month experiment in loosening England's national drug laws in Brixton section of South London pleases many marijuana smokers but leaves many other residents feeling that their neighborhood has turned into open-air drug bazaar; partly as result of Brixton's trial, government has announced plans to downgrade criminal penalties for smoking pot in country where estimated five million people are habitual users; plan is acknowledgment that drugs like heroin and cocaine are far more harmful than marijuana, but it gets mixed reviews and raises host of questions about loosening marijuana laws; photos; map (M)

VA front-page article on Monday about the house in North Caldwell, N.J., used to represent the residence of the mobster Tony Soprano in the HBO television series ''The Sopranos'' misstated the given name of Big Pussy, a character killed by Tony. He was Salvatore Bonpensiero, not Vincent. The article also misstated the circumstances in which Tony decided to kill him. The decision was made after he awoke from a dream and later found incriminating evidence in his comrade's home, not during a meeting in Tony's basement. The place where A.J., Tony's son, was caught smoking marijuana was misidentified. It was the garage, not the powder room. The article referred imprecisely to an encounter in the living room between Carmela, Tony's wife, and the family priest. The two seemed on the point of kissing, but did not actually do so.

VIN his Greenwich Village apartment last week, John Waters was wearing a loopy T-shirt ensemble by Yohji Yamamoto and listening to Solomon Burke -- and if there is a more inviting way to spend a hot afternoon in New York City, it would be hard to imagine. He had a thin line of mustache, gum-ball-striped socks and a suntan. Next to Mr. Waters was a small photograph of Mme. Chiang Kai-shek and a slightly larger one of Divine. ''I'm obsessed with her,'' he said, referring to the former of the two divas. ''She lives in New York, so I try to spy on her. I ask her doorman, 'Does she get pu pu platters?' And he of course refuses to answer.''

VLarry Rivers, the irreverent proto-Pop painter and sculptor, jazz saxophonist, writer, poet, teacher and sometime actor and filmmaker, whose partly self-mocking bad-boy persona encapsulated the spirit of a restless era that shook up American art, died on Wednesday at his home in Southampton, N.Y. He was 78. The cause was cancer of the liver, which was diagnosed this spring, his family said.

VThe 18-year-old son of Miami-Dade County's top prosecutor, State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle, was arrested on Thursday on a charge of marijuana possession as he tried to board a flight to Puerto Rico with his mother. Screeners at the Miami airport found a pipe and three grams of suspected marijuana on Justin Rundle, the police said. A spokesman for the state attorney's office said the arrest was a ''private matter.''

VQ: Four years ago, you were elected governor of Minnesota as an independent. In June, you announced that you wouldn't seek re-election. So tell us, who proved the more formidable foe: the elitist left or the religious right? I got more trouble from the religious right. They are much more vocal and organized. I vetoed a bill that would force women to wait 24 hours before getting an abortion. I made an offer to the right wing: ''I'll sign this bill if you make all optional surgical procedures have a 24-hour waiting period, which would include liposuction.'' They were appalled.

VOne library doubles as a laundry room, where a person can clean a month of dirty clothes and pick up a Churchill biography in a single stop. Another shares a roof with a state liquor store -- ''books 'n' booze,'' people call it in jest. The libraries of Stevens County, bounded by the Canadian border, national forests and two large Indian reservations, are among the most remote in the United States. They are also threatened with extinction.

VA neighbor of a 7-year-old who was taken from her suburban bedroom here and left dead by the side of a desert road was convicted today of her murder and kidnapping, the first of several such crimes to capture attention this year. The neighbor, David A. Westerfield, 50, sat impassively today as he listened to the verdict in the death of Danielle van Dam in February. The jury also decided that circumstances of the case could merit a death sentence and will begin deliberating Mr. Westerfield's fate next Wednesday.

VQ: Your song ''John Walker's Blues,'' which likens John Walker Lindh to Jesus, has been denounced in some quarters as unpatriotic. What made you want to write it? The main thing is, I got a 20-year-old son, and he's doing great now, but he's been kind of a hard dog to keep under the porch at times, kind of like I was at 20. Also, I get naturally suspicious when politicians start agreeing with each other as much as they were following Sept. 11. It just occurred to me that we were going to get this kid because we couldn't come up with a body that we could say was Osama bin Laden.

VWhen Tom Osborne coached Nebraska from 1973 to 1997, his program was at times viewed by outsiders as a runaway train. There was running back Lawrence Phillips dragging his girlfriend by her hair down a flight of stairs and defensive lineman Christian Peter being accused of rape. The Cornhuskers under Osborne experienced the highs of winning national championships and the lows of the arrests of numerous players. Today, Osborne, a gracious, soft-spoken Congressman representing Nebraska, must feel a strange sense of vindication as he looks around college football. Accusations of rape, drunken driving and all-around thuggery seem to plague the sport. There are also numerous allegations of cheating, epitomized by the Southeastern Conference, in which 6 of the 12 member schools are either on probation or being charged with unethical behavior.

VWith players poised to strike after tomorrow night's games, negotiators in baseball's labor dispute reached agreement on a steroid-testing program yesterday, the first time the union agreed to any kind of random, unannounced testing for major league players. The steroids agreement, a person familiar with the development said last night, is conditional on the two sides reaching complete agreement on a new labor contract.

''Get the deal done,'' the fan said emphatically. ''You're making me miserable.'' The negotiators for the owners and the players wanted a done deal, but despite their feverish efforts to accomplish their goal and avert a strike that is scheduled to begin after tonight's games, they seemed to be failing.

VA 13-year-old boy took the witness stand today and calmly denied that he and his brother killed their father with a baseball bat last fall. The boy, Alex King, testified a few hours after prosecutors played a tape-recorded statement in which he confessed to the killing to police. But Alex, with choirboy looks and small for his age, told the court that the killing was committed by Ricky Chavis, a family friend and convicted child molester with whom he had been sexually involved.

The owners, Michael and Valerie Corral, were arrested on charges of conspiracy and suspicion of intent to distribute marijuana, Richard Meyer, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency in San Francisco, said. Agents seized three rifles, a shotgun and more than 150 marijuana plants. The raid was a surprise to local authorities, who said the Corrals' farm complied with the state's medical marijuana law.

VFour decades ago, a wave of American draft dodgers fled to Canada rather than fight in Vietnam. Some turned to planting marijuana seeds to make a living and spurred an underground industry that is now booming across British Columbia. Over the last year or so, a new generation of Americans has flocked into western Canada, fleeing the Bush administration's crackdown on the clubs that say they provide marijuana to sick people, particularly in California.

VTrue-life stories of battles with drug addiction, when they don't end in death, have a predictable arc: the hero's fall into degradation, his touch-and-go struggle for a cure, then redemption as a witness for the clean and sober. ''Quitting,'' by the young Beijing director Zhang Yang, which is presented by Sony Picture Classics and opens in New York on Friday, does feature a fallen actor and his parents. They all play themselves, re-enacting the raw story of the son's near-obliteration and the parents' sacrificial devotion.

VA state judge today threw out a $78 million civil fraud judgment against the family investment firm of Bill Simon Jr., the Republican candidate for governor, injecting a spark of life into a campaign that had appeared to be faltering. The judge, James C. Chalfant of Superior Court, set aside a jury decision against Mr. Simon's investment company, William E. Simon & Sons, and awarded the firm $125,000 to cover the costs of fighting the accusations. The jury's decision, made in late July, badly damaged Mr. Simon's campaign to unseat Gov. Gray Davis, who has cited the case in speeches and advertisements as evidence that Mr. Simon is unqualified to be governor.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-16 Iraq Causes Rift at U.N. Between U.S. and Others The United States insisted on keeping up the pressure on Iraq with a tough new Security Council resolution, while Russia, France, China and the Arab nations said Iraq's decision to allow the return of international weapons inspectors was enough to hold off stronger action for now. The Bush administration expressed little faith that inspections would ensure Iraq's disarmament, and pressed ahead for a Council measure that could authorize an eventual military attack against Saddam Hussein. A1 U.S. General Arrives in Qatar The commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, Gen. Tommy R. Franks, arrived in Qatar for talks about the rapidly expanding American military presence there, which is expected to play a key role in a war against Iraq. A19

VJames Cohan Gallery 41 West 57th Street, Manhattan Through Oct. 19 In 1987, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art did a kooky thing. In the middle of an intensely materialist decade, when theory-intensive ''commodity art'' reigned, it produced an exhibition titled ''The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting 1890-1985.'' New York didn't want to know from the show, which traveled no farther east than Chicago. Maybe we're catching up with it now.

A1 President Bush lobbied President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to support American action against Saddam Hussein, but the Kremlin said that Mr. Putin resisted the pressure and that his priority remained sending United Nations weapons inspectors back to Iraq.

Like the one about the Mets scout, while looking for talent, leaving no stoner unturned. And you know, no one can ever say the Mets aren't hungry to win, because they've always got the munchies. The Mets don't spread the word, they spread the herb.

VNine days from the end of an underachieving season, the Mets closed ranks yesterday in the face of another embarrassing development. After failing in every way possible to attach on-field success to last winter's highly touted reshuffling of the roster, the Mets are finishing out the season responding to allegations of widespread drug use on the team. Mets General Manager Steve Phillips denied that the team or its minor league system was plagued by marijuana use. He was responding to an article in Newsday yesterday that said at least seven players were using marijuana, and Phillips held up the farm system as a model organization.

VNine years ago, when Vince Coleman threw a firecracker at fans, Bret Saberhagen squirted reporters with bleach and the Mets lost 103 games, Fred Wilpon told the players how he felt. Wilpon, the team's former co-owner and now sole owner, has been humbled by another disappointing season, but he does not feel it is necessary to address the players again. ''This isn't even close,'' Wilpon said yesterday. ''We have been through times that have been much different than this.''

VIn November, voters in South Dakota will decide whether to give tax protesters, medical marijuana users and other criminal defendants a new right. A proposed constitutional amendment would allow defendants there to concede their guilt but nonetheless argue for acquittal on the grounds that the law under which they were charged is misguided or draconian. The South Dakota initiative, known as Amendment A, is the next step in a centuries-old debate about the role of juries in deciding not just the facts of a case but also the wisdom of the law in question. The shorthand term for the complex subject is jury nullification.

VProposed constitutional amendment in South Dakota would allow defendants there to concede their guilt but argue for acquittal on grounds that law under which they were charged is misguided or draconian; initiative, known as Amendment A, is next step in centuries-old debate about role of juries in deciding not just facts of case but also wisdom of law in question; shorthand term for subject is jury nullification; proponents of amendment say it is necessary countermeasure; amendment's chief proponent is Libertarian candidate for attorney general Bob Newland; he opposes what he sees as increasing criminalization of more and more behavior, of things that merely annoy other people; cites recent case of man convicted of cruelty to animals for using his cane to fend off attacking dog, and parents convicted of child pornography for taking pictures of their toddler in tub; South Dakota Bar Assn opposes initiative; much of Newland's support in South Dakota comes from libertarian right; elsewhere, some liberal academics say nullification may be sort of civil right; earlier efforts to pass jury nullification laws in Oklahoma and Arizona failed; lawyers say case that prompted South Dakota initiative was that of Matthew Ducheneaux, quadriplegic convicted for smoking marijuana to alleviate leg spasms after auto accident; photo (M)

VEverything's up to date in New York City. The Yankees win another division championship, and the Mets plunge into another embarrassing situation. The Mets just cannot win, whether it is on the field or off. Marijuana, a 15-game home losing streak, Bret Saberhagen and bleach, a 12-game losing streak, Vince Coleman and a firecracker, last place, Dwight Gooden and cocaine. Mix and match. The Mets have done them all. An entire platoon of Madison Avenue image makers could do no better right now than all the king's horses and all the king's men.

VHow many people are in Bone Thugs-n-Harmony? On Tuesday night the answer depended on what time it was. At 11:30, when the group took the stage at the B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, there were four members. Forty-five minutes later the quartet had been reduced to a trio, permanently it seemed. In the mid-1990's, when virtually all popular hip-hop acts were from California, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony waved a flag for Cleveland. More important, the group's style was both unusual and unexpectedly influential. The members croon their lyrics instead of speaking them, creating songs that are slick, sprightly and tuneful.

VShortly before the start of Sunday afternoon's game against the Montreal Expos, with only a handful of fans in the Shea Stadium seats, the Mets lined up their minor league standouts at home plate. In a season that has been a lost cause on and off the field, when even the Mets' minor leaguers have been linked to the recent uproar about marijuana use, the Mets were allowing themselves a moment of hope. These were the Doubleday award winners from each of the team's minor league affiliates. After they were introduced to polite applause, shortstop Jos Reyes was honored as the player of the year in the Mets' system.

A judge agreed on Monday to allow Justin Robert Rundle, 18, to enter a program under which the misdemeanor possession charge will be dropped if he completes classes and community service. He is the son of the state attorney, Katherine Fernandez Rundle.

VSARA BENNETT had a tremendous victory in court two weeks ago: Lamont Branch, a Brooklyn man who spent 13 years in prison for the murder of a drug dealer, was freed after his brother Lorenzo admitted that he, and not Lamont, had played a part in the killing. The client -- and Ms. Bennett does not dispute this -- had been a young man of the type characterized as Not a Choirboy. There was an arrest on a weapons charge, a job packaging marijuana, but this is how it goes in criminal law. Speaking of her victory, Ms. Bennett, a Legal Aid lawyer, says it went beyond anything she envisioned: not only did Lorenzo testify, but witnesses also recanted and the forensic evidence ''fell apart.''

VThe police said an employee of a KFC franchise was charged with selling marijuana from the drive-up window to customers with the right code word after he gave two bags to a customer who asked for extra biscuits. The surprised customer traded the marijuana in for the biscuits, then called the police. The worker, Carlos Ayala, 26, was carrying a small amount of marijuana, a handgun and about $500 when he was arrested, the authorities said.

VThe Mets and the Pirates had good reason if they did not recognize each other tonight. The last time they met they were opening the season at Shea Stadium, and the Mets were embarking on what they thought would be their path to the World Series. Pittsburgh won two of three games in that series to start a strong April as the Mets showed signs that they might not be as good as advertised. ''We should've known it was going to be a bad year,'' Mo Vaughn said before the Mets squandered a 3-0 lead and lost to the Pirates, 6-3, tonight.

VAfter spending Tuesday night in a jail cell for his arrest on suspicion of bumping a traffic control agent with his Lexus sedan on a downtown Minneapolis street, Minnesota Vikings receiver Randy Moss was charged with two misdemeanor offenses yesterday and released. Moss, 25, who has become almost as well known for his brushes with the law as for his acrobatic catches, was charged with careless driving and failure to obey a traffic officer. Both offenses carry a sentence of up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.

''We were contacted by the Queens D.A. that they might investigate the matter,'' said Jay Horwitz, the Mets' vice president for media relations. ''If they decide to investigate, we'll promise them our full cooperation. Because the case might be investigated, we really can't have any further comment on the situation.''

VThe boos that have accompanied many of Roger Cedeo's actions at Shea Stadium this season have become almost redundant. He knows he has not played nearly as well as he can, and today he said that he would devote this off-season to a better 2003. ''What I'm doing the last month -- and thank God, it's late but not too late -- that memory of as good as I've felt, I want to carry it through this winter and work hard, prepare myself physically and mentally,'' Cedeo said before the Mets' 4-3 loss to the Pirates tonight.

Investigators arrested 45 people, including eight high-level leaders who together put a stranglehold on residents of the Cypress Hills development, a complex of more than 30 buildings, Police Commissioner Raymond W.

VRandy Moss said his palms were sweaty as he stood at a podium at the Minnesota Vikings' practice facility in Eden Prairie, Minn., yesterday and apologized for his actions in a traffic incident in Minneapolis on Tuesday. Moss, the Vikings' leading receiver, spent Tuesday night in jail and was charged Wednesday with two misdemeanors that carry a sentence of up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. Moss is accused of pushing a traffic officer, Amy Zaccardi, a half-block with his car as she tried to stop him from making an illegal turn. The Vikings fined Moss $50,000, and he must undergo a National Football League evaluation. Moss is charged with careless driving and failure to obey a traffic officer, and if he is convicted or enters a guilty plea, disciplinary action by the league will follow. He is scheduled to be arraigned on Wednesday.

VThe lawyer representing Jodi Turner, the woman linked to a published photo showing Mets pitcher Grant Roberts using marijuana, maintained yesterday that she was not guilty of any attempt at extortion. Roberts said last week that the photograph, which was published Sept. 20 by Newsday with an article that stated that at least seven Mets were using marijuana, had been provided to Newsday by a woman he knew in the minor leagues who ''tried to threaten me and do other things, to get me to do stuff and give her things.''

VRandy Moss will be running his routes against the Seattle Seahawks tonight, good news for the Minnesota Vikings and all of us who prefer he express his road rage within the white lines. Last week, Moss, the star receiver, was arrested and jailed after he was charged with pretending that a downtown Minneapolis traffic officer was a cornerback and pushing her along the street with the front of his Lexus until she fell down. What might have landed me in jail for the season was somehow perceived as the justifiable confusion of a man who is only used to heavy traffic when he is trying to catch a football. He was given the equivalent of a pushing penalty, charged with misdemeanors by the law and fined $50,000 by the Vikings. It was probably a good football call; the Vikings have lost all their first three games. Would they do better without their star? But was it a good mental-health call? How will it help Moss reroute his troubled life? How will it affect all his fans who also want to give traffic officers rides on their bumpers?

VWhen Armando Benitez put away the Braves in the ninth inning yesterday and the 37,721 fans at Shea Stadium cheered, the remaining Mets flowed from the dugout. Surrounded by Esix Snead and Ty Wigginton and Marco Scutaro, Benitez handed out high-fives to end the Mets' season. The Mets did not offer any conciliatory speeches before the game and let Fan Appreciation Day stand on its own. All that was missing at the end were the Mets' regulars. Without any starting position players on the field, the Mets' failure of 2002 faded from view with a 6-1 victory over the Braves. Some players had left when the clubhouse doors opened later. Others were already packed, the lockers empty.

VH. Carl McCall did not summon so much as a note of his customary preacherly inflection yesterday, and his jokes were halfhearted as he unveiled his state budget reform plan at a breakfast forum at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers in Manhattan. It was a sharp contrast to the cocksure jubilation that Mr. McCall, the state comptroller and Democratic candidate for governor, displayed Thursday night in the same hotel, when he had a crowd of Democratic supporters, including Al Gore, chanting, ''It's time for Carl McCall.''

VOne day after he was fired as the Mets' manager, Bobby Valentine was not furious, fiery or flippant. He accepted his dismissal by the Mets' owner, Fred Wilpon, as the inevitable result of a misbegotten 75-86 season, the second consecutive year the Mets failed to make the playoffs. ''I think it's fair that I'm not managing the team, because Fred wanted to base that decision on performance,'' Valentine said yesterday during a news conference at his sports bar across Grand Central Parkway from Shea Stadium. ''Our performance was not very good.''

VIn two speeches that broadly promised increases in spending for health care, transportation and low-income housing, Prime Minister Jean Chrtien signaled this week that he planned to leave office with a burst of social activism in the next 16 months. Mr. Chrtien's first policy statements as Parliament reconvened indicated that he hoped to push the governing Liberal Party toward the left after years of spending cuts to trim budget deficits, although specific proposals and spending totals will not be disclosed until the annual budget is presented next year.

VHOMEOWNERS normally depend on contractor crews to work on their homes. Joseph Holtzman, the editor in chief of the idiosyncratic design magazine Nest, which has dwelled equally on Proust's bedroom and Farrah Fawcett memorabilia, took a different approach. He posted want ads at a dozen design schools. The job description was vague: students were needed ''to breathe life into a showpiece house'' located in a rural byway about 20 miles south of Albany, in Ghent, N.Y. No particular skills were required: applicants with enthusiasm and an inclination to debate the deeper implications of stripes versus polka dots were a plus.

McBryde of Forth Worth, had been fighting the federal judicial discipline system since the mid-1990's, when a committee of fellow judges began investigating complaints against him. In 1997, the Judicial Council of the Fifth Judicial Circuit reprimanded him and suspended him from hearing new cases for a year for a pattern of ''intemperate, abusive and intimidating'' treatment of lawyers and other judges.

VChicago Bears wide receiver David Terrell will be out two months after surgery to repair a broken bone in his right foot. Doctors inserted a screw in his foot, and Coach Dick Jauron said the surgery went well. Terrell, the Bears' top pick in the 2001 draft, was hurt on the last play of Monday night's game against Green Bay. He has 9 catches for 127 yards this year, 3 for touchdowns.

VTHE 100-degree days are gone, and so are the lobbyists and politicians who normally snap up tables in Sacramento's best restaurants -- it's campaign season. The winter rains haven't arrived, the Sacramento River cruises are still running, and you can have Old Sacramento, the obligatory visitors' stop, almost to yourself. In Midtown, the quirky shops and small galleries are open, and the flat, quiet streets invite bicycling. You won't get lost, whether walking, biking or driving; in 1848, when thousands of manic gold seekers were debarking from steamboats here for the overland rush to mining country, the new city of Sacramento was laid out in a neat grid, with north-south streets numbered and east-west streets lettered. You can also find something here that California isn't known for: fall color. After a walk down streets shaded by hardwoods, palms and conifers, you'll be ready to believe a hard-to-verify local claim: that Sacramento, with one million trees and 407,000 people, has more trees per capita than any other city in the world.

VThe federal drug czar, John P. Walters, denounced as a ''stupid, insulting con'' a proposition on the state's Nov. 5 ballot that would decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana. Mr. Walters, head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, made the remarks at an appearance with the two major-party candidates for governor, the Democrat Janet Napolitano and the Republican Matt Salmon. If passed, the proposition would decriminalize the possession of up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use. Anyone caught with that amount would be fined $250 for each of the first and second offenses and personal use. Anyone caught with that amount would be fined $250 for each of the first and second offenses and $750 for a third or subsequent offense within two years.

VFor the first time in his three campaigns for governor, George E. Pataki will debate his opponents tomorrow. But he has insisted on including all seven of the candidates actively running, ensuring a cluttered event in which challengers will have a hard time distinguishing themselves. The debate was not put together without a hitch. On Thursday, Mr. Pataki threatened to pull out when the producers at WABC-TV said they wanted to seat him between his two leading opponents, H. Carl McCall and Tom Golisano.

VArtists usually don't live pretty. They arrange their environments primarily to service their work. And in this, Leonora Carrington is no exception. When your mind is peopled with strange beings enacting cryptic and symbolic dramas on imaginary stages that only you can see, it stands to reason that your actual living space is besides the point. Frankly, it was not some pretty place, but rather the pursuit of the marvelous, that sent me down to Mexico City this summer to visit Carrington, who at 85 is one of the last surviving Surrealists. The marvelous, you may recall, is a tenet of Surrealism. It's the juxtaposition of two distantly related images that, when brought together, create such a spark that it is marvelous!

VTHIS week, American Ballet Theater plans to rock out. For the company's City Center season, the artistic director Kevin McKenzie commissioned David Parsons, Ann Reinking, Natalie Weir and Stanton Welch to find inspiration in the music of George Harrison. No concert T-shirts, no lighters, no marijuana. Just the trailing scent of Chanel and ballet patrons, clad in black tie, playing air guitar in the aisles. The mind reels. In orchestrating ''Within You Without You: A Tribute to George Harrison,'' Mr. McKenzie is hoping to attract younger audiences. He regards the City Center season as an opportunity for risk-taking; that, in part, is what the Harrison ballet is about, he said. ''I think it's great that we do the classics well, but I think it's as important to be redefining the art form,'' he said. ''What are the 'Swan Lakes' of next century? That's what I want City Center to be. That laboratory -- it's the time in which we live.''

VTHE political process is important, it really is. It seems wrong to laugh at it, it really does. It also seems impossible not to, when it takes the form of a seven-way debate marked by careful answers, evasions, 10- and 15-second ''lightning rounds'' and not one focused exchange between the two leading candidates for governor, because a seven-way debate isn't. A debate, that is. That is what it purported to be yesterday, in the Columbus Avenue studios of WABC-TV. But its relevance might best be summed up by one participant's answer to a question about the future of the World Trade Center site, a matter over which the governor of New York exercises great influence. ''What would I know about that?'' he asked. What indeed.

VGov. George E. Pataki stood behind his record over two terms yesterday during a debate with six other candidates for governor that offered a range of solutions to New York State's ills -- from cutting taxes to regulating marijuana -- but little opportunity to scrutinize them. Mr. Pataki, in his first-ever debate as a candidate for governor, did not specify what he planned for a third term beyond saying, ''We are not going to raise taxes next year'' to close a budget deficit that may swell to up to $7 billion.

VDave Eget doesn't do it because it's supposed to be cool. And he certainly doesn't do it because it looks as if he's using marijuana, since he paid for that particular aspect of his habit last spring by having his car searched by the police. No, Mr. Eget rolls his own cigarettes because it costs a fraction of what he used to pay for ready-mades, and he is hardly alone. As state and local governments pile new taxes on maunfactured cigarettes in efforts to discourage smoking and to increase revenue, a practice that conjures up images of Depression-era hobos and old cowboy Westerns has become increasingly common around the country.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-10 Rumsfeld War Guidelines Call for Early Action Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, in a personal set of guidelines for committing forces to combat, wrote that leaders must quickly judge when diplomacy has failed, then ''act forcefully, early, during the pre-crisis period'' to foil an attack on the nation. A1 Bali Death Toll Rises The death toll in the car bombing in Bali, Indonesia, climbed to at least 184, including at least 2 Americans. A dozen of the 300 injured survivors were in critical condition and another 30 bodies were believed to be buried in the rubble. The attacks were being attributed to Indonesian terrorists, possibly linked to Al Qaeda or other Islamic extremists. A1

VSunday's ''debate'' among seven candidates for governor of New York State was a light political merry-go-round, a 90-minute whirl in which each candidate had no more than a dozen minutes to address issues great and incredibly minor. George Pataki, the incumbent, had insisted that all third-party candidates be included. The governor should get points for politeness, but it was obvious that his real goal was to drain the event of any import. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, now says he was wrong eight years ago, when he ran against Mario Cuomo, to have insisted on one-on-one debates while Mr. Cuomo was the one who wanted to get lost in a crowd. The present governor certainly seemed satisfied with the muddled production Sunday, sitting calmly while the Marijuana Reform candidate suggested that legalized pot would raise state revenues, the Libertarian candidate argued that he was a pot-smoker who didn't want to pay any more taxes on anything and the Right to Life candidate waved at his students.

VSam Garnes was on the field when Randy Moss disappeared in the 2000 N.F.C. championship game against the Giants -- 2 receptions for 18 yards -- and he was on the field when Moss exploded last season for 10 receptions, 171 yards and 3 touchdowns. Those are the extremes of Moss, the National Football League's biggest enigma, who is so gifted that his coach has instituted the ''Randy Ratio.'' But Moss also has a talent for finding trouble that sometimes overwhelms his extraordinary talent for catching passes for the Minnesota Vikings.

Sitting in the family car in a shopping center parking lot, she told her mother, ''They're going to kill me, Ma, if they find me,'' Cindi Measles, Maryann's mother, recalled.

VThe mayor of New York City does not seem to be a particularly puritanical man. Michael Bloomberg is a guy who, when asked if he had ever tried marijuana, replied: ''You bet I did. And I enjoyed it.'' (Alas, he's not willing to advocate decriminalizing the experience for the rest of us, but that's a subject for another day.) He once fondly likened his college fraternity to the one in ''Animal House,'' and he still enjoys a party. He is no libertarian, let alone libertine, but his attitude toward private pleasure is pretty much live and let live. On the subject of tobacco, though, he has surprised many constituents with his zeal. First he slapped on a city tax increase that raises the price of a pack of cigarettes to around $7. Now he proposes to outlaw smoking in every bar and restaurant in the five boroughs of New York.

VTom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate for governor, said yesterday that he would close the state's looming budget deficit by pushing some people off Medicaid, limiting others from signing up and holding the line on financing for education. He said stern measures were needed to avert tax increases that he said would block economic revitalization. Serious budget reduction must start with Medicaid and education because they are the state's two costliest programs, he said. But, he said, such proposals are ''not going to make a lot of people happy.''

VOn the eve of the second debate in the governor's race, H. Carl McCall yesterday pledged that he would strengthen the state rent-regulation laws that expire next year. Referring to the Democratic Party as ''the party of tenants,'' Mr. McCall sought to continue the strategy he has pursued all week: remind the city's mostly Democratic voters that Mr. Pataki is a Republican with a Republican ideology. He spoke at a small rally across the street from Stuyvesant Town on the east side of Manhattan in an appearance with some of the city's leading tenants' rights advocates.

Property taxes in New York State are well above the national average of 1.5 percent of the value of a home. Many New Yorkers pay 3.5 to 4 percent of the value of their home in property tax. Do you think this is a problem? And if so, what can you do on the state level to lessen the property tax burden?

VMore than four months after he died face down on a sidewalk in the Manhattan neighborhood where he lived most of his life, a 36-year-old man remains on a refrigerated steel shelf in Room 15A of the New York City morgue. The man, Anthony Ferro, died suddenly when bystanders pinned him down on an Upper West Side street after he smashed a stranger's face with a videotape. Mr. Ferro's anguished family has insisted that his body stay at the morgue until they determine whether a second autopsy might help make sense of his death.

VHas there ever been a designer's catwalk that produced better fashion than a city sidewalk? Is there a style, high or low, that has not felt the influence of Fifth Avenue, or Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn, or the Rue Bonaparte, where Isabella Blow, above, a sometimes muse to designers, appears as a wind-tossed apparition blown across the old Parisian cobblestones. ''Everything in fashion begins in the street,'' the fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg said. Take cargo pants, one of the most ubiquitous of garments, whose entry into the fashion mainstream was anything but top down. ''That didn't come from anyone in 'fashion,''' said Julie Gilhart, the fashion director of Barneys. ''It came from the street.'' So, too, did buttocks-baring trousers, and preppy plaids worn ironically, and do-rags and belt buckles with one's name spelled out in block letters. None of these notions originated on any designer's sketch pad and yet each turned up on the fall runways of Dolce & Gabbana, Jean Paul Gaultier and Anna Sui. The photo essays Bill Cunningham contributed to The Times -- since 1989 in a column called ''On the Street'' and for years before under other titles -- have played a compelling part in recording the ephemeral nature of self-invention. Positioning himself in the slipstream of urban imagery, Mr. Cunningham has created an almanac of what city dwellers were wearing at various points in the late 20th century and, probably more important, what they were thinking about themselves at the time.

VA federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled yesterday that the federal government may not revoke the licenses of doctors who recommend marijuana to their patients. The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is the biggest legal victory yet for voter initiatives in nine states that legalized marijuana for medical purposes. It upholds a five-year-old lower-court decision that blocked the government's efforts to frustrate a 1996 initiative in California.

VA federal appeals court in California this week struck an important blow for medical marijuana, and for the First Amendment. It held that the government cannot revoke the licenses of doctors who recommend marijuana to their patients. The federal government should now abandon its misguided policy of targeting doctors and sick people to fight marijuana use. The ruling gives new life to the medical marijuana initiative, also known as Proposition 215, which California voters passed in 1996. The law permits seriously ill people to use marijuana on the advice of their physicians, and it says that doctors may not be punished for recommending marijuana to their patients. Shortly after it became law, the federal government announced it would use its authority under the Controlled Substances Act to revoke the prescription licenses of doctors who recommended marijuana to a patient.

VTHE CASE AGAINST LAWYERS How the Lawyers, Politicians, and Bureaucrats Have Turned the Law Into an Instrument of Tyranny -- and What We as Citizens Have to Do About It By Catherine Crier 245 pages. Broadway Books. $23.95 It was a few years ago, sitting in a barber's chair, that I came face to face with the niggling over-regulation of American life. When it came time to trim my neck hairs with a straight razor, my barber used his fingers to smear a cold, anemic, trickly, machine-made substance on my skin. What, I asked him, happened to shaving brushes and hot, thick lather? New health-code regulations, he replied. Using a brush and shaving soap in a nice porcelain mug had been decreed illegal.

VVoters in dozens of states will face a series of initiatives and referendums when they go to the polls next week, including proposals to expand after-school programs in California, abolish bilingual education in Massachusetts, decriminalize Nevadans' personal use of marijuana and, in Florida, set new guidelines for the confinement of pregnant pigs. Oregon has two of the most closely watched and intensely fought ballot initiatives. The more ambitious would provide comprehensive health care for all residents, with financing coming in part from new personal income and payroll taxes. A second measure would require labels identifying genetically engineered foods sold in the state.

The nine states that have laws that allow medical uses of marijuana generally require a doctor's recommendation for the drug. The appeals court said the federal government may not use threats of professional discipline to override such laws. Under the First Amendment, the court said, ''physicians must be able to speak frankly and openly to patients.'' Adam Liptak

VThe matre d'htel at La Grenouille was expressionless as he scanned Johnny Knoxville's scuffed leather jacket and baggy maintenance-man slacks. ''Peut-tre celui-ci,'' Armel Gren murmured, coaxing a navy blazer over his guest. With a polka-dotted ascot, arranged to conceal sweater holes, the star of ''Jackass the Movie'' was fit to enter the dim, hushed, crimson-and-gold dining room of one of the finest and stuffiest restaurants in New York.

VWhen Abu-Ali Abdur Rahman was sentenced to death in Tennessee in 1987, his lawyers failed to introduce evidence that would probably have gotten him a lesser punishment. The Supreme Court, which is to hear arguments today in a challenge to his death sentence, should prevent his execution. It is wrong to impose capital punishment on a defendant because his lawyers are incompetent. Mr. Abdur Rahman, who was convicted of the 1986 murder of a Nashville man from whom he had previously bought marijuana, had a long history of mental illness. He was abused as a child, and was discharged from the Army as a teenager because of emotional problems. While serving time in prison for a previous crime he was raped repeatedly, and has been described by doctors as ''highly disturbed.'' Tennessee law requires juries to take mitigating evidence into account before they impose the death penalty. But Mr. Abdur Rahman's lawyers never investigated his mental problems, and did not tell the jury about them.

VVoters in 40 states weighed in on a wide array of citizen-backed ballot initiatives and referendums that sought fundamental changes in health care, drug policy, school programs and transportation. In Oregon, a plan to create a single statewide health plan for all residents appeared to be headed for resounding defeat. The proposal would have replaced almost all public and private health care programs and individual health insurance, at a cost to state taxpayers of $1.7 billion in the first year.

VThe incumbent Republican governor, Kenny Guinn, was so certain of a second term that he stopped fund-raising and told donors who had pledged more than $1 million to his campaign that they should keep their money. With broad, bipartisan support, Mr. Guinn was easily re-elected. Democrats had hoped to pick up the House seat in a newly created suburban Las Vegas district. But their candidate, Dario Herrera, a telegenic county commissioner and former University of Nevada football player, was battered by television commercials questioning his ethics, and polls suggested he would lose to State Senator Jon Porter, the Republican candidate.

VNew York's Liberal Party, after a half-century of playing at times the cagey ally, at other times the nemesis to both Republicans and Democrats, lost its place on all ballots for the next four years. Under state law, any party that receives 50,000 votes on its line for its candidate for governor is guaranteed a place in every election for the next four years, from town boards to United States senator. With about 90 percent of election districts reporting, it appeared that the Liberal Party candidate, Andrew M. Cuomo, would draw fewer than 20,000 votes.

VGiven the broad, bipartisan support that carried him to a second term, Gov. Kenny Guinn might consider himself an honorary Democrat about now. Mr. Guinn swept to victory over Joe Neal, a Democrat, thanks in part to the support of traditionally Democratic union leaders. There was also a big margin of victory for the Republican candidate for the new House seat created in suburban Las Vegas, the result of Nevada's huge population growth.

VJanet Napolitano, the attorney general, appeared to have succeeded in her bid to become the state's first Democratic governor in 12 years. With all precincts reporting Election Day returns but thousands of early ballots still to be counted, Ms. Napolitano has been holding on to a small lead. She won strong support on Indian reservations and in Hispanic neighborhoods, out-polling her Republican opponent, Matt Salmon, a former congressman. In the First District, which covers more than half the state's land area, Rick Renzi, a Republican businessman, defeated George Cordova, a Democratic venture capitalist.

VA judge went on voluntary leave after admitting he smoked marijuana at a Rolling Stones concert. A woman told court officials that she saw the judge, Thomas Gilbert of District Court, smoke a marijuana cigarette passed along a row of people at the concert in Detroit on Oct. 12. At a meeting this week with Chief Judge Michael Haley and Judge Thomas J. Phillips, Judge Gilbert admitted the incident. He left the bench on Wednesday and will be on leave until at least Nov. 15. When he returns, he will handle only civil cases.

VTime was, an album by Whitney Houston sold like anything designed by Prada. She needed little, or even no, promotion to sell an album, people in the music industry say. She was a high-class act, a brand name. But after years of obscurity, unpleasant headlines -- including an arrest for possession of marijuana -- and questions about her health, Ms. Houston has been knocked down a notch. Now she needs to be promoted like any department store line. And for her new album, ''Just Whitney,'' scheduled for release on Dec. 10, to be successful, she needs to be seen by her listeners.

VWhen Case Western Reserve University first pitched Peter B. Lewis the idea of sponsoring the ''greatest business school in the history of business schools,'' as he puts it, the price tag came to an optimistic $25 million. Being one of the city's most avid philanthropists, Mr. Lewis said ''sure, fine,'' then signed on to pay for the bulk of it. Some six years later, with its bulbous sheets of steel and glass, the school's building looks like popcorn exploding, as if it burst open from the sheer dynamism of the ideas burgeoning inside. But with finishing touches by the architect, Frank Gehry, still waiting to be applied, the cost has likewise ballooned to $61.7 million, and Mr. Lewis can think of only one place to lay the blame.

VPeter B Lewis, major philanthropist in Cleveland, demands resignation of Case Western Reserve University's entire board of directors, saying cost overrun on business school building he agreed to fund is latest in series of missteps by board; $25 million project has ballooned to $61.7 million; university has gone through four presidents in four years, one of whom resigned weeks before graduation out of frustration with trustees; they have been accused of, and sometimes admit to, micromanagement, possible conflicts of interest, as well as being too parochial to turn university into national academic powerhouse it hopes to be; school's standing appears to have slipped; Lewis is also waging financial boycott of every cultural and charitable organization he has supported in Cleveland until Case Western's board of four dozen members steps down; he contends that Cleveland is such insular community that many institutions share same board members; photos (M)

VLarry Campbell, a former policeman and the leading mayoral candidate, was campaigning down his old beat on West Hastings Street the other night when a man in a denim jacket and with a straggly goatee gestured to him. He might have been a prospective voter, but he had something other than politics on his mind. ''Bud?'' the man said, parlance for marijuana among the street dealers in the Downtown Eastside section of Vancouver. Mr. Campbell shook the dealer off and looked for other voters to greet in a neighborhood where drugs, prostitution and homelessness have become an eyesore and scourge in recent years. ''On this street you get anything you want,'' he said, shaking his head. ''Weed is the least offense.''

VAlex and Derek King, the teenage brothers whose second-degree murder convictions for the bludgeoning death of their father were thrown out by a judge last month, pleaded guilty today to third-degree murder. As a result, they will be spared the much lengthier sentences they faced if the jury verdict had stood. Under an agreement reached after a week of mediation between prosecutors and defense lawyers, Alex, 13, will serve seven years in prison and Derek, 14, will serve eight years for the November 2001 killing of Terry King, who was beaten to death with a baseball bat as he slept in a recliner in the living room of their home in Pensacola, Fla.

VTHE guy certainly seemed the upstanding sort. He had been in the Army, oozed self-discipline and was a skilled carpenter. It all looked good, so after outlining the rules -- no large parties, no sleepover guests, to name two -- Carole and Gordon Hyatt took the fellow on as caretaker of their vacation getaway in the Berkshires. Then one day, quite unexpectedly, Mr. Hyatt, a documentary filmmaker, needed to go up to the house. He arrived to find the fireplace at such a roar that smoke was billowing around the couple's newly upholstered furniture. Beer cans littered the living room, and the caretaker was busy taking care of half a dozen guests, all smoking marijuana. ''The scene was out of a 60's biker movie,'' said Ms. Hyatt, a career consultant. ''My husband was beyond apoplectic. He literally threw the guy and his clothes out the door.''

VANYONE who drives Interstate highways knows the numbing effect of mile after mile of sameness, long stretches where the landmarks are gas stations and the exit signs seem light-years apart. But of all the highways that turn driving to drudgery, the epitome may be California's Interstate 5. Officially, I-5 goes from Mexico to Canada, but most Californians think of it as the pin-straight four-lane section that bisects the arid San Joaquin Valley for the fastest drive between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Five, as this chunk of road is known, manages to bypass all of California's stunning scenery and landscapes and instead offers mile after monotonous mile of parched desert scrub, thirsty-looking garlic and corn crops, and endless power lines and aqueducts paralleling the road.

VCULTURALLY speaking, Manhattan's Lower East Side is the underground's underground, a radical alternative to most alternatives you can name. Immigrants and club kids, cranks and mystics, the lost and the found, the high and the dry, have long called it home and still do, along with a professional army of young 10-to-6ers who have sent rents through the roof. Poetry and art have both had big moments here, in the 1960's and 1980's respectively. Poetry sustained some of that momentum; art did not, but this could be changing. In the last two years, several galleries have opened in the neighborhood roughly defined by Houston and Canal Streets, the Bowery and the East River, joining others already there. A brand new alternative space -- Participant -- opens on Rivington Street today. Artists Space, now in SoHo, has hooked some property, tentatively at least. The New Museum is said to be looking hard. In addition, there is activity, steady if far from seismic, in the East Village to the north and in Chinatown to the south, areas that are part of what might be called the Greater Lower East Side.

VFrom clandestine chats along the sidelines of suburban football games to the hostile takeover of the Sinderella strip club and video store on Crooked Hill Road, the allegations of how the Luchese crime family operated on Long Island sound like something dreamed up by a television screenwriter. In fact, they were presented today by Suffolk County investigators when they announced the criminal charges against 14 men accused of being members and associates of the Luchese family. The 14 were arrested Wednesday in raids of homes, cars and businesses on Long Island and in Brooklyn and Queens.

VAn estimated nine million Americans a year drive while under the influence of illegal drugs, but efforts to identify, arrest and treat them have been hampered by the weakness of state laws and, until recently, a lack of quick and reliable drug tests, a new report says. The report, issued yesterday by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, calls on states to adopt criminal laws setting strict standards on the presence of drugs in a driver's body, just as they use blood alcohol content to determine that a driver is intoxicated.

VWearing camouflage and armed with machetes, a dozen police officers waited in the gathering heat of morning for a helicopter that was to drop them into a marijuana farm, in the hills two miles distant. Rattlesnakes, poison oak and bee stings would be the least of their concerns, the officers were warned before the raid: They might be welcomed with gunfire.

VThis sturdy town in the Appalachian foothills likes to call itself ''the carpet capital of the world,'' and its industry has thrived over the last decade as thousands of Mexican immigrants have flocked to jobs in the mills. More recently, though, federal and local law enforcement officials say the same pipeline of immigration and trade has been exploited by Mexican drug traffickers, who have helped turn this corner of northwestern Georgia into a busy distribution center for methamphetamine and other drugs.

VAmerican towns that draw Mexican immigrants are being turned into distribution centers for Mexican drug dealers, who take advantage of immigrants and freer North American trade; Mexicans have both displaced other traffickers -- with relatively little violence -- and opened new markets themselves, creating more efficient flows of drugs deep into US even as border controls have tightened; dealers have improved quality and increased output of Mexican heroin and marijuana, negotiated to receive more cocaine from South American producers and pioneered large-scale production of methamphetamine, fastest-growing illegal drug in US; Dalton, Ga, illustrates trend; photo (M)

V''Better Housekeeping'' -- which was titled ''Good Housekeeping'' until that magazine's lawyers woke up a couple of weeks ago -- looks at first glance like one of those sneering portraits of redneck domestic strife that have been a staple of American independent films since the Coen brothers' 1984 ''Blood Simple.'' It looks like that at second glance, too -- with its story of a spectacularly dysfunctional marriage between Don (Bob Mills), a grizzled loser who marginally supports himself by dealing in collectible action figures at flea markets, and Donatella (Petra Westen), an Italian immigrant who operates a fork lift at a recycling center for old fabric.

VRUTH M. LIEBESMAN wants the point made that serious people are involved with the newly reconstituted New York City chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws; Norml, for short. Ms. Liebesman, who is 44 and a criminal defense lawyer, keeps bringing this up. She looks serious -- and tired, her brown hair still damp as she sits in a Midtown hotel for breakfast. She did not get home until 2:30 a.m. from the group's coming-out party at Tobacco Road, a Hell's Kitchen bar.

VWillie Shaw's four-game suspension from the St. John's basketball team is the result of a positive test for marijuana, he revealed for the first time yesterday. Shaw, a junior guard, was suspended for the Red Storm's final game last season, an 80-70 loss to Wisconsin in the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, and will miss the first three games this season. St. John's opens Tuesday against Stony Brook. Before yesterday's announcement, Shaw and St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis had declined to reveal the reason for the suspension.

V''We was jacked by Santa Claus,'' Craig (Ice Cube) says to the bored cops who show up after he's been robbed of his Christmas presents. The theft is perhaps the year's most audacious slapstick sequence, in which a larcenous neighborhood Santa breaks into Craig's apartment and beats the sweat off Craig with a Christmas tree. This scene is a real crack-up, as is much of the first 20 minutes or so of ''Friday After Next,'' the latest in the ''Friday'' series. One hesitates to say ''newest,'' since most of the jokes probably predate Fred Flintstone. I'm not even sure the funny but slovenly ''Friday After Next'' legally qualifies as a movie -- it was photographed like a drive-by, and the lighting seems to change from shot to shot, as if the film is being developed before your very eyes.

VA selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show. Museums ''A LEGACY IN LANDSCAPES,'' New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 (through Jan. 4). More than 100 additions to the library's voluminous print collection by nearly 60 artists, from Fragonard and Pissarro to present-day practitioners like Alex Katz, Roxy Paine and Terry Winters are on display. Mostly traditional printmaking methods are used and the choices are fairly conservative at the contemporary end. So Sylvia Plimack Mangold's drypoint and etching ''Maple Tree'' (1998), for instance, a close-up rendering of intersecting bare-tree branches, keeps good company with William Delamotte's etching of almost 200 years earlier, ''Beech in Windsor Forest.'' (1805-6), a stagey old monster whose thick, knotty ramifications are examined in minute detail. But the continuity is pleasurable. All in all, the library has chosen well. Hours: Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Grace Glueck).

VAngelo Bermudez ran an auto body shop in the Bronx and owned a prizewinning collection of antique cars. They included a 1959 Chevrolet Impala, a 1956 Bel Air wagon and a candy-apple-red 1962 Corvette convertible, as well as a turquoise 1954 Ford truck and a 1957 Volkswagen Beetle. He also operated a multimillion-dollar drug-smuggling operation, law enforcement officials say, moving a ton of cocaine and almost as much marijuana in the last two years.

VHadda Brooks, the smoky-voiced torch singer and pianist who was known in the 1940's as the Queen of the Boogie and came out of retirement in the late 1980's to gain new popularity with younger audiences, died on Thursday at 86. She died at White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles, a few weeks after undergoing open-heart surgery, said Russ Paul, her manager.

VAfter more than a season of disappointing play, Howard Eisley has finally started to show some promise in a Knicks uniform. Starting the last five games because of Charlie Ward's leg injury, Eisley has played exceptionally well in two of the Knicks' past three games. In the loss to Philadelphia on Nov. 16, Eisley had 16 points and 10 assists while bottling up Allen Iverson. Eisley had 6 points and 8 assists in a victory over Detroit, and then a season-high 17 points and a career-high 14 assists in Friday's 105-97 overtime loss to New Orleans.

VDespite what the major record labels would have you believe, for many musicians the most troubling thing about online song-swapping services is not that fans are taking their music without paying. The fact is, few musicians on major labels see royalties as it is. What is more upsetting about online file-sharing services is that fans often get ahold of demo tapes and unfinished versions of songs. In the case of System of a Down, the eclectic Los Angeles heavy-rock band of Armenian heritage, incomplete versions of songs that didn't make it onto its last album, the No. 1 selling ''Toxicity,'' found their way onto the Internet. There, fans added the music to the band's oeuvre. (For the 14-track ''Toxicity,'' the band recorded 33 songs.) The group's ''Steal This Album,'' perhaps the first CD of its kind, is meant to combat the leak with completed versions of the material, for which the band returned to the studio to add extra guitar, vocals and production. The title is more than a reference to Abbie Hoffman's ''Steal This Book'': band members say they really don't mind if the album gets stolen.

VWhen a senior aide to Prime Minister Jean Chrtien called President Bush a ''moron'' in a recent private conversation overheard by a reporter, she might have been voicing the frustrations of Canadians who tend to see their dominant southern neighbor as a place where profits come before health care and guns before safety. Those frustrations appeared to bubble over this week with what might otherwise have been a childish indiscretion by the aide, Mr. Chrtien's communications director, Franoise Ducros, who resigned on Tuesday.

VA bus company supervisor has been charged with selling crack cocaine across the street from the Queens district attorney's office, officials said yesterday. Undercover officers said they saw the supervisor, Dennis Arango, above, of the Green Lines Bus Company, sell drugs to another man in a parked car on Monday, the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said. The police said they seized a dozen bags of crack cocaine, one bag of marijuana, one ecstasy tablet and $176 in cash from him. If he is convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison. Mr. Arango's lawyer, Dennis Coppin, refused to comment. A Green Lines spokesman, Jamie Van Bramer, said that if the allegations proved true, Mr. Arango would be dismissed. Stacy Albin (NYT)

VA selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show. Museums * ''A VERY PRIVATE COLLECTION: JANICE H. LEVIN'S IMPRESSIONIST PICTURES,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 9). Quiet acquisitors who never went public with their holdings, the late Janice and Philip Levin had assembled a strong if not venturesome collection of Impressionist and other works, including Bonnard, Cassatt, Corot, Derain, Giacometti, Monet, Modigliani, Morisot, Picasso, Pissarro, Toulouse-Lautrec and Vuillard. Among the gems are Monet's celebrations of nature ''Artist's Garden at Argenteuil'' from 1873 and his ''On the Cliff at Pourville, Clear Weather''; Degas's acutely observed '' la Bourse (Portraits in the Stock Exchange)''; and Derain's ''Plate of Peaches,'' a tiny but firmly structured composition meant as a homage to Czanne. As with every collection, there are weaknesses, including a clichd Renoir, ''Gondola in Venice.'' But collections are all about taste, and this is one where it was firmly exercised. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

VWe interrupt our coverage of the war on terrorism to check in with that other permanent conflict against a stateless enemy, the war on drugs. To judge by the glee at the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the drug warriors have just accomplished the moral equivalent of routing the Taliban -- helping to halt a relentless jihad against the nation's drug laws. Ballot initiatives in Ohio (treatment rather than prison for nonviolent drug offenders), Arizona (the same, plus making marijuana possession the equivalent of a traffic ticket, and providing free pot for medical use) and Nevada (full legalization of marijuana) lost decisively this month. Liberalization measures in Florida and Michigan never even made it to the ballot.

VBill Keller Op-Ed column on defeat of ballot measures to ease laws against marijuana discusses disproportionate stress of drug war discourse on marijuana; questions why White House and its drug czar, John Walters, are so obsessed with marijuana; disputes Walters's stands that marijuana leads to use of other drugs and that there has been alarming rise in number of people hooked on drug; holds drug reformers need political courage to face down ideologues; drawing (M)

VMany people in this affluent rural town are unaccustomed to locking their doors. But that began to change today, after two neighbors were found murdered in their home here on Thanksgiving morning in what the authorities said appeared to be a random attack. ''We're just horrified -- everybody's locking their doors today,'' said Sandy Todd, a substitute teacher who lives with her husband and two children only a short walk from the home of Ronald Ahrlich, 66, and his wife, Roberta, 61, whose bodies were found by relatives arriving for Thanksgiving dinner. ''If this was random and a stranger, it's just unheard of.''

VEven as investigators pick through the rubble of the bombed-out Paradise Hotel, there are still men leading sluggish camels along the scorching sand of Kenya's picturesque coastline, goading tourists into taking a ride. ''I'm praying the tourists don't go away,'' said Ali Hassan Abdi, 31, who makes a living by charging the equivalent of $6 for a ride on his camel, a sturdy beast named Amsa.

VTHERE is a ghost that hangs heavy over the town of Waycross, a railroad hub in southeastern Georgia that has fallen on hard times. Though most folks move through the streets oblivious to it, some people say they can actually see it. And they see it everywhere. ''Before me, gentlemen, Gram once walked down these streets, as sure as I did,'' said Billy Ray Herrin, a local songwriter who held a tribute to Parsons here last week. He was sitting in the passenger seat of a crowded rental car. ''Take a right here,'' he said. ''I'm going to show you the exact monkey bars that he used to swing on.''

VLike surgically detached Siamese twins, the Dutch fashion designers Viktor and Rolf are the spit and image of each other. They were born the same year, wear the same clothes, don the same glasses and, give or take a few millimeters, are even the same size. At the finale of their runway shows, they appear dressed in matching outfits inspired by the collection, and that becomes part of the performance. In fact, their whole life is a performance, and the world of fashion is their stage. They are creatures of their own creation, like Charlie Chaplin's ''Little Tramp.'' Every fashionista wants to go to a Viktor and Rolf show in Paris. They know they'll be transported into a world they've never seen -- something theatrical, something intellectual, something that makes them look and think. Whether it's a Busby Berkeley tribute with all the models tap-dancing or an entire runway show in miniature, their work makes as much sense at the Whitney as it does on a Paris runway. Viktor and Rolf are artists, and fashion is their medium. And though their clothes aren't always the easiest to understand, their biggest dream is to be hugely commercial. And in fact, L'Oral recently signed the Dutch treats to create a perfume -- Viktor and Rolf may not be known beyond the cognoscenti, but perfume is about fantasy, and these boys clearly know about that.

VNow that it appears Pierre Monagan will fully recover from being shot in the face, Marist Coach Dave Magarity has to get back to the business of basketball. Can Marist depend on Monagan's return or should he be redshirted? Magarity expected Monagan to be his starting point guard until a bullet shattered Monagan's cheek on Nov. 1 at a nightclub across the street from the Marist campus in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Monagan was a bystander on the dance floor when a gun went off during an argument between two people. (A 20-year-old Poughkeepsie man was charged with first-degree assault and first-degree reckless endangerment.) Doctors wired Monagan's jaw shut, and he has progressed to where he can walk and shoot free throws during practice.

SCHLOAT, the president of Human Relations Media, has an unexpected hit on his hands, a 26-minute video called ''Dying High: Teens in the ER,'' which has become the hot teaching tool in Westchester County. The video, one of more than 300 educational products in the company's catalog, jumped to the top of the charts within a month of its September release as a result of an episode of binge drinking before the homecoming dance in Scarsdale, which ended with several youths in White Plains Hospital Center with acute alcohol poisoning.

VIn an effort to stem a growing reputation as a band of rogues and thugs, the Portland Trail Blazers' marketing team created a series of television commercials that have run this year. In the ads, Derek Anderson, Rasheed Wallace and Ruben Patterson play door-to-door salesmen, dressed in cheap suits and hats, trying to get a foot in the door to ply their wares -- in this case, Long-Distance, Jam and Hustle -- and then rip off the suits to reveal their Blazers uniforms. Since those ads were created, Wallace and Patterson were arrested in the first month of the season. As the Blazers' on- and off-court escapades continue, it has become harder even for those within the locker room to endure the discontent.

Edison High School in Jamaica unfolded about 8:20 a.m. as the student, Joel Powell, passed through a magnetometer at the entrance of the vocational school and was stopped and questioned by a school safety agent who noticed a large object inside his jacket, the police said.

VSCOTT SALVATOR'S decoration-encrusted offices and apartment on the Upper East Side are guarded by a four-pound, 15-inch-long Yorkshire terrier named Butch. Don't even think about breaking in. Butch leapt at the front door like water splashing out of a powder room sink when the bell rang last week, barking for blood. ''Are we safe?'' called Mr. Salvator, 43, an interior designer who lives and works with Michael Zabriskie, 46, in an Aladdin's cave of three-foot-tall silver Champagne buckets, palm tree floor lamps, pink filing cabinets and cut-glass top hats. He has three dishes set out for the silky, brushed and combed gorgon, with water and wet and dry food. Butch, 13 months, has an ocelot-spotted tennis ball, too.

VElijah Ingram has a lightning first step to the basket, an acute court sense and a cool demeanor that belies his explosiveness. But St. John's had seen Ingram, its freshman point guard, show his attributes sporadically. Last night against St. Francis of Brooklyn, Ingram put together his most complete performance to grab attention from Marcus Hatten's usual scoring barrage as the Red Storm rolled to an 80-58 victory at Alumni Hall. The Red Storm is 4-0 for the first time since the 1994-95 season.

But as Mr. Spano summed up their comments, a girl in the back interrupted to say that the students had even more concerns about his proposals. Then another student, Cammie Erickson, stood up and blurted out, ''The proposals were badly written.''

VLAST February, a Bible study group on Block Island, 150 miles from Westchester County, gathered for its weekly discussion. The conversation that day focused on magnetic personalities within the church, people who drew others toward them and generated almost cult-like devotion. Had anyone there ever met such a charismatic figure? ''I knew someone like that once,'' said Sarah Lomax, a member of the group. ''He was a pastor at a church I used to belong to in Mount Kisco.''

VSt. John's played carefree basketball yesterday and comfortably dispatched an overmatched opponent. The Red Storm's 84-59 shredding of Hofstra gave St. John's five consecutive victories over teams it was expected to beat and a 5-0 record for the first time since the 1994-95 season. This is worth noting, because in each of the previous two seasons, St. John's lost to a lesser local team early in its schedule. Coach Mike Jarvis said he had more players competing for playing time this season, so the routs are happening more often.

VHarold Clurman Theater 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton Priscilla Lopez displays so much versatility in the one-woman play ''Class Mothers '68'' that, oddly, a sort of audience fatigue sets in midway through. She portrays six different mothers over an intermissionless hour and 45 minutes, and by about mother No. 4 you begin to feel mothered out.

VA judge who admitted to smoking marijuana began hearing cases again in District Court in Traverse City. Judge Thomas S. Gilbert, 45, removed himself from the bench in November after he was seen smoking marijuana in October at a Rolling Stones concert. He completed an alcohol rehabilitation program and will not hear cases involving alcohol or marijuana charges indefinitely. The board of governors for the bar association representing lawyers in the judge's district continues to call for Judge Gilbert's resignation. David Enders (NYT)

The survey, known as Monitoring the Future, and carried out by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, also found a drop in the use of Ecstasy, the club drug, after several recent years in which the drug had exploded in popularity among adolescents.

VSpike Lee's ''25th Hour'' begins with an aerial tour of Manhattan at night, set to the gilded sob of Terence Blanchard's lush, urbane orchestral jazz. It may not be the most original way to start a movie, but this visual and sonic overture, created by Mr. Lee with the help of Mr. Blanchard and the cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, has an unexpected emotional impact. This particular skyline is dominated by the twin columns of light that illuminated downtown as a tribute to those who died in the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2001. Watching the beams fade into the dawn on screen stirred up some half-buried sorrows, which I found a little jarring. The New York of the movies has always been an exaggerated, even fantastical version of the real place, and this division has seemed especially acute in the past year. Even in newer movies, the cinematic city has frequently offered a backward or sidelong escape from the post-9/11 real thing.

VSometime in the spring of 1968, a lanky, clean-cut 23-year-old Jamaican arrived at an apartment on Valentine Avenue in the Bronx with a guitar and a future no one could have possibly imagined. He was Bob Marley, who eventually sold tens of millions of albums and built reggae into an international musical movement but who at this point was dead set on learning the mysteries of rhythm and blues. To that end he had gone to the Bronx to sit at the heels of Jimmy Norman, then a 31-year-old composer and crooner who had written dozens of hit songs for the singer and producer Johnny Nash. Mr. Nash had just signed Marley to his record label, JAD Records.

VFOR four years, George Clooney waited to play Jim Byrd, the Zen-cool agent who recruits a fast-living television producer for the C.I.A. in the film version of Chuck Barris's bizarre 1984 memoir, ''Confessions of a Dangerous Mind: An Unauthorized Biography.'' With its claim that his high-profile career as the instigator of television tripe like ''The Gong Show'' and ''The Dating Game'' had masked an undercover job as a government assassin, Mr. Barris's wacky, James-Bond-in-Hollywood account of sex, murder and intrigue seemed ripe for the movies. Mr. Clooney had fallen in love with a script written by Charlie Kaufman (''Being John Malkovich,'' ''Adaptation''), and he clung to the role of Byrd as the project passed from hand to hand.

VFive people were slain within eight hours Friday night and early yesterday in a spasm of violence that the police said began when a 17-year-old girl stabbed her sister-in-law in a fight over a telephone and ended with the mysterious killing of a man who was stabbed in the throat on a Brooklyn street. The spate of killing was unusual at a time when the murder rate has dropped to record levels in the city and police officials say the year is likely to end with fewer than 600 homicides, a low not seen since 1963. With an average of fewer than two killings a day so far this year, five in eight hours represents a noticeable spike.

V'Is America Going to Pot?'' asked Time magazine on its cover recently. The article was about the battle over legalizing marijuana, and the headline was wordplay on the familiar expression going to pot (synonymous with ''going to hell in a handbasket''), which the headline writer tied into the slang term for the hemp plant. Scholarly potheads know the derivation of pot, the controlled psychoactive substance: the word is rooted in the Mexican Spanish potiguaya, which are marijuana leaves after their pods have been removed. The word may be derived from potacion de guaya, a potation (from the Latin potere, ''to drink'') that causes guaya, ''lamentation'' in Latin American Spanish. Apparently, this was ''the wine of grief'' in which marijuana buds were steeped. (The word marijuana could come from Mariguana, one of the Bahamian islands, or from a seductive Maria Juana -- Mary Jane. It's a mystery.)

Instead, the seven men granted pardons by President Bush on Monday could all be characterized as small fry, at least in terms of the crimes they committed and their public visibility. One had stolen $10.90 out of the mail. Another had been caught making moonshine. A third had turned back the odometer on a car.

Kelly, hands buried in the pockets of his topcoat, walked to the end of the deserted train platform, because he had to see this thing for himself. He stepped carefully down the stairs to the Long Island Rail Road tracks in Queens, threading between two third rails, which carry live electricity. His polished wingtips met wet earth. He said he had not told the local station house that he was coming out to Flushing because he did not want a big scene.

VA 13-year-old boy visiting his grandmother at her Bronx apartment for the Christmas holiday was shot in the head and killed yesterday by a 26-year-old man in the building's elevator, the police said. The boy, Brandon Marcus, had come from his home in Brooklyn to the Clason's Point section of the Bronx to spend a few days at his grandmother's place at 630 Pugsley Avenue. Early yesterday morning, he was shot at close range by a man the police identified as Demetrius James, who lives in the building.

VFelons face serious sanctions that take effect only after they are released from prison; among them are ban on living in public housing, prohibitions against getting certain jobs in plumbing, education and other fields, and loss of right to vote, for life in some states; felons with drug convictions cannot receive welfare, food stamps or student loans; women who serve more than 15 months in prison may be forced to give up their children to foster care; most of sanctions were passed by Congress or state legislatures in 1990's to get tough on crime, often with bipartisan support, but now some judges, prosecutors and advocates for poor argue that laws are counterproductive and need to be re-examined; photos (M)

VA very small distance separated 2-year-old Soribel Batista from death -- a millimeter, no more. The toddler, who was shot in the face Friday afternoon by a bullet the police believe was intended for a drug dealer in Brooklyn, not only survived, but the bullet stopped just short of lodging in her brain. Doctors who operated on her for more than three hours Friday at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center said they were hopeful that she would retain at least some vision in her left eye. ''She was just very lucky because it went behind the eye, but not into the brain,'' said Ole Pederson, a hospital spokesman. ''It was a very narrow escape. They repaired her eye, and fortunately they did not have to remove it, and they are hopeful that she will retain some use of the eye.''

VEarly in December, in a neighborhood schoolyard, a frayed satin ribbon flapped in the wind. Plastic tulips and fabric daisies pushed up from a mound of stuffed animals; plush ears and plastic noses poked through the heavy snow. In front, on a stick, perched a little lavender teddy bear. This was a memorial to LaTesha Parson, a 13-year-old girl who was shot to death in September while walking near the school with her father. The police say that as he argued with another man, a passing car sprayed bullets in their direction, killing LaTesha.

VThe police confiscated $50,000 in bail money from a Wallingford couple who were trying to free their daughter from jail on a marijuana possession charge, saying that the cash smelled like marijuana and probably came from sales of the substance. The couple, Arlene and Martin Edward Santor, who brought the money on Sunday to the Hampshire County Jail in Northampton, Mass., in $20 bills, said they got it from friends of their daughter, Nikita Santor, who was arrested after marijuana and $12,000 were found in a car she was driving. An affidavit said an officer detected a ''slight odor of marijuana'' on the bail money and a police dog confirmed it.

VThere is a tradition among inmates serving long stretches in the nation's houses of correction. The new year is rung in with a little Dick Clark and a little jailhouse juice. The homebrew is lovingly known as hooch in Sing Sing and called pruno in San Quentin, but the process by which it is made is the same. It is a fortified wine concocted from a hodgepodge of ingredients including raisins, prunes (as in pruno), milk or anything containing sugar that can be purloined from the mess hall and fermented into alcohol.

VScotland Yard said it had foiled an attempt by a friend of a gunman to smuggle marijuana to him inside a Kentucky Fried Chicken order delivered to the East London apartment where he and a hostage have been surrounded by the police for more than a week. Detectives agreed to let the friend send the food to Eli Hall, 32, as a negotiating tactic, but when they examined the order they found the drumsticks had been stuffed with cannabis. The next day, when the friend returned with a new order, the police found more of the drug and arrested Junior Skerrett, 22, charging him with possession with intent to sell. The standoff started Dec. 26 after shots were fired from the apartment at the police as they tried to remove a car. Warren Hoge (NYT)

VA New Year's Eve party that ended with the arrests of 26 teenagers on under-age-drinking charges was held in three hotel rooms rented by a man whose son drowned six years ago after a night of drinking in Manhattan, the authorities said today. Among those arrested was the teenage host of the party, whom the police would not name. But an official familiar with the case identified him as Kevin McNeill, 19, of Port Chester. The official said Mr. McNeill's father, Patrick McNeill Sr., had helped secure the hotel rooms for the party after his son assured him there would be no drinking.

A junior at Dundalk High School in Maryland, he carries a full load of courses, loves playing football, and works after school selling newspaper subscriptions. He began smoking marijuana at 14.

VWHEN you turn off busy Route 101 at Cloverdale and head up into the hills, you leave one world behind and enter another. The lumberyard, gas stations and fast-food joints quickly disappear as Route 128 twists its way northwest through scrawny, moss-covered trees. Only a scattering of houses can be seen. Forests of evergreens begin to appear as you drop down the western slope of the coastal ridge into the Anderson Valley, California's own Shangri-La. After passing through downtown Boonville, all seven blocks and 974 souls of it, you start to see grapevines growing in orderly ranks. But this is a vineyard region with a difference, still largely untouched by developers and weekenders. In Napa and Sonoma, the landed gentry drive Range Rovers and wear loafers; here they drive pickups and wear muddy boots. It is, as Bruce C. Cass observes mildly in ''The Oxford Companion to the Wines of North America,'' ''an isolated and somewhat eccentric district.''

VAfter a season in which the Mets were occasionally embarrassed by the actions of some players, they have plans to create a special adviser's position in the organization. The adviser would act as a liaison between the players and the front office and try to help the Mets avoid a repeat of their unfortunate behavior. Two Mets smoked marijuana after a game at Shea Stadium last year. Roberto Alomar and Roger Cedeo got into a fight over the picture from a baseball card from 1988. Armando Benitez and Rey Ordez refused to participate in a promotional photograph day with fans. Finally, Cedeo was arrested for driving under the influence last November.

VLeading scientists began talks here today on whether and how to withhold publication of scientific information that could compromise national security. The discussions at the National Academy of Sciences follow a raft of post-Sept. 11 restrictions on research into some 64 substances that could be used in biological weapons. The discussions were also partly an effort to fend off potential government censorship or other steps to control unclassified research that the new domestic security law terms ''sensitive.''

VTHREATS AND RESPONSES: BIOTERRORISM
p64547
ssVabstract
p64548
VLeading scientists begin talks at National Academy of Sciences in Washington on whether and how to withhold publications of scientific information that could compromise national security; talks follow raft of post-Sept 11 restrictions on research into some 64 substances that could be used in biological weapons; talks are also an effort to fend off potential government censorship or other steps to control unclassified research that new domestic security law terms 'sensitive'; microbiologists say new research data must be published in scientific journals so other scientists can verify quality of research by reproducing results, but they are hesitant to publish full research out of concern that terrorists could use information; discussions bring together two communities that have often viewed each other with distrust, if not disdain: security experts and scientists (M)

VIT wasn't Sinclair Lewis's finest novel, and it certainly wasn't Spencer Tracy's finest film (the original review in The New York Times called it ''as slick and as pat and as implausible as Mr. Lewis's yarn'') but CASS TIMBERLANE (1947) is definitely worth a look -- for the performances and for the theme. Tracy plays the title character, a sober, respectable Midwestern bachelor judge who marries a sexy, not entirely virtuous young blonde (Lana Turner) from the wrong side of town. Unfortunately, Timberlane's stuffy middle-aged friends have never heard of the trophy-wife concept (or just don't think it applies to a man's first marriage) and do not welcome her into their circle with open arms. What else can the Timberlanes do? They move to New York. George Sidney directed -- Tuesday at 6 p.m. on TCM. Roddy McDowall was 13 when he left England for Hollywood to play the youngest son in a stern but loving Welsh coal-mining family in John Ford's HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY (1941). The film made him an overnight star. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times 61 years ago, had some arguments about the story structure but loved the film's looks, declaring it ''in purely pictorial terms,'' a ''stunning masterpiece.'' (A black-and-white one.) Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara and Donald Crisp also star in what is now acknowledged as one of the screen's great human dramas. It won five Oscars, including best picture -- Sunday at 11:45 a.m. on AMC.

VAn article last Wednesday about lore and local eccentricities in the wine-growing country of the Anderson Valley in California misstated the cause of death of a local environmental advocate, Judi Bari. It was not a bomb; although permanently disabled by a pipe bomb in her car in 1990, Ms. Bari died of cancer in 1997. The article also misspelled the name of a marijuana enthusiasts' column appearing in The Advertiser, a local weekly. It is CannabiNotes, not CannibiNotes.

VAt night, the stairwells of the Brooklyn apartment building where Sandra Campbell lives echo with loud music and ceaseless activity. A woman sprays an old armoire with paint and varnish, filling the halls with acrid fumes. Children in heavy coats sit by the main stairwell, where they have spread their homework, trying to ignore the constant foot traffic that tramples their papers. There are greater menaces out there, too, Ms. Campbell knows. Things to distract children, to lead them astray.

VIn ''City of God,'' Fernando Meirelles's scorching anecdotal history of violence in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, a fretful boy with the cute nickname Steak & Fries (Darlan Cunha), begs for a gun that would certify his membership in one of two rival gangs. ''I smoke, I snort, I've killed and robbed,'' he pleads none too convincingly. ''I'm a man.'' Handed a weapon he doesn't know how to use, this eager new recruit, whose voice has barely begun to change, rushes to join one of the clashing posses of armed children swarming through Cidade de Deus (City of God). A sprawling housing project built in the 1960's on the outskirts of Rio and left to fester in a poisonous stew of poverty, drugs and crime, it has degenerated into a war zone so dangerous that visitors from outside risk being shot to death.

VMaybe the most telling fact in this coming Israeli election is that at this moment of intense crisis, a tiny Israeli party, Green Leaf, which advocates the legalization of marijuana, could win one or two seats in the new parliament. Green Leaf's motto might as well be: since every other solution has been tried and failed, why not just get high? I've covered a lot of Israeli elections, but I have never seen one like this. I've never seen the Israeli public less interested in the two major parties -- indeed, in the whole event. The reasons are not hard to discern. The last two years of suicide bombings and collapsed peace have knocked the stuffing out of this place.

VA study of Australian twins appears to bolster the theory that marijuana can lead to harder drugs. The researchers found 311 sets of same-sex twins, including 136 sets of identical twins, in which just one twin had smoked marijuana before age 17. Early marijuana smokers were found to be up to five times more likely to move to harder drugs than were their twins. They were about twice as likely to use opiates like heroin and five times as likely to use hallucinogens like LSD.

VThe Advertising Bowl inside this year's Super Bowl was perhaps the most cinematic ever. So why then did the evening seem more like ''Plan 9 From Outer Space'' than ''Citizen Kane''? One reason may be that Madison Avenue, despite plentiful salutes to familiar films and the liberal use of Hollywood-caliber special effects, seemed to fall short compared with memorable pitches from past Super Sundays. As entertaining and effective as some of the spots were -- FedEx, Budweiser and Pepsi Twist, for example -- it is unlikely any of them will ever be deemed worthy of enshrinement in a Super Bowl Ad Hall of Fame, where the Budweiser lizards and frogs and Nike's ''Air Jordan-Hare Jordan'' spots reside.

V''Corner Wars,'' an urban drama conceived, written and performed with the earnestness and energy of the young, tells an ostensibly representative story about the street-level drug trade in Philadelphia. The content of the script, written by Tim Dowlin, is pretty familiar from television cop shows and movies about gangs, complete with a tragic conclusion involving teenagers with guns. And it takes the sympathetic, admonitory tone of an after-school special toward the excitable tough-talkers whose criminality is as culturally inevitable as, say, surfing is to the beachniks of Malibu. But the show, which is being presented at the 47th Street Theater by the aptly named Theater for a New Generation, does have an originality about it that is worth encouraging. Its depiction of street-corner culture, a strain of hip-hop that is fueled by testosterone competition, feels authentic and new to the stage.

VLeslie Fiedler, the maverick man of letters whose best-known book, ''Love and Death in the American Novel,'' attempted to tear away traditional masks of literary discourse and engage the deeper autobiographical and psychological considerations that might motivate the critic, died on Wednesday at his home in Buffalo. He was 85. ''I have, I admit, a low tolerance for detached chronicling and cool analysis,'' Mr. Fiedler once wrote in a negative book review. ''It is, I suppose, partly my own unregenerate nature. I long for the raised voice, the howl of rage or love.''

VThe Cuban government has announced a crackdown on vice, acknowledging that the country not only has a problem with drug use, but also with domestic production. The campaign was announced this week in Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, which said that those found guilty of using, selling or growing drugs would lose their homes, among other penalties. The government decree also singled out prostitution and other antisocial offenses. The decree is the first public acknowledgment that some farmers were growing marijuana in the countryside. Although the government has always maintained that domestic drug use is lower than in surrounding islands, it has grown in recent years, at least partly because of Cuba's increased flow of tourists. Similarly, prostitution has flourished in recent years, catering to Europeans and other tourists. David Gonzalez (NYT)

VA federal jury today found the author of marijuana books and advice columns, Ed Rosenthal, guilty of marijuana cultivation and conspiracy. Under mandatory sentencing laws, Mr. Rosenthal faces a minimum of five years in prison. Mr. Rosenthal, 58, who admitted to growing the plants for distribution under California's medicinal marijuana law, known as Proposition 215, called the verdict a ''terrible decision'' and vowed to fight it. His lawyers said they would prepare motions for a new trial immediately.

VIf there is anything that could render the recent drowning of four teenagers off City Island even more tragic and shocking, it is recollections by family and friends of the boys as sensible and intelligent and often prudent. The boys, who have not been found, are believed to have set off in a rowboat for nearby Hart Island on Jan. 24 after attending a party. They placed a frantic 12-second call to 911 saying their boat was taking on water, and it presumably sank.

VAdministration officials annoyed at California's support of the medical use of marijuana have found someone on whom to vent their frustration. Last week, at the urging of federal prosecutors, a judge convicted Ed Rosenthal of charges that carry a five-year minimum sentence. Mr. Rosenthal is a medical-marijuana advocate who grows the drug for use by the seriously ill. His harsh punishment shows that the misguided federal war on medical marijuana has now escalated out of control. Mr. Rosenthal, who raised marijuana in an Oakland warehouse, was acting within state and local law. California's Proposition 215, which voters approved in a 1996 referendum, permits marijuana use by seriously ill people. In addition, Oakland has its own medical marijuana law, and Mr. Rosenthal was acting as an officer of the city. Nevertheless, the judge refused to allow the defense to mention any of this at his trial, since it is not a valid defense against federal drug charges.

The jurors said they had been unaware that the defendant, Ed Rosenthal, was growing marijuana for medicinal purposes, allowed since 1996 under California state law, when they convicted him on three federal counts of cultivation and conspiracy. He is to be sentenced in June and faces a minimum of five years in prison.

VAttorney General John Ashcroft has ordered United States attorneys in New York and Connecticut to seek the death penalty for a dozen defendants in cases in which prosecutors had recommended against or did not ask for capital punishment, according to lawyers who follow the issue. Those are nearly half of all the cases nationwide in which Mr. Ashcroft has rejected prosecutors' recommendations in a death penalty case. Mr. Ashcroft's decision to reject the confidential recommendations of the federal prosecutors for 10 defendants in New York and 2 in Connecticut is part of an aggressive effort to assure nationwide consistency in decisions to seek the federal death penalty, federal officials say.

VVAIL is unarguably one of the world's greatest ski mountains: a stunningly beautiful 5,289 acres surrounded by glistening snow-capped peaks in the White River National Forest. The town of Vail, however, is sometimes derided as a prefab ersatz Bavarian alpine village, more Epcot than Colorado Rockies. It doesn't have the authentic Victorian architectural bones of old mining towns like Telluride or Crested Butte. But a nascent cool scene is developing. Snowboarders are helping to raise the hip factor, as does the recent influx of Gen-X-Y-Z-ers from New Zealand, Argentina and Australia who work as waiters, ski-tuners and sales clerks. Endless Summer, the search for the perfect wave, has given way to Endless Winter, the quest for the perfect run. MARY BILLARD

VConfronting America's countdown to war, throngs of chanting, placard-waving demonstrators converged on New York and scores of cities across the United States, Europe and Asia yesterday in a global daisy chain of largely peaceful protests against the Bush administration's threatened invasion of Iraq. Three years after vast crowds turned out around the world to celebrate the new millennium, millions gathered again yesterday in a darker mood of impending conflict, forming a patchwork of demonstrations that together, organizers said, made up the largest, most diverse peace protest since the Vietnam War.

VWHETHER discussing terrorist threats, the importance of religious faith in public life or the role the death penalty should play in American justice, Attorney General John Ashcroft seems informed by a moral certainty not often associated with lawyers. He has, for instance, recently overruled the recommendations of local federal prosecutors in 28 cases where they decided not to seek the death penalty. He has similarly used federal prosecutions to override state laws concerning social issues like medicinal marijuana and doctor-assisted suicide.

VJustice Department under Atty Gen John Ashcroft is centralizing power in Washington that his predecessor, Janet Reno, let flow to field offices; he has compared himself Robert F Kennedy, who said he would arrest a mobster for 'spitting on the sidewalk,' taking a similarly aggressive stand on preventing future terror attacks (M)

VAs the Yankees spent their winter signing top international players, the Mets enacted a plan modeled on the Yankees, but not as glamorous. Before Fred Wilpon took over as principal owner in August, he and his son Jeff, the team's chief operating officer, spoke of the need to improve the Mets' character, beginning with the clubhouse. Then, seemingly one by one, the Mets pursued people known throughout baseball as being not only talented but also having a professionalism associated with winners.

VAn uncomplicated life of middle-class sobriety had suited Stan Phillips just fine. That is, until yesterday morning, when Mr. Phillips, a 57-year-old airline purser and fitness enthusiast, stepped off a bus from rural Connecticut and found himself amid a throng of strangers clamoring for peace. Stomping his feet against the cold, his headband emblazoned with wry antiwar slogans, Mr. Phillips said he was pleasantly surprised by his transformation into a placard-hoisting peacenik.

VDuring the first half of a mid-January game against the Dallas Mavericks, Chris Webber receives the ball in the low post and is immediately double-teamed by the Mavs' lanky giants, Dirk Nowitzki and Shawn Bradley. Webber briefly rests his weight on his heels; then he goes dervish. For a nanosecond, he's all dark coil, spinning left and throwing down a yowling reverse slam. As he backs down the court mantled in the din of 17,000 fans, his Michelangelo arms, so long and disproportionate they create a beauty all their own, hang veined and muscled by his sides. A five-time All-Star, Webber is playing better than at any point in his career. He is a candidate for M.V.P. His team is a favorite to win the N.B.A. title. And Webber talks about how now, both on and off the court in Sacramento, he is finally settled and happy. Which is odd, because as Webber is playing such transcendent basketball, federal prosecutors in Detroit have charged him with four counts of making false statements to a grand jury, claiming he lied about receiving cash and gifts while in college. He has also been charged with one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. Each charge carries a possible penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

VOn a recent Friday night, cars began arriving at Healing Place, a megachurch on the outskirts of town that from the road looks more like a big-box retail store than a place of worship. Into the sanctuary of the church trickled nearly 100 men and women, carrying Bibles, avoiding eye contact and hoping for liberation from the addictions crippling their lives. A Christian rock band belted out a set of love songs focusing on Jesus, then a woman in a crisply pressed white shirt took up a cordless microphone and began to preach a mix of scripture and self-help.

VDrug treatment professionals welcome Pres Bush's proposal to spend $600 million on drug programs over next three years to help 300,000 more addicts get treatment, but they question why he chose to single out Set Free Indeed program in Baton Rouge for praise in his State of Union address; say it is religiously sectarian, unlicensed, untested and not clinical in its methods; even founders, Tonja Myles and her husband, Darren, acknowledge that Set Free Indeed is neither recovery program nor drug treatment center, but ministry; money from Bush's drug treatment initiative would go toward vouchers that would be given to addicts to pay for treatment at any program that states deem effective, including religious programs; photo (M)

VThe trip began with such promise, as the Knicks edged Phoenix in a thriller and dropped the Los Angeles Lakers on the strength of Allan Houston's 53-point masterpiece. With two of the final four opponents on this six-game Western swing being the struggling Seattle Supersonics and the so-so Golden State Warriors, the Knicks might have expected to return to New York triumphantly and in prime playoff-challenging position. Instead, they have plummeted, losing three straight games, including one Friday to Golden State, blowing a 9-point lead while being outscored, 24-11, over the last six and a half minutes.

VOn a Friday night in Manhattan, with the temperature dropping and the lights of Times Square blurred by drizzle, 52 young people fanned out on the streets of Midtown, looking for trouble. They looked for expired inspection stickers, open beer bottles, double-parked cars and drunks. They prayed for a fight to break out among the crowds on 42nd Street. They were rookie police officers, tugging at their heavy gun belts, hoping for their first arrest.

VFor the first time, a comprehensive anti-drug code has been adopted for international sports. It covers all Olympic sports, the federations that govern them and all their athletes. The code, adopted yesterday in Copenhagen, does not apply to America's professional leagues in football, baseball, basketball and hockey because they are not under government control. But athletes from the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League who take part in the Olympics and certain other international competitions are subject to the code. That means they will face random drug testing, unannounced and out of competition.

VTom Glavine arrived in the Mets' clubhouse at 8:30 this morning, ready to prepare for his start in this afternoon's exhibition game. Twenty minutes later, Glavine learned his pregame routine would include submitting a urine sample as part of the first phase of steroid testing under the new collective bargaining agreement. Glavine, the National League player representative during negotiations last summer between the owners and the players association, shrugged his shoulders later today and joked that maybe he should make testing a habit since he had just thrown three shutout innings against the Detroit Tigers. Although mandatory drug testing in baseball is a new process and for now carries no penalties, Glavine said players are obligated to do it and perhaps have something to gain.

VQ: You've said that your band's new album, ''Elephant,'' is about the ''death of the sweetheart.'' What does that mean? JACK WHITE: The sweetheart, the gentleman -- it's the same thing. These ideas seem to be in decline, and I hate it. You look at your average teenager with the body piercings and the tattoos. You have white kids going around talking in ghetto accents because they think that makes them hard. It's so cool to be hard. We're against that.

VYanier Moore walked up the concrete steps of one of the hulking brick buildings of the Ida B. Wells housing project, the same steps where he was critically wounded in a drug-related shooting five years ago. The bullet that ripped through his groin, severing an artery, is still lodged in his right leg. He was hustling drugs in the project back then, resigned to the idea that he had no other prospects. Now, making one of his regular visits to his old neighborhood on a gray, wintry afternoon, he was giving away copies of his book, ''Triple Take,'' the ghetto crime novel he says he wrote between drug sales on a Brother word processor he traded for four bags of crack. His buddies began approaching, climbing out of cars and appearing from around corners and out of doorways.

VIn the bureaucratic reshuffling over domestic security, Attorney General John Ashcroft came out a winner. Mr. Ashcroft grabbed control of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and with it an issue dear to his conservative agenda, guns. And he shucked responsibility for two areas of law enforcement that had brought ridicule to the Justice Department, the color-coded threat alert system and immigration. In recent months, Mr. Ashcroft, once regarded as a peripheral, even clumsy, player in the Bush administration, has not only honed his skills as a bureaucratic infighter, he has also patched his tenuous relations with President Bush, who told Mr. Ashcroft last month that he was doing ''a fabulous job.''

As soldiers, armed with assault rifles, took up positions around the littered playground, dozens of mothers and grandmothers emerged from tumbledown houses and walked to the school assembly hall.

VBig commercial traffic jams subsided over the last two days after snarling United States border crossings with Canada and Mexico much of the week as security and law enforcement officers of the three countries raised their guard against possible terrorist infiltrators. Lines of southbound trucks full of Canadian auto parts, paper products and other merchandise began to grow Tuesday night to two hours -- four times the normal average -- at the Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, the most crucial point in a trade relationship valued at $1.3 billion a day for both countries.

VThree Long Island teenagers were arraigned yesterday in connection with a credit card scheme in which more than $100,000 was stolen from over 1,000 bank accounts in the last year, the Nassau County police said. The arrests were made Monday, after the police saw Eric Slutsky, 18, of Jericho, acting suspiciously at a bank machine at a 7-11 store on South Broadway in Hicksville, N.Y., the authorities said. As the officers spoke to Mr. Slutsky at his car, they saw what they said appeared to be marijuana, pills and several credit cards with Post-it notes containing personal identification numbers.

VThe man who helped devise a new uniform standard for banned substances and drug testing in all Olympic sports says he plans to ask North America's four major professional sports leagues why they have not signed on to the new regulations. Dick Pound, the chief executive of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the organization that devised the comprehensive code, said he intended to contact the commissioners of Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League to ask them to adopt the new guidelines and penalties, which include a fixed, two-year suspension for steroid use.

VEven in the experimental days of the 1970's, PCP was a drug that quickly became known for its extremely poor ratio of potential fun to potential risk. Reports of people who leapt from windows, drowned themselves in swimming pools, and committed random murders while under its influence deterred even hard-core drug users, and PCP, known as angel dust, became something to avoid. But it never disappeared entirely, and last weekend when Larme Price, 30, was arrested on charges of fatally shooting four men in bodegas and other small businesses in Brooklyn and Queens in February and March, the police said he told them he had been using PCP, or phencyline, which, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, was developed as an anesthetic in the 1950's.

Her hands stuffed with wads of paper, Ms. Snider was feeding a small shredding machine mounted on a plastic wastebasket. First to be sliced by the electronic teeth were several pink sheets with handwritten requests to the reference desk. One asked for the origin of the expression ''to cost an arm and a leg.'' Another sought the address of a collection agency.

VThe move was something out of Julius Erving's bag of tricks, the kind of play fans at Madison Square Garden would love to see regularly. In the second quarter of the Clippers' 109-98 victory over the Knicks on Saturday night in Los Angeles, Lamar Odom drove along the baseline and scored on a swooping finger roll six feet from the basket while being fouled. That move came moments after he made a 3-pointer. Odom then blocked a dunk attempt by Shandon Anderson just before halftime.

The death toll -- equal to that of the carnage in East Timor in 1999 -- has drawn outrage from local and foreign human rights groups. It seems particularly shocking in a country where democracy has replaced the coups and strongman rule of past decades.

Derek Bailey, a British guitarist, hates to play the same thing twice. His improvisations are taut and thorny -- a cluster here, a run there -- with the concentrated tension that comes from turning every instant of a performance into a moment of decision. His collaborators this weekend should loosen him up. His duet partner tonight is the irrepressible Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista; tomorrow he is paired with the Shaking Ray Levis, a drums and electronics duo from Chattanooga, Tenn. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 9:30; admission is $12 (Jon Pareles).

VState and federal authorities arrested 42 police officers in Ecatepec, on the outskirts of Mexico City, in connection with sales of drugs to schoolchildren, government officials said. The officers were charged with selling marijuana and cocaine to students at elementary and high schools. The arrests came after an eight-month investigation prompted by complaints from parents.

VMARCUS OLIVER and Marcus Gallegos, both 20, run ''garage sales'' out of a small warehouse in the Mission District of San Francisco. They canvass the neighborhood for damaged household goods, used furniture to restore and toys to repair. They post fliers and take out small ads in community newspapers, looking for basements to clean out and overstuffed garages. ''We grab anything we can sell,'' Mr. Oliver says. In the last two years, they have held more than 40 sales, earning $100 to $200 each time. Before, when the young men made money, somebody usually got hurt. The thrift sales represent the first legitimate income of their young lives -- with six years spent in and out of correctional centers for robbery, assault, drug trafficking and parole violations. The Marcuses, as friends refer to them, met at Log Cabin Ranch, a desolate, cinder-block youth detention facility high in the La Honda foothills, 60 miles south of the city. Mr. Gallegos was serving eight months, Mr. Oliver nearly two years.

VFinally, a show that parents can watch with their children's probation officer. UPN's ''Platinum,'' which begins tonight, is the first prime-time drama set entirely in the hip-hop music scene. The saga follows two up-from-the-hood brothers, Jackson and Grady Rhames, as they battle the grimy-glamorous rap demimonde to preserve their independent record label, Sweetback Entertainment.

VThe Detroit Pistons clinched the No. 1 seeding in the Eastern Conference playoffs last night, escaping with an 89-88 victory over visiting Cleveland when Smush Parker's dunk attempt bounced off the back rim as time expired. The victory, combined with the Nets' loss to New Orleans, ensures that Detroit will finish with the top spot in the conference. The Pistons have a one-game lead over the Nets with one game remaining, but Detroit owns the tie breaker.

VThe six men in red jackets onstage at the Hammerstein Ballroom on Friday night were hit makers who never became showmen. They were the Funk Brothers, the surviving members of the Motown Records studio band from 1965 to 1972, and they were accepting the spotlight three decades after the world first danced to their music. Following through on the documentary and soundtrack album ''Standing in the Shadows of Motown,'' the Funk Brothers were seizing their moment at the center of a band recreating their old arrangements. Their guests, Maxi Priest, Joan Osborne and Darlene Love, sang in place of Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Mary Wells and others, and the Funk Brothers' backup singers, Carla Benson, John Ingram and Delbert Nelson, also took leads once sung by Diana Ross or the Temptations.

VA New Haven police lieutenant was arrested yesterday after officers executing a search warrant found a pound and a half of marijuana in the apartment she shared with her boyfriend, the authorities said. The officer, Sonia Atkinson, lived in a second-floor apartment on Mead Street with her boyfriend, Hector Ruiz, said Lt. Patrick Redding, the officer in charge of internal affairs for the New Haven Police Department. Lieutenant Redding said that the authorities believe Mr. Ruiz was dealing drugs out of the apartment, but under state statutes Lieutenant Atkinson can also be charged.

VA 23-year-old fugitive sought in the fatal shooting of one New Jersey police officer and the wounding of another in Bergen County last week was killed in a gun battle with sheriffs' deputies on a sunbaked highway in Florida yesterday after a gunfire-punctuated high-speed chase through two counties, the authorities said. Three days after Officer Mary Ann Collura was shot dead in Fair Lawn as she went to the aid of the other officer, the hunt for the suspect, Omar Marti, an unemployed printer from Passaic, ended 900 miles away near a hamlet 60 miles northeast of Tampa.

VEVERY two years, one imagines art critics rubbing their hands together and licking their chops as they prepare to participate in what has become a venerable tradition: bashing the Whitney Museum of American Art's Biennial. No matter that the artists have included Georgia O'Keeffe, Edward Hopper and Jackson Pollock. The Biennial -- this ''sinking ship,'' this ''train wreck with survivors,'' this ''Gallup poll,'' this ''barometer of stormy weather,'' to quote a few of the gentler descriptions -- has been taken to the woodshed for seven decades, since it began as an annual. Perhaps that's why the event is now held every other year. The next Biennial is not until 2004, but inside the Whitney, the outlook is philosophical. ''It's no pressure at all because everyone expects negative reviews,'' said Debra Singer, a co-curator of the 2004 show. ''We can write them now.''

''She would have been dumbfounded by all the attention,'' said David Boone, a colleague and friend of Officer Collura, a Fair Lawn fixture who lost her life last week as she tried to arrest a small-time drug dealer.

VNO more Sheetrock. That's the big news from the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, where the second edition of the National Design Triennial is now on view. Instead of trying to obliterate the ornate wood interiors of the old Carnegie Mansion with big monochrome panels, the show's organizers have decided to let them be. Begone, white cube. Paul Warwick Thompson, the Cooper-Hewitt's director, says that this nonaggression pact with the past is now official museum policy. In the future, not even vaporous scrims will come between the museum's visitors and its vast expanses of polished oak. It works. For once, the objects on view are not overwhelmed by the aesthetic struggle taking place in the spaces around them. The museum has acquired the serenity to accept what cannot be changed.

VFiction and reality are so seamlessly blended in ''It Runs in the Family,'' a surprisingly complex and subtle portrait of the Grombergs, a high-powered clan of New York lawyers, that the temptation to assume its characters are modeled after the actors playing them is almost irresistible. Four of those actors -- Kirk, Michael, Cameron and Diana Douglas -- are related by birth or by marriage and play fictionalized versions of themselves in the film. Throughout the movie you can feel the actors' offscreen relationships resonating with their performances and enriching them immeasurably. One strand of a story that deftly skips among half a dozen major characters is the strained but loving relationship of the Grombergs' cantankerous patriarch, Mitchell (Kirk Douglas), and Alex (Michael Douglas), his son, who works in the New York law firm his father founded. The two stars have made no secret that their relationship has weathered its share of strife. In the case of the Grombergs, Alex continually grumbles that his hard-bitten father, a feisty, scowling World War II veteran recovering from a stroke (despite a speech impediment, he has ''a few good years left,'' Mitchell's doctor assures him), has never demonstrated his approval or declared his love.

VON a crisp spring morning in the East Village, Dana Beal could envision a future for the Yippies, and it involved coffee and real estate. Mr. Beal, 56, has long white hair and a thick white mustache that give him the look of a character from a Civil War movie. A younger woman who gave her name as War Cry listened as he spoke. Real estate has been his continuing irritation; coffee, he hoped, might be his relief. Since 1973 he has lived in a three-story brick building at 9 Bleecker Street that has functioned as an informal headquarters for some veterans of the Yippie movement, which now continues as a campaign to ease drug policies. But like many remnants of the neighborhood's scruffier past, Mr. Beal found himself on the short end of the real estate boom. Last May he lost his final legal motion to prevent his landlord from selling the building. What he would like, he said, is to set up a foundation to buy the building -- priced at about $1.5 million -- and turn it into a Yippie museum, supported in large part by a coffee bar and a bookstore. ''The Yippies are supposed to come back to New York in 2004,'' Mr. Beal said. ''And this building might not be there for them.''

VA plainclothes narcotics detective shot and killed a Brooklyn man yesterday afternoon minutes after he saw him fatally shoot another man on a crowded Bedford-Stuyvesant street, the police said. It was the second fatal police shooting in Brooklyn in two days, and it sparked a series of tense confrontations through the afternoon between friends of the man killed by the police and officers who were guarding the crime scene. In one instance, several young men stood nose to nose with the officers, their faces contorted in rage, screaming threats and shouting obscenities and later violently kicking the sides of patrol cars. Earlier in the afternoon, shortly after the shooting, wailing and inconsolable relatives of the man, who lived nearby, were hugging police community affairs officers.

VIt's a spot where downshifting 18-wheelers drown out the roar of a nearby rapids; where roadside trash -- coffee cups, fast-food containers and the tread of an occasional blown tire -- litters the narrow fishermen's trail that runs along the riverbank; where getting there isn't half the fun -- it's no fun at all. A friend calls it the ''world's ugliest shad pool.'' The only place comparable is the power-plant pool in Trenton. That spot, a rectangular dead-end canal off the lower Delaware River, attracts the first shad fishers of the season -- hard-core anglers who don't let things like piles of coal and belching smokestacks distract them from casting their darts and spoons. I fished there once years ago from Jim Leedom's boat. We would cast toward shore into a steaming plume of warm water. By day's end, we brushed a fine layer of coal dust from the boat's deck, and our shoulders.

Only about 200 people showed up yesterday for the annual march down Broadway, from Houston Street to Battery Park, to demonstrate in favor of decriminalization of marijuana possession. That is down from a crowd estimated at 6,000 last year. In 2000, the number of arrests at the event, 312, actually exceeded the total turnout this year.

VStephen Glass, who was fired by The New Republic five years ago for fabricating details in 27 articles, has written a book telling his side of the story in fictional form. His publisher, Simon & Schuster, has kept the project a closely guarded secret. The company sold the book to stores without revealing its title or its author. Instead Simon & Schuster sent a letter to bookstores describing the novel as ''a rollicking, riveting tour de force that does for the media business what 'Primary Colors' did for politics,'' a reference to the best-selling roman  clef about President Bill Clinton whose author later was revealed to be Joe Klein.

The court also upheld a drug charge against the man, Osman Petmezci, who was arrested last September after the police found gunpowder, chemicals, six metal pipes and a poster of Osama bin Laden in his apartment. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail by the Heidelberg state court.

VAn activist seeking the overturn of Canada's marijuana law said he smoked hashish and marijuana before arguing his case in the Supreme Court. ''I took a couple hits off some bubble hash and a little bit of cannabis,'' David Malmo-Levine told reporters after delivering a 40-minute monologue to the nine justices. ''I was happy, hungry and relaxed, but I was not impaired.'' The justices declined to question Mr. Malmo-Levine despite his pleas to ''hammer away.'' He argued that a preference for marijuana is a ''substance orientation'' and that just as the court had created a prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, he should receive similar protection. ''For the vast section of people all over the world who have an innate feeling deep down inside they should have a right to self-medicate and control their own minds, you'll be heroes,'' he told the court.

VAs the Mets continued to take a lighthearted approach to what has developed as the clubhouse haircut issue, a far more serious development was unfolding in their clubhouse. Mo Vaughn stood by his locker at Shea Stadium yesterday and indicated that he was likely to have surgery on his deteriorating left knee. An exam on Tuesday concluded that the knee was riddled with perhaps a dozen spurs from bone rubbing on bone. Vaughn will send copies of his tests to William Morgan and Arthur Pappas, the current and former doctors for Vaughn's first team, the Boston Red Sox, and to Lewis Yocum, the physician for the Anaheim Angels, Vaughn's team before he joined the Mets for 2002.

VJoe Quaglio, a 17-year-old from the suburbs who acts like he grew up in the ghetto, is standing in front of his peers, 15 teenage boys, throwing his old life away. Newspaper clippings about old friends, one shot in a drug deal, one serving 30 years in jail, flutter out of his hands and into the trash. Out goes an old journal. Out go the Chuck Taylor sneakers and an old gang bandana.

VDrug testing in schools does not deter student drug use any more than doing no screening at all, the first large-scale national study on the subject has found. The United States Supreme Court has twice empowered schools to test for drugs -- first among student athletes in 1995, then for those in other extracurricular activities last year. Both times, it cited the role that screening plays in combating substance abuse as a rationale for impinging on whatever privacy rights students might have.

VTHE sky was nearly cloudless on Aug. 19, 1960, when Capt. Harold E. Mitchell took off from Hawaii in his stubby C-119 Flying Boxcar. A short time later, in the blackness of space, an orbiting satellite ejected a small film capsule that tumbled earthward protected by a heat shield. When it reached the lower atmosphere, a parachute deployed, and it began a slow descent over the South Pacific. Then, like an outfielder catching a pop fly, Captain Mitchell snagged the falling object -- on his third try -- in a trapeze-like contraption on the nose of his plane. In that instant, satellite espionage was born. Inside the capsule were thousands of images of Soviet territory never before seen by American intelligence.

VTHE CADENCE OF GRASS, by Thomas McGuane. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) In his first novel in 10 years, McGuane zeroes in again on characters responding with comically awful behavior to a hostile but also zany universe. This time his fecklessly nihilistic hero is out to cash in on his former father-in-law's infernal will by reuniting with his estranged ex-wife and managing the family business. With copious detours and one-liners, ''a lot of what happens in this novel is funny or deftly described, no matter how irrelevant or inconsequential,'' Paul Gray wrote in these pages in 2002. A VISIT TO DON OTAVIO: A Traveller's Tale From Mexico, by Sybille Bedford. (Counterpoint, $16.) First published in 1953 in slightly different form as ''The Sudden View: A Mexican Journey,'' this unclassifiable book recounts Bedford's first visit to Mexico, merging an Englishwoman's intensely personal story with cleareyed description of a beautiful, squalid and unfamiliar culture. ''She extracts the very essence of rural and small-town Mexicans,'' Virginia Lee Warren said here in 1954. ''They absolutely live.'' THE HORNED MAN, by James Lasdun. (Norton, $13.95.) Steeped in gender paranoia and the psychology of self-policing, this thriller follows the unraveling of a member of a college sexual harassment committee who lives in terror that a single misstep might brand him a criminal. ''Spookily hilarious and dark as a rabbit warren,'' the book ''combines a narcotic literary ease with a knuckle-whitening tension,'' Emily Nussbaum wrote in these pages last year. SHAKEY: Neil Young's Biography, by Jimmy McDonough. (Anchor, $16.95.) This portrait of the durable rock icon's complicated life and times tracks Young from his childhood in Canada (where he survived polio) to his musical ascent with Buffalo Springfield to his tempestuous years with Crosby, Stills and Nash and with the garage-rock specialists Crazy Horse, and to his re-emergence in the 1990's. The result is an ''exhaustive, quarrelsome and sometimes maddening biography,'' Rick Moody said here last year. Nonetheless, ''there are revelations in abundance.'' THE CELL: Inside the 9/11 Plot, and Why the FBI and CIA Failed to Stop It, by John Miller and Michael Stone, with Chris Mitchell. (Hyperion, $13.95.) According to this gritty police procedural, New York City detectives and ill-equipped American law-enforcement agencies were on the case of Islamic terrorists even before the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. '' 'The Cell' crackles like a police radio'' and is a ''frisky but important addition to the growing literature on Al Qaeda,'' Jeff Stein wrote here in 2002. REVENGE, by Stephen Fry. (Random House, $12.95.) In this modern-day recasting of the Dumas classic ''The Count of Monte Cristo,'' the Edmond Dants figure is a seemingly charmed 17-year-old English public school student who is framed for marijuana possession, and whose woes continue when he is implicated in an I.R.A. scheme and sent off to an insane asylum. Fry, a comic actor, has written ''both a highly readable thriller and a viable novel in its own right,'' Brooke Allen said here last year. AFTER THE QUAKE: Stories, by Haruki Murakami. (Vintage International, $11.) Even though they were written before Sept. 11, 2001, these six stories about the emotional aftershocks of the lethal 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan, will resonate with many American readers as a metaphor for the terrorist attacks. Last year our reviewer, Jeff Giles, found this an ''unexpectedly powerful'' collection about a traumatizing shock to the Japanese system. In fact, he added, ''one sliver of what makes the book so moving is the sense that on some level it is Murakami's deeply felt get-well card'' to the United States. DOT.CON: How America Lost Its Mind and Money in the Internet Era, by John Cassidy. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) This history of the dot-com bubble, by a financial writer for The New Yorker, takes Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to task as something of a free market ideologue. Last year our reviewer, Hugo Lindgren, found it a mostly familiar rehash of the Internet age, but said it ''succeeds quite nicely'' in a few areas. IN RAINBOW'S END: The Crash of 1929, by Maury Klein (Oxford University, $16.95), a historian tells of a time when prosperity spawned optimism, which led in turn to euphoria and finally a speculative frenzy and market manipulation. Sound familiar? His account is ''well written, entertaining and detailed,'' Robert J. Samuelson wrote here in 2001. Scott Veale

VIn the heart of the Downtown Eastside, where the back alleys are shooting galleries for heroin junkies using dirty needles, a long-abandoned storefront recently reopened with a handmade sign out front showing a clenched fist clutching a syringe and the words ''Safer Injection Site.'' In the last three weeks, up to 25 drug users have come here every night to shoot heroin and cocaine into their veins. They are supervised by a registered nurse, who dispenses fresh needles, swabs, sterile water to cook the drugs and advice on how to maintain veins.

VGov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. signed into law a measure that reduces the maximum penalty for medicinal marijuana use to a $100 fine. Mr. Ehrlich, a Republican, signed the measure despite opposition from the Bush administration. The law applies to those who can prove that they smoked marijuana out of medical necessity. For others, marijuana possession carries a maximum penalty of a year's imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Gary Gately (NYT)

VThe Giants' Keith Hamilton talked optimistically this spring about his comeback from a torn Achilles' tendon, saying he intended to dedicate his performance in the 2003 season to the memory of his youngest sister, who was killed in a car wreck last winter. But Hamilton's return is in doubt, after his arrest on drug and alcohol charges early Thursday morning on Route 287 in Morris County, N.J. Hamilton, who turns 32 tomorrow and is projected to be the team's starting right defensive tackle, faces a possible suspension and fine by the National Football League.

An asterisk (*) indicates that a book's sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A dagger (+) indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders. Expanded rankings are available at The New York Times on the Web: nytimes.com/books. Best-seller lists for children's picture books, children's chapter books and children's paperbacks, respectively, are published in rotation on succeeding weeks; all three lists appear each week on the Book Review's Web site. Publishers have provided the age designations for their best-selling children's titles. Rankings for children's paperbacks do not include serials.

VThe Canadian government introduced legislation today to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana but set stricter penalties for trafficking the drug. After more than a year of internal debate on how to change marijuana laws, the final legislation was a compromise between those in the cabinet who see the drug as a minor nuisance and those who fear that anything approaching legalization would encourage use by young people.

VCalifornia's attorney general has urged a federal judge to be lenient when he sentences a man who was authorized by the City of Oakland to grow marijuana for medical use and was then convicted on marijuana cultivation charges. The man, Ed Rosenthal, 58, says he legally grew marijuana for medical use under a 1996 law approved by California voters, but Judge Charles Breyer of Federal District Court here refused to allow a jury to hear that defense.

VJets defensive tackle Josh Evans has tested positive for marijuana use, according to three people familiar with the results of a test administered by the National Football League. Evans adamantly denied any violation yesterday and has appealed the results of the test. If the appeal fails, N.F.L. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will determine his punishment, which could range from a short suspension to a lifetime ban. Evans has been suspended twice before -- for four games in 1999 and for the 2000 season -- for violations of the N.F.L.'s substance-abuse policy. The result of his appeal could come within days.

VI had car trouble in West Virginia once. The experience (some nice people in a trailer let us use their telephone to call Hertz) was not as eventful as that of the attractive young characters in Rob Schmidt's ''Wrong Turn,'' but it was also a lot less tedious. Mr. Schmidt's lazy would-be horror film stars Desmond Harrington as Chris, a young professional who runs into a traffic jam on his way to an important interview in Raleigh, N.C. His cellphone doesn't work here, in what the movie identifies as Greenbrier Backcountry, W.Va., and neither does the telephone at the nearest gas station, which is attended by a filthy, grizzled, almost toothless old man who seems overwhelmed by a lifetime of inertia. So Chris takes a look at a map and decides to take a back road.

VEd Rosenthal, a medical marijuana advocate, is to be sentenced next week on marijuana cultivation charges. His conviction, by a California jury that was made to believe he was a common drug trafficker, was a miscarriage of justice. A federal judge may now be on the verge of compounding the wrong by sentencing Mr. Rosenthal to prison. Growing marijuana for medical use is legal under the California Compassionate Use Act, passed by the voters in 1996, and Mr. Rosenthal was authorized by the city of Oakland to grow medical marijuana. But federal law does not distinguish between growing medical marijuana and run-of-the-mill drug cultivation. At Mr. Rosenthal's trial, Judge Charles Breyer prohibited the jury from hearing a medical-marijuana defense.

The team and Evans, who adamantly denied on Thursday that he had used marijuana, declined comment on the situation today in accordance with advice from the National Football League. ''I can't talk about it,'' Evans said as he left the field after practice. ''They told me not to talk about it.''

VMonth after month, dozens of teenage foster children in New Jersey remain locked up in the state's array of secure juvenile detention centers -- often, child welfare officials admit, because there is simply a lack of more appropriate places to put them, and often while officials skirt state laws meant to limit how long children can be held in such places. Some of the adolescents, ranging in age from 11 to 18, are guilty of nothing more than violating court orders prohibiting them from skipping school or running away from their homes. Others who have committed minor crimes like marijuana possession or shoplifting, and who would be released quickly if there were available foster families or group homes to take them in, remain locked up for months alongside young people awaiting trial for arson, sexual assault and murder. It is a problem that states across the nation face.

VMANY busy parents tend to go first to the Internet when looking for resources for raising their children, but that doesn't mean that they always like what they find. Zyg Furmaniuk, a software consultant from Belmont, Mass., who has two school-age daughters, recalled the difficulty he had a few years ago finding reliable information to help one of them, Bacall, now 11, who was having trouble reading. A seemingly simple online search, he said, turned up mountains of contradictory information and opinions. A doctor eventually diagnosed dyslexia.

Mr. Rudolph, who had vanished into the thick forests of Appalachia, living off a mix of wild berries, tuna fish and help from sympathetic local residents, surfaced here in the very corner of rural North Carolina where the search began five years ago.

VLAST week, Canada's governing Liberal Party introduced a bill that would decriminalize the possession of up to 15 grams of marijuana. ''Cannabis consumption is first and foremost a health matter,'' Justice Minister Martin Couchon declared. ''It should not result in criminal penalties.'' Under the new plan, a minor pot offense would be punished with a citation and a fine, much like a speeding ticket. The bill is strongly opposed by the Bush administration, which has threatened to step up drug searches at the border, creating traffic jams and delaying Canadian exports. ''It is my job to protect Americans from dangerous threats,'' John P. Walters, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, warned last year, ''and right now, Canada is a dangerous staging area for some of the most dangerous marijuana.''

VNew Jersey's child welfare agency said today that it would re-examine the 2001 death of a boy whose parents were arrested Saturday after another one of their sons drowned in a bathtub. Both boys were 19 months old when they died. The parents, Jack and Megan Manookian, were charged with child endangerment after their son Christian drowned on Friday. The authorities said the toddler was left unsupervised in the tub with his 5-year-old sister, Cheyenne. The couple were also charged with weapons and drug offenses after the police found heroin, marijuana and guns in their olive-colored house on Franklin Avenue.

VYears before a first and then a second young son of a New Jersey man were found dead in the family's home, the state's child welfare agency investigated three separate allegations that the man had physically abused another boy in the home, agency officials said today. Officials with the Division of Youth and Family Services said that in 1997 and 1998, the agency received three complaints that the man, Jack Manookian, had struck Brian McCarthy Jr., a son of his wife's from a previous relationship, said Ed Rogan, a spokesman for the agency.

VThree people accused of operating a sophisticated marijuana distribution and money-laundering ring on Long Island for more than a decade have been indicted, federal and state officials announced yesterday. Officials said they had confiscated more than two tons of marijuana and nearly $11 million in cash. Warren Hazen, 37, of Manhattan, and his brother Barry Hazen, 36, of Commack, were charged in a federal indictment unsealed last month with participating in a wholesale drug operation. Barry Hazen was released on $1 million bond; his brother remains in custody. A third man, Bruno Arreola-Garcia, is accused of being the intermediary who helped them get marijuana from Mexico. He was arrested in Las Vegas in February, but was freed on $20,000 bond and has since disappeared.

VHIGHLIGHTS ANNALS OF CENSORSHIP: OTHER TIMES -- Banned in Britain when released in 1967, ''The Trip,'' a drug film written by Jack Nicholson and directed by Roger Corman, was approved yesterday by British censors for release. Starring Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, the film told the story of a director of television commercials (Mr. Fonda), who graduated from marijuana use to experimenting with LSD. Reuters reported that the British Board of Film Classification, which originally refused a ratings certificate because of graphic depiction of drug use, said it was changing its stance because the film's portrayal of the hallucinogenic experience was unlikely to convince a modern viewer and because ''The Trip'' showed the drawbacks as well as the pleasure of drug use.

VIT is hard to understand how controversy could swirl around Col. Joseph R. Fuentes, the newest superintendent of New Jersey's State Police. He is the model of decorum, sitting stiffly in a green suit in an office that is so neat it looks as if it passed a military inspection. On his desk is a row of books all on one theme, leadership. There are the framed pictures of the State Police band on the wall, a revolver in a glass case, books celebrating the history of the State Police and a pile of blue folders on his desk that he reads while being driven to and from his home. ''I have been in the State Police 25 years,'' he said, laughing. ''It is the reverse of my age. Unbelievable.''

VTen eighth graders in Mamaroneck, N.Y., were suspended after a group of them were caught drinking at their graduation dance last Friday, school administrators said yesterday. One student was hospitalized overnight for alcohol poisoning. The incident has prompted officials in Westchester County to refocus their campaign against teenage drinking on an even younger group: middle school students.

VEVEN in California, birthplace of the tax revolt and showcase of plebiscitary excess, there has never been an extravaganza like the fight brewing over the recall of Gov. Gray Davis. The political stability of the largest state hangs in the balance. It now seems probable that the effort, dead in the water just two months ago, will gather the requisite 900,000 signatures, perhaps as early as mid-July, and a vote could take place by October. If so, Californians will, for the first time ever, get to decide whether to remove their governor.

VIN the summer of 1956, Jack Kerouac spent 63 days searching for God and forest fires from a monkish lookout high above Ross Lake in the Cascade Mountains in Washington State. For Kerouac, this solo sojourn proved a magnificent, mind-bending experience that he distilled into some of the choicest writing in ''The Dharma Bums'' and ''Desolation Angels.'' A half-century later, latter-day beatniks still arrive in the North Cascades to brush against Kerouac's ghost. Other visitors come simply to play in his backyard, with its cyclorama of saw blade peaks and ''mad raging sunsets'' that remain as unsullied as in his day. Both groups are drawn by the abiding solitude: a clutch of old, floating cabins moored at one end of long Ross Lake remains the only facilities. Thirty miles from the nearest cellphone coverage or espresso stand, you can sit by the water's hem and wrangle with the Big Ideas. Or you can fish, hike and kayak in the heart of the ''American Alps.''

VCanada's decision to allow marriage between same-sex couples is only one of many signs that this once tradition-bound society is undergoing social change at an astonishing rate. Increasingly, Canada has been on a social policy course pursued by many Western European and Scandinavian countries, and over the last few decades it has been moving gradually more out of step with the United States.

VEveryone loves Bob Marley, which may be why so many singers claim him as an inspiration: they're hoping some of that love will rub off on them. Tonight two of his biggest fans, Ben Harper and Jack Johnson, came to Jones Beach Theater here, emulating their hero with mixed results. The headliner was Mr. Harper, a great rock star who isn't. He looks good onstage, lithe and lively in a denim-and-denim outfit, his dance moves as smooth as his Afro. And he looks good on paper: he has a great voice, he is a virtuosic guitarist and he writes idiosyncratic rock songs that draw from reggae and the blues.

An asterisk (*) indicates that a book's sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A dagger (+) indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders. Expanded rankings are available at The New York Times on the Web: nytimes.com/books. Best-seller lists for children's picture books, children's chapter books and children's paperbacks, respectively, are published in rotation on succeeding weeks; all three lists appear each week on the Book Review's Web site. Publishers have provided the age designations for their best-selling children's titles. Rankings for children's paperbacks do not include serials.

Prosecutors and defense lawyers in the murder case both said the woman, Chante J. Mallard, 27, smoked marijuana, took Ecstasy and drank heavily in the hours before she hit Gregory Biggs on a highway in the early hours of Oct. 26, 2001. The defense says it was an accident.

Today, many potters and painters toil in the corners of this tiny community on the slopes of Haleakala volcano on Maui, but when Mr. Faught arrived three decades ago as a teacher, he was the local art scene. ''I won first prize at the county fair,'' said Mr. Faught, a self-described old hippie, with spiky white hair and a platinum stud in each ear. ''No one else entered.''

VMost people will never take an I.Q. test, and if they do, it probably won't have a big impact on them. Generally speaking, I.Q. tests do not carry much weight anymore. Not with vague charges of cultural bias still clinging to them. Not at a time when multiple intelligences -- that happy, inclusive vision in which nearly everybody is good at something -- are on the ascendancy. If you do take a Stanford-Binet or a Wechsler, and you score in the average range, well, there you'll be, with hardly a reason to mention it. If you score high, the particular number won't matter much -- unless you're the sort to join Mensa, and then it will matter only to your fellow Mensa members. But if you are in the bottom 3 percent of the population that scores 70 or lower, your actual I.Q. number will mean a great deal. Scores in that range will most likely lead to a diagnosis of mental retardation, and that diagnosis will entail many things, starting with mandated special education. Since last June, across the United States, it has also entailed exemption from capital punishment. And so, for someone who has committed a capital crime, an I.Q. score can mean the difference, quite literally, between life and death. It can mean, if we want to be blunt about it, that there is such a thing as being too dumb to die, at least at the hands of the state. On June 20, 2002, when the Supreme Court issued a decision declaring execution of the retarded unconstitutional, it surprised even some of the very people who had been working hardest to make that day come about. Asked to rule on the same question in 1989, the justices had reached the opposite conclusion, declaring that while evidence of a defendant's mental retardation ought to be presented as a mitigating factor at sentencing, it did not render him or her ineligible for the death penalty. Now here they were just 13 years later -- not so long in the history of what the court called our ''evolving standards of decency'' -- saying that the world had changed, that Americans were no longer willing to countenance the ultimate punishment for people who by definition could never be as morally culpable as other adults.

VMargaret Talbot article on Supreme Court decision declaring it unconstitutional to execute retarded person; says new element of arbitrariness has been added to death-penalty system that is already arbitrary in many other ways; says now person's score on IQ test can determine life or death; says that in other contexts, intellectual ability and capacity to act morally do not always go together; says to assert that mentally retarded people as a class are less blameworthy for gravest of crimes is to raise some troubling contradictions; notes advocates for mentally retarded are focused on normalization, treating individuals as individuals; quotes Prof Donald Bersoff, psychologist, who worries that accepting concept of blanket incapacity would relegate people with retardation to second-class citizenship, and might potentially permit state to abrogate their exercise of fundamental interests such as right to marry, have and rear children, vote, etc; says even some of public defenders eagerly making use of Supreme Court decision wonder about logic of it; photo (L)

VTen days after the police stormed into his home without warning, a Brooklyn man with a history of heart trouble died yesterday, and a lawyer for his family charged that his death had been caused by officers who had broken in with drawn guns, slapped a child, ransacked the house and ignored pleas for explanations. The police yesterday acknowledged that officers had gone in without warning or a warrant, but said they had done so justifiably in pursuit of a suspect they thought was armed. The suspect, who they said may have been a son of the dead man, apparently escaped through a rear window, the police said.

Holt, who was in the soccer stadium in downtown Monrovia amid a sea of grinning would-be college graduates in shimmering black caps and gowns. Their proud parents clutched camcorders and flowers. The occasion was commencement for the class of 2003 of the African Methodist Episcopal University. About an hour into the program, as Mr. Holt, an economics major, was listening to a guest preacher speak about facing the future, an explosion in the distance announced the first mortars.

VIt had been nearly 10 months since Bobby Gibson had watched a stranger dressed in black ride a bicycle into a Brooklyn schoolyard, draw a gun from his waistband and kill his friend. Now he was ready to walk into a courtroom to testify in the murder case. But on the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the word had been out for months: ''lie or die,'' as one neighborhood girl put it. The half brother of the defendant in the schoolyard shooting, himself a suspect in another slaying, was said to be tracking down witnesses. People said money had changed hands. Eyewitness accounts had been recanted.

VQ: As Canada's best-known political columnist outside Canada, you probably have something to say about the news that a court in Ontario recently legalized same-sex marriages. It's great. There's been a wave of gay weddings in Toronto in just the past few weeks. The American Library Association was in town, so we had 19,000 librarians in Toronto, and some of them were gay Americans who rushed to get married here. City Hall has extended its hours.

VIN a cool twilight mist on the first night of the Fourth of July weekend, seven women -- Lauren, Laurie, Laura, Lisa, Jackie, Monica and Sharon by name -- were perched on bar stools at Flynn's bar here, getting merrily, determinedly drunk. The occasion was a bachelorette party for Lauren Dean, who in eight days would add a diamond to the second finger of her left hand and ditch her old last name to become Lauren Oak. Ms. Dean, a social worker from North Babylon, wore an apron. The apron read, ''I'm the bachelorette, buy me a shot or a drink!''

VAt 2:40 a.m. on Aug. 26, 1998, along a main drag on the west side of Indianapolis, 18-year-old Jeremy Gross approached a convenience store with a friend. They intended to rob it. At 5-foot-8 and of slender build, Gross was not particularly physically imposing, and he had a distant look about him. He wore his blond hair in a bowl cut and often seemed nervous and fidgety. He knew the store well, since he worked there part time, and he also knew the young man, Christopher Beers, who was the lone clerk that morning. Beers, who was 24, had been raised by his father and had completed one year at Purdue University before running out of money for tuition. He was overweight and, according to his uncle, mild-mannered. He was working to earn money to return to school. An avid reader, he welcomed the graveyard shift; it gave him time with his books. Gross stood outside the glass doors, behind his accomplice, Joshua Spears. He held a small, black semiautomatic pistol at his side, out of sight. Gross was jumpy, turning his head from side to side to make sure no one was in the parking lot. Beers buzzed them in. Gross took long, hurried strides into the store, raised his right arm and started shooting. It happened so quickly that Beers didn't have a chance to say anything. The first shot hit him in the abdomen. Gross continued to fire. Three shots missed, but a fourth hit Beers in the chest. ''Oh, God, please, no,'' he pleaded. As Beers stumbled into the back office, Gross followed and, to get a better angle, shifted the pistol from his right hand to his left. From close range, Gross shot Beers in the face. With blood now gushing from his eyes, Beers reached out for Gross, as if he were asking for support. Gross pushed him away, and he crumpled to the floor. ''Why, Jeremy, why?'' Beers asked. Gross told him to shut up.

VAlex Kotlowitz article examines why 12 pro-death penalty jurors spared life of Jeremy Gross, who, at 18, shot co-worker Christopher Beers in cold blood during robbery at Indianapolis convenience store that netted him $650; says that number of death sentences has dropped, crediting alternative sentence of life without possibility of parole together with increasing skill of defense lawyers; outlines role of mitigation specialists, who search for information about defendants that will help defense lawyer make case against death penalty; says that during sentencing phase of Jeremy Gross's trial, some jurors were so distressed at his childhood that they wondered where parents' responsibility should lie; some jurors who agreed to be interviewed comment on deliberations and process of arriving at life sentence; says some jurors on Gross case are now not as certain of their once-staunch belief in capital punishment; photos (L)

VLooking like a beat poet or a heavy-lidded hustler, in jeans, disintegrating T-shirt and black leather jacket, Adam Guettel surfaces in the rare Seattle sun after a morning at the keyboard, his fingers actually bleeding. ''Lovely, don't you think?'' he asks, holding them up for inspection. He has been struggling to write a complicated new song this week -- also, depending on how you look at it, for three months or four years; four years is how long he's been working on ''The Light in the Piazza,'' a musical based on Elizabeth Spencer's 1960 novella. There's a dramatic hole at the heart of the story, and it needs to be filled soon because the show is about to open in previews. But difficult as the assignment may be, passionate as Guettel's writing process is, that's not what has done the damage to his hands. He's done the damage. With his teeth. Later, indoors, he will demonstrate some of his other nervous habits, which may qualify, he cheerily admits, as obsessive-compulsive tics. ''I don't enjoy turning on or off a light switch without being slightly off the ground,'' he says, hopping on one foot. Then he shows me how pencils and other objects on his desk must be aligned along inscrutable axes only he can perceive. ''And of course I have to put my knee into the corner of a room.'' He does so, and laughs, as if at the antics of a not-quite-funny but tolerated drunk.

VThe Knicks released the roster for their summer league team yesterday, and it was notable more for who was missing than for who was on it. The Knicks had hoped that their two second-round draft picks, Maciej Lampe and Slavko Vranes, would join the summer league team. But neither player was on the roster because each is trying to buy out his contract from his European team.

VThe Canadian government announced an interim plan today that will provide marijuana on a regular basis to several hundred people who are authorized to use the drug for medical reasons. Coming six weeks after the federal government introduced a bill decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana and only days after it approved a trial ''safe injection site'' in Vancouver for intravenous drug users, the marijuana plan was one more sign that Ottawa is moving in a very different direction on drug policy from the Bush administration.

VRAYMOND CARTER'S release from prison followed a familiarly bleak script. After two years at the Wyoming Correctional Facility in upstate New York for sale of a controlled substance, he was granted his freedom on June 23, and given back his personal belongings -- a Social Security card and some medication -- then handed 40 bucks and a one-way bus ticket to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. He had a little time, so he savored a quiet meal at McDonald's. A few hours later he was jostling through the bustle of New York City and the crowds of Midtown. Though uncertain about his job prospects and his future, he was elated. ''You wanted to scream, 'I'm free!' '' he said. A. Alfred Taubman's reintroduction to society went down a little differently. After serving nine-and-a-half months of a year-and-a-day sentence for price-fixing, Mr. Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's, learned on June 13 at a halfway house in Detroit that he was a free man. Mr. Taubman's first move was to order his chauffeur to pick him up posthaste. After a quiet night at home in nearby Bloomfield Hills, Mich., with his wife, Judy, amid their collection of Jackson Pollocks and Kandinskys, Mr. Taubman, boarded his Gulfstream IV and headed straight for his sprawling oceanfront estate in the Hamptons. By evening, he was savoring a meal at Mirko's, an intimate restaurant in Water Mill, at the best table in the house.

VFew people in this scrappy former timber town nestled in the redwoods would disagree that the most famous citizen ever to hail from here was short-legged, knobby-kneed, somewhat scrawny and ill-tempered -- a mud-colored underdog, not unlike Willits itself. That is why, as the premiere of a major motion picture based on the book ''Seabiscuit: An American Legend'' looms, the Willits Chamber of Commerce has recently opened a boutique called All Things Seabiscuit. Why the mayor has issued a proclamation temporarily changing the name of East Commercial Street to Seabiscuit Boulevard. Why the Baechtel Creek Inn and Spa is putting the finishing touches on a new Seabiscuit Room. And why the Mendocino County Museum has installed an exhibit of Seabiscuit memorabilia, including his custom-made leather skullcap -- so he would not hit his head on the overhang of his private rail car -- and a silver-plated horseshoe from the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap on loan from Bob Hope.

VTo ferryboat passengers disembarking onto this forested 53-acre hump of earth two miles off the Connecticut coast, David Graaf is the sun-seared, scruffy-faced dock hand in black Chuck Taylor high-tops waving hello. He may not introduce himself as the man who holds the best $550-a-week job in the New York metropolitan area, but to many, many people he has never met, David Graaf is exactly that. Mr. Graaf, 43, is a lighthouse keeper, Connecticut's only live-in, stay-through-the-storms lighthouse keeper remaining on Long Island Sound.

VFemi Osunla stood quietly before a wall of snapshots at the New Museum in SoHo one evening last week, seemingly unaware of the blaring music and swelling crowd that had gathered around him. Lost in his remembrances, he was staring at pictures of the Nigerian singer and political activist Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, who died in 1997. Some were candid; others were posed. All were taken by Mr. Osunla, a member of Fela's retinue for nearly two decades. ''I have over 15,000 photos of Fela in my archives,'' said Mr. Osunla, whose dedication to documenting Fela's every move earned him the nickname Femi Foto. He then pointed to his missing bottom teeth, the small bump on his forehead, the thin scars that mar his face. Standing on the front lines with Fela in a lifelong battle with oppressive Nigerian regimes was ''not an easy task,'' Mr. Osunla said, ''but I believed in what he was doing.''

VIn the voice-over at the beginning of ''How to Deal,'' Halley, the 16-year-old heroine (Mandy Moore), complains about the frustrations of childhood: having to wear silly hats, not knowing what's in school cafeteria meatballs -- that kind of thing. Before long, these banal concerns will give way to much bigger ones for Halley and the people around her. These include, not quite in order: a divorce, a premature death, an unplanned pregnancy, a tumultuous engagement (of Halley's big sister, cutely played by Mary Catherine Garrison), a car accident, a bad New Year's Eve party, a first kiss and an undeserved grounding. This is quite a lot for one young woman -- or one movie -- to bear. The pileup of significant events in ''How to Deal,'' which opens nationwide today, may be explained by the fact that it has been adapted, by Neena Beber, from two young-adult novels by Sarah Dessen. But this film's hectic, unwieldy plot, and the way it treats all of the occurrences listed above as more or less equivalent, are reminders that melodrama is the natural mode of adolescence.

VFor days, Russell Simmons had been telling everyone he could that he had struck a deal to revamp New York's mandatory jail sentences under the state's Rockefeller-era drug laws. He mentioned it on NY 1. He told it to foreign journalists. He briefed the Rev. Al Sharpton and anyone else who would listen. ''That's what I do,'' Mr. Simmons, the mogul, said last Tuesday, with the confidence that had made him both successful and rich in the world of hip-hop. ''I'm a deal maker.''

VIT'S not always easy to realize when you're in the presence of genius -- especially when it comes in the form of a muscular 5-foot-7 Nigerian, dressed in leopard-skin bikini underpants, his eyes blurry-red from overindulgence in marijuana, who is ranting on and on about a toothbrush. Not a specific toothbrush, but the very idea -- the concept -- of the toothbrush, which turns out to be a vestige of colonialism, another Western assault on the dignity of Africans. ''Before the white man came, we Africans used sharpened sticks to clean our teeth,'' said Fela, glaring out from the stage. ''I've thrown away my toothbrush. My brothers, we must all throw away our toothbrushes.''

''Anywhere we go, they say place full,'' said Mary Warner, 28, who had run from home early this afternoon with her 4-year-old son on her back. She had pressed against the gates of a United Nations compound today and waited outside a yard owned by the United States Embassy.

VElvis lives -- maybe. But Jimi Hendrix is definitely dead, and has been for 33 years. Even his most devoted fans accept that. Lately, though, it seems that almost everything else about Hendrix -- his image, the circumstances of his death, his message and his legacy -- is open to debate, or else a nasty argument. How would Hendrix feel, for example, about the Jimi Hendrix ''Road Rage'' vanilla-scented car air fresheners sold by the official Jimi Hendrix online store? The golf balls? The boxer shorts?

VThe two new top officials at New Jersey's child-welfare agency said today that caseworkers had followed proper procedures in the case of two South Jersey children who were killed by their father this month. The agency, the Division of Youth and Family Services, was shaken by the killings of Rhiannon Wasserman, 10, and her brother, Michael, 8, by their father, Steven Lee Wasserman. Mr. Wasserman, 44, who also killed his ex-girlfriend and himself, had been the subject of seven complaints of child abuse from 1996 to 2002.

VEven before the Mets lost, 8-5, to the Reds yesterday, tension was swirling through the Mets' clubhouse as catcher Mike Piazza denied a report that said he was unhappy with the team. The Record of Hackensack, N.J., citing two unnamed sources, reported yesterday that Piazza was so displeased with the Mets' direction and their plans to gradually move him to first base that he wanted to be traded, possibly to an American League team so he could catch and be a designated hitter. Tom Glavine, the story suggested, has told ownership that he does not want to have Piazza catch him.

V''If I beat my wife, do I get a discount?'' Brandon Hoffman, of Ozone Park, N.Y., asked of a woman selling sleeveless T-shirts on Thursday at the Lollapalooza Festival in Holmdel, N.J. The $20 shirts, whose vernacular name makes unfortunate offhand reference to spousal abuse, bore the legend Whiteboy and the white boys at Lollapalooza were snapping them up. ''The message of our logo is contrast rather than color, mixing things, blending,'' said Theresa Arias, a representative of the fledgling Whiteboy label, which was started by a Californian, Joe Shortal, in partnership with Jimmy Blondell, a former Washington Redskins nose tackle. The shirts, said Ms. Arias, who operated one of numerous commercial booths at the daylong rock festival, are the first in a series set to include some equally provocative models reading Black Jesus and White Devil.
