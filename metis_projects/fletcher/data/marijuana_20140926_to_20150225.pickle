VEditorial criticizes New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for failing to reduce arrests of black and Latino men for possessing small amounts of marijuana, one of his campaign promises; contends such arrests, often made illegally, put young men at risk of losing jobs, access to housing or eligibility for military service; laments that New York City continues to pursue unfair police practices that disproportionately penalize communities of color and damage lives of young people.

VCloser examination of Ottawa gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's past suggests that he may have embraced religion not as a political cause, but as an attempt to scaffold a disintegrating life; law enforcement authorities have yet to find anyone who assisted Zehaf-Bibeau, and much remains unknown about the assault, which left Cpl Nathan Cirillo dead and three others injured.

VJohn Moffitt, little-known offensive lineman for the Denver Broncos, made national news in 2013 when he abruptly retired, giving up about $1 million in pay; his journey into retirement at 27 has been a cautionary tale of how unprepared some professional athletes, even those with money, four-year college degree and a supportive family, are for life outside the sports bubble.

VEfforts to legalize recreational marijuana were successful in Oregon, Washington, DC, and Alaska, and voters approve legalizing medical marijuana in Florida; people on both sides of issue see victory of marijuana legalization in Alaska, where Republicans control most of the state government, as particularly vivid signal flare about issue as next wave of state voter referendums are being planned.

p27626
VNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is working on new policy for how police handle marijuana cases, his most significant effort yet to address enduring effects of Police Dept's excessive stop-and-frisk practices; during Bloomberg administration, police arrested as many as 50,000 people a year on minor marijuana charges; under new practice, those found with small amounts of the drug would be issued an appearance ticket instead of an arrest.

VEditorial argues that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's new policy to address disproportionate impact of marijuana arrests on blacks and Hispanics is flawed; notes policy does not address fundamental problem of discriminatory policing that primarily affects minorities; observes that shifting marijuana cases to summons system, which does not track identity of the accused by race, will require city to make system more transparent.

VAftermath of grand jury's decision not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson in fatal shooting of black teenager Michael Brown lays bare nation's deep racial divisions over justice system; Pew polls find black mistrust of police and courts is far greater than toward other institutions; blacks and whites play and work together much more than in decades past, but still often go home to worlds apart, despite progress on civil rights.

ssVabstract
p50183
VJudge Herman C Dawson of Prince George\u2019s County, Md, is more likely than other juvenile court judges to incarcerate young offenders, hoping it will teach them a lesson and deter them from committing other crimes; Dawson's critics say he relies too heavily on locking juveniles up, contributing to incarceration rates that are among the highest in the state; also note that studies find juveniles who are imprisoned often become more involved in crime rather than less so.

VNicholas Kristof Op-Ed column reflects on life of his old high school friend Kevin Green, who has died at 54; notes that many might consider Green a moocher, as he survived on disability and food stamps; posits that Green's fate, like many other Americans, was in some part due to nation's trend toward income inequality, and to mostly ignored evidence of existing empathy gap between affluent and non-affluent Americans.

VEditorial commends strides Texas has made in reforming its juvenile justice system following public outcry in 2007 over disclosures of neglect and abuse; contends that key element of success has been reduced use of state prisons for juvenile offenders and increased reliance on local rehabilitation programs; expresses hope that data reflecting Texas's successes will aid it and other states in improving treatment of young criminals.

VWitness, human rights organization that helps train and support amateur journalists around the world, is partnering with Brazilian media collective Papo Reto in project that will test whether amateur journalism can lead to justice in Rio de Janeiros favelas; favelas are notoriously deadly, in no small part due to massive police presence, which many favelados believe makes bringing police brutality cases against offending officers hopeless.
