VA panel of eight men and four women will decide the fate of R. Kelly, the R&B star whose much-delayed trial on child pornography charges is to begin Tuesday in Chicago. During jury selection, which ended Thursday, the defense accused the prosecution of eliminating some African-Americans from the pool of candidates, while the prosecution countered that it had also eliminated some white males, The Chicago Sun-Times reported. The final group of jurors includes an African-American woman married to a Baptist preacher, a young white woman who is an aspiring police officer, a 68-year-old Romanian immigrant and a recent college graduate who was once arrested for marijuana possession. Mr. Kelly was indicted on June 5, 2002, after the appearance of a videotape that prosecutors say shows him having sex with a girl as young as 13. He has pleaded not guilty. On Friday, the judge, Vincent Gaughan, rejected a motion that news organizations have access to sealed court transcripts and records of the case.

VCrown Heights is experiencing racial tensions, as it has every so often since the 1991 unrest that erupted after a 7-year-old black boy was fatally struck by a Hasidic driver. The violence also left a Jewish man dead. The beating of a 20-year-old black college student last month and the robbery and beating of a Jewish teenager last week are the proximate causes of the latest unease.

VHUMPHREY BOGART pursued a priceless statuette in ''The Maltese Falcon.'' Jimmy Stewart stalked a beguiling Kim Novak in ''Vertigo.'' Steve McQueen proved the importance of seat belts in ''Bullitt.'' And Clint Eastwood holstered a handgun only slightly smaller than a howitzer in ''Dirty Harry.'' Maybe it's the fog or those hills tailor-made for careening car chases, but San Francisco is the perfect setting for a good, atmospheric mystery.

VTravel is often a means of escape, and this year's travel books offer plenty of it. Failed relationships, dead-end jobs and other disappointments infest the current crop like bedbugs in a youth hostel, driving their authors around the globe in search of transformation. The seekers range from bored young drifters to anxiety-stricken middle-agers, motivated by the quixotic hope that cutting loose will stimulate the mind and heal the soul. ''I was ready for Paris,'' Bryce Corbett announces at the beginning of A TOWN LIKE PARIS: Falling in Love in the City of Light (Broadway, paper, $12.95). ''Ready for a change of scene and the shedding of some emotional baggage.'' After a breakup with a longtime girlfriend, the 28-year-old Australian quits his job at Sky News in London and boards the Eurostar for a new life. What follows is a refreshing variation on a shopworn theme: the Anglophone at large in the French capital, coping with the language barrier, inaccessible Gallic women and bad plumbing. Corbett finds a job he isn't ''qualified for, much less interested in,'' lands a hideously furnished flat in the Marais and joins a circle of partygoing fellow expatriates, whom he annoyingly calls the ''Paris Posse.'' It's not quite ''A Moveable Feast,'' and the tone can be smugly self-satisfied, but Corbett's sharp observations lend the tale a dash of élan. Lamenting the decline of Shakespeare and Company into a Left Bank tourist trap, he notes that its ''literary credibility'' has ''long since been replaced by the distinct aroma of upper-middle-class America -- a mixture of Snapple Ice Tea, sweaty Teva sandals and Tommy Hilfiger cologne.'' When Corbett abandons his quest for a French girlfriend and falls in love with an Australian nightclub entertainer he calls ''the Showgirl,'' you can't help wishing him bonne chance.

VSeth Rogen and James Franco play stoners in the coming film \u201cPineapple Express,\u201d and they reprised their roles at the MTV Movie Awards on Sunday night: they pulled out a bag of fake marijuana onstage, then Mr. Rogen lighted a fake joint and Mr. Franco puffed on it. \u201cKids don\u2019t really smoke fake weed like this,\u201d Mr. Rogen, above with glasses, told the crowd at the Gibson Amphitheater in Los Angeles, where they were presenting the award for the best summer movie so far. Before television viewers could get a closer look at what was real and what was not, the camera moved to a wide angle and stayed that way until Mr. Rogen and Mr. Franco, above in white T-shirt, left the stage, The Associated Press reported. It was an awkward moment that made some in the audience laugh. Backstage, Mr. Franco told The Associated Press that MTV had put them up to the joke \u2014 supplying the script as well as the fake pot and joint \u2014 and then had a last-second change of heart.

VThe San Francisco medical examiner said a teenager had marijuana and alcohol in his system when he was killed on Dec. 25 by an escaped tiger at the San Francisco Zoo. The toxicology report was included with an autopsy concluding that \u201cblunt force injuries of the head and neck\u201d killed Carlos Sousa Jr., 17. Mr. Sousa\u2019s family has filed a claim against the city as a precursor to a lawsuit. Michael Cardoza, a lawyer for the Sousa family, said it was \u201ctotally irrelevant\u201d whether the teenager had been drinking or smoking marijuana before the mauling.

VAlton Kelley, whose psychedelic concert posters for artists like the Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix and Big Brother and the Holding Company helped define the visual style of the 1960s counterculture, died on Sunday at his home in Petaluma, Calif.

VIN contrast to the writers' rooms of other series, the one for Showtime's ''Weeds'' is almost Spartan. ''We have eliminated most of the distractions from the room,'' said Craig Zisk, an executive producer. All the better, in a strike-shortened season, to focus on the work of reinventing this series, about a widowed suburban mother (Mary-Louise Parker) who sells marijuana. (She has just burned down her neighborhood.) Computers, P.D.A.'s and cellphones had to go. ''We were spending too much time text-messaging each other in the room about what everyone else was saying,'' he said. And at the beginning of the season, after Mr. Zisk and one of the writers lost weight by cutting out sugar, the staff of nine voted to institute a no-sugar policy in the writers' room. The sweets were replaced with fruit plates, dried fruit, nuts and energy drinks. ''We're a very focused group,'' Mr. Zisk said.

VDr. Jeffrey Lieberman is the chairman of the psychiatry department at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and director of the college\u2019s Lieber Center for Schizophrenia Research. He was also a principal investigator in a federal study that compared the effectiveness of an older schizophrenia drug with newer, more expensive drugs. The large, multisite study found that the older drug was generally as effective as the newer ones.

V''See, it looks like the safest street in the city, but it's actually the most dangerous if you happen to be smoking a joint.'' That is how Randy Credico sums up Gay Street, a one-block lane in Greenwich Village connecting Waverly Place and Christopher Street. People out for an evening stroll often use the darkened block as a spot to smoke marijuana, he says, only to find the quiet shattered by sirens.

VEUGENE, Ore. -- It was no wonder Dan O'Brien inserted himself into the debate over how the United States picks its Olympic track and field team, considering he was the world champion in the decathlon who stayed home from the 1992 Games because he flubbed the pole vault at the trials. O'Brien's gaffe was even more noticeable because of the "Dan & Dave" advertising campaign Reebok had already launched featuring O'Brien and his rival Dave Johnson.

V8 P.M. (TCM) BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS (1971) Turner Classic Movies pays tribute to Roddy McDowall -- ''a child actor who was able to continue his career when he grew out of his 'cute' phase,'' as a release puts it, even though he played 14-year-old boys until he was 23. This triple bill begins with ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks,'' the Disney musical starring McDowall as Mr. Jelk, a London vicar, and his friend Angela Lansbury as Eglantine Price, the apprentice witch of Portobello Road. In ''Lassie Come Home'' (1943), a 10-year-old McDowall, above, plays the young master of the stoic collie in her film debut. And in ''Lord Love a Duck'' (1966), at midnight, he portrays a possibly deranged high school student who recalls his infatuation with an exchange student (Tuesday Weld) who, through his Svengali-like influence, goes on to become a star. 7 A.M. (CBS) THE EARLY SHOW Topics include looking younger and understanding colleagues' body language. And the latest castoff from ''Greatest American Dog'' shows the audience some new tricks.

VSoul food appears to be dying in Harlem and elsewhere in the city, Timothy Williams reports in a front-page article. Staples like butter beans, country fried steak, hog maws, oxtails, chicken livers, ham hocks, neck bones and chitterlings have become uncommon, and in some cases, unavailable, in this former soul food capital. The reasons can be chalked up to the vagaries of contemporary city life: changing tastes; health consciousness; the fast-food culture; and an influx of wealthier young adults - including African-Americans, long a customer base for soul food restaurants - who are more comfortable eating Indian or Thai dishes.

VThe N.C.A.A. denied an appeal Monday to restore the eligibility of linebacker Willie Williams at Glenville State College in West Virginia. Williams, 23, a fifth-year senior, was declared ineligible by the N.C.A.A. earlier this month because of transfer rules. Williams will probably transfer to an N.A.I.A. university, where he would be eligible this season.

VThe backup point guard Sam Cassell is back to help the Boston Celtics try to repeat as the N.B.A. champions. Cassell had been in touch with Coach Doc Rivers during the summer, but Rivers did not know if Cassell had decided to come back for another season. Cassell, 38, who joined the team in March for the playoff run, showed up Monday for media day to sign a contract for his 16th N.B.A. season. &#182;Dallas Mavericks forward Josh Howard apologized for a summer&#8217;s worth of troublesome behavior. Howard, the team&#8217;s second-leading scorer behind Dirk Nowitzki, focused mostly on expressing remorse for a YouTube video that showed him disrespecting the national anthem. But he also apologized for his July arrest after police said he was drag racing at 94 miles per hour in a 55 m.p.h. zone and his admission in a radio interview during the playoffs that he smoked marijuana. howard &#182;Miami General Manager Randy Pfund, who helped the Heat win the 2006 N.B.A. championship, resigned after 13 years with the franchise. Pat Riley, the team president, will assume Pfund&#8217;s duties. heat.

VAired Wednesday night on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" on ABC: Miss Teen Louisiana Lindsey Evans has been stripped of her title after being arrested for dining and dashing at a restaurant. Allegedly, Lindsey and three friends ran out of a Louisiana restaurant without paying the bill. Unfortunately for them, Lindsey left her purse behind with her driver's license and marijuana in it. So, police went to her house and arrested her. But did anyone ever consider the possibility that maybe a handbag of marijuana was her way of paying the check?

VLawyers for Michael Mineo, a Brooklyn man who claims that police officers injured him by sodomizing him with an object, have not publicly released his medical records, citing patient privacy as well as a grand jury investigation. But another document surfaced on Tuesday: the summons given to Mr. Mineo after his run-in with the police [pdf, also in viewer below].

VA former Atlanta police officer pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges for his role in a botched drug raid that ended in the shooting death of a 92-year-old woman. The former officer, Arthur Tesler, faces more than 10 years in prison on a charge of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death. The police originally said officers had gone to the home of the woman, Kathryn Johnston, in northwest Atlanta, in 2006 after an informant said he had bought drugs there. But after finding none, officers tried to cover up the mistake by planting bags of marijuana, prosecutors said. In May, Mr. Tesler, 42, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for lying to investigators, but federal prosecutors decided to pursue more charges after reviewing the case.

VAs the economic crisis reshaped the presidential race in early October, Senator John McCain abandoned his campaign in Michigan, a state where he had spent $8 million on advertisements and had made repeated appearances. That decision might have affected Republican candidates farther down the ticket, as Democrats won close House contests against Republican incumbents, giving Democrats an 8-to-7 edge in the state's delegation. Representative Joe Knollenberg, an eight-term Republican, lost to Gary Peters, a Democrat and former state lottery commissioner, in the Detroit suburbs. Jack Kevorkian, the so-called suicide doctor, won more than 9,000 votes.

VIt should come as no surprise that liberal Massachusetts would vote overwhelmingly for Barack Obama, or that the state returned Senator John Kerry, a Democrat, to Washington by a margin of more than two to one in a race against Jeff Beatty, a Republican security specialist whose campaign never seemed to gain traction. This will be Mr. Kerry's fifth term. While there was little suspense in the electoral contests, ballot measures drew strong interest. Voters overwhelmingly approved a proposal to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana, 70 percent to 30 percent.

V10 P.M. (National Geographic) MARIJUANA NATION It's the most widely used illicit drug on the planet and illegal in most countries. In the United States the federal government places marijuana in the same category as heroin. Still, the plant, above -- one of the most complex, with 400 active chemicals and compounds -- is grown with abandon in national forests and parks and in suburban homes converted to greenhouses. In California alone, the marijuana trade outpaces the wine industry, making it one of the largest cash crops in the country. In this ''Explorer'' report, Lisa Ling examines the culture and economics of the plant. 7 A.M. (ABC) GOOD MORNING AMERICABritney Spears celebrates her 27th birthday.

VJets defensive end Shaun Ellis has been charged with possession of marijuana, driving without insurance and speeding. He was pulled over Saturday morning, the day before the Jets' game against the Broncos. (It was also about seven hours after Plaxico Burress shot himself; it's like a bad Playmakers episode). The Jets allowed Ellis, a team captain, to play against the Broncos, and he will play against the 49ers on Sunday. The police said Ellis was uncooperative.

VJets defensive end Shaun Ellis was charged last weekend in New Jersey with marijuana possession, speeding and driving without insurance. Ellis, the team's sack leader, defensive captain and longest-tenured player, will play Sunday at San Francisco, according to a team spokesman. The incident, first reported Thursday by The Daily Record, occurred near Jets headquarters in Florham Park at 8:37 a.m. last Saturday. Ellis was pulled over after he allegedly passed a police car at high speed on Route 287 South while exiting onto Route 24.

Burress did not have a permit.

V8 P.M. (BBC America) MY FAMILY The seventh season of this popular British sitcom begins with the 2006 Christmas episode. Ben (Robert Lindsay, left), the dispirited West London dentist, tries to get out of holiday obligations by pretending to be sick. But his wiseacre wife, Susan (Zoe Wanamaker), insists that he go to the doctor, who decides to run tests. Ben's private hospital room isn't too shabby, but he can't say the same for the crowded ward where he's sent when it's discovered that his health insurance has expired. 1 A.M. (13) DOC Harold L. Humes, right, known as Doc, went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at 16; founded The Paris Review with George Plimpton and Peter Matthiessen; wrote the political novels ''The Underground City'' and ''Men Die''; helped create the New American Cinema Group; championed the use of medical marijuana; designed a paper house that was both fireproof and waterproof; managed Norman Mailer's 1961 run for mayor of New York; and, after becoming mentally ill in the 1960s, reappeared as a hippie philosopher and paranoid, who insisted that the government was keeping tabs on him. Turns out it was. The filmmaker Immy Humes tells the story of her father.

Mr. Hynes was flanked by a number of people from the district attorney's office and the Police Department. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was not present because he had to attend a funeral, Mr. Hynes said.Mr. Hynes said that Officer Richard Kern was charged by a Brooklyn grand jury with aggravated sexual abuse in the first degree, assault in the first degree, and hindering an investigation, among other charges. A conviction on the most serious charge could result up to 25 years in prison. Officers Andrew Morales and Alex Cruz were also charged with hindering the investigation, he said.

VA question-and-answer interview on Tuesday with Mahmoud A. Elsohly, who grows marijuana for research purposes, overstated the role of one government agency in the research. Although the National Institute on Drug Abuse does indeed contract with Dr. ElSohly\u2019s laboratory to grow the cannabis for federally approved researchers, it does not issue permits to the researchers. (As the article noted, the Drug Enforcement Administration does.).

VAmy Winehouse has been summoned by a court in Norway to answer charges of drug possession, and is expected to appear there when the case is tried in January, Agence-France Presse reported. In October 2007 Ms. Winehouse was arrested in Bergen, Norway, with her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, and her hairdresser when they were found with marijuana at a local hotel. Ms. Winehouse paid a fine and was released, but later contested the fine. A previously scheduled court appearance was postponed while Mr. Fielder-Civil was serving time in a British jail on convictions stemming from a 2006 assault. A Norwegian prosecutor told Agence-France Presse, "I was informed by British police on Dec. 23 that she has been legally summoned, and we expect that she will be there when the trial opens on Jan. 12."

VAmy Winehouse has been summoned by a court in Norway to answer charges of drug possession and is expected to appear there when the case is tried in January, Agence-France Presse reported. In October 2007 Ms. Winehouse was arrested in Bergen, Norway, with her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, and her hairdresser when they were found with marijuana at a hotel. Ms. Winehouse paid a fine and was released but later contested the fine. A previous court appearance was postponed while Mr. Fielder-Civil was serving time in a British jail on convictions stemming from a 2006 assault. A Norwegian prosecutor told Agence-France Presse, &#8220;I was informed by British police on Dec. 23 that she has been legally summoned, and we expect that she will be there when the trial opens on Jan. 12.&#8221;.

VAmy Winehouse has dropped her appeal over a drug-possession charge in Norway and will accept a fine in the case, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Winehouse, the British soul singer, was expected to appear in court in Bergen, Norway, next Monday to answer charges of drug possession, after an incident in October 2007 when she, her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, and her hairdresser were found with marijuana at a hotel, according to the police. At that time, the three were held overnight and paid a fine of about $428. Ms. Winehouse later said that the police had made errors in the case and appealed the fine. But on Tuesday, a lawyer for Ms. Winehouse said she had decided to accept the fine. A Norwegian prosecutor confirmed that Ms. Winehouse had withdrawn the appeal and would not appear in court. "That means the fines stand," he said, according to The A.P.

VWell, she warned him that love is a losing game: Blake Fielder-Civil, the husband of Amy Winehouse, is beginning divorce proceedings against her, his lawyer announced on Monday. The lawyer, Henri Brandman, said that Mr. Fielder-Civil would seek a divorce on the grounds of infidelity, The Associated Press reported. The couple were married in May 2007 , and both have had legal problems since then. Mr. Fielder-Civil was arrested in 2007 and later sent to jail for assaulting a man and offering him a bribe. Last week, Ms. Winehouse dropped her appeal of a fine she paid in Norway for possession of what the police said was marijuana. In separate interviews with the British newspaper News of the World, Mr. Fielder-Civil has said he blamed himself for his wife 's drug problems, and Ms. Winehouse, who was hospitalized several times last year, said she was off drugs and in love with a 21-year-old she met on vacation in St. Lucia.

Since this is a New York blog, City Room would appreciate it if you would put a New York spin on it. (For example: How do I cook an owl in Brooklyn?)

VAn appeals court on Thursday overturned the conviction of a former Atlanta police officer sentenced to prison for lying to F.B.I. agents about the killing of a 92-year-old woman in a botched drug raid. In tossing out the conviction of the former officer, Arthur Tesler, on the state charges, the Georgia Court of Appeals said Fulton County prosecutors had failed to prove where the lying took place.

VAn old message comes in a new rapper at the Duke on 42nd Street, where the Green Thumb Theater of Vancouver, British Columbia, is presenting ''Cranked.'' The message is: say no to drugs. The specific drug is crystal meth, the powerfully addictive form of methamphetamine known on the street as speed or crank, and the medium for the message is rap, accompanied by spoken word and hip-hop music in an intermissionless 60-minute show, including a question-and-answer session.

VThe rapper DMX was sentenced on Friday to 90 days in jail and at least 18 months of supervised probation following his conviction on charges of theft, drug possession and animal cruelty, The Associated Press reported. Maricopa County Superior Court Commissioner Phemonia Miller also put DMX, whose real name is Earl Simmons, on supervised probation for at least 18 months. On Dec. 30, Mr. Simmons, 38, pleaded guilty to felony counts of theft, possession or use of marijuana, and possession or use of narcotic drugs, and to a misdemeanor count of animal cruelty. He has been in custody in the Maricopa County Jail since Dec. 9. The time he has already served will not count toward the 90 days, Ms. Miller said on Friday. The animal cruelty and drug charges resulted from a raid of Mr. Simmons' home in August 2007 that was carried out as part of an investigation of a report of animal abuse. A dozen malnourished pit bulls, three dead dogs, guns and drugs were discovered in the raid.

VMichael Phelps does not seem to be in much trouble with his sponsors despite being photographed inhaling from a marijuana pipe. From the apparel company Speedo to the luxury Swiss watchmaker Omega, several sponsors were standing by the 23-year-old Phelps \u2014 at least for now \u2014 and have accepted his public apology. Other companies, like Visa Inc., Subway and Kellogg Co., were not talking.

VThe N.F.L. Players Association is appealing a federal court decision ordering the union to pay $28.1 million to retired players for allegedly cutting them out of lucrative marketing deals. A jury found in November that the union failed to include the retired players in deals with Electronic Arts, the maker of the \u201cMadden NFL\u201d video game, and other companies. Lawyers for the retired players assert that the union excluded them from licensing deals so active players could receive bigger royalty payments. The union argued that companies paid licensing fees exclusively for active players. The players association filed its appeal Tuesday in United States District Court in San Francisco. ¶The former Dallas Cowboys receiver Terry Glenn was arrested on public intoxication and marijuana possession charges after appearing disoriented at a hotel, the police said. The Jan. 25 arrest came after the police received a call of a person who was wandering the hallways checking door handles, said Irving, Tex., Officer David Tull. glenn.

VDrugs | What's "incredible" about the Michael Phelps marijuana case is that a sheriff is actually looking to prosecute him and "apply the law equally," a columnist says.

VThey got it backward with Michael Phelps. They suspended him from competition for three months, which means he now has more time to wander into parties and hold interesting-looking objects up to his face and say, ''Hey, dude, what's this?'' What USA Swimming, the national federation, should have done was make him perform community service by competing in swim meets every day of the week and give him obligatory practices, since this is a lad who obviously functions better in chlorinated water than on terra firma.

VMonday, 5 p.m. Conceivably, the only thing more dismal than one of the city's ubiquitous Wall Street Pink Slip parties (laid-off bankers, wolfish recruiters, $8 beers) is a get-to-know-you bash for the geniuses who just got their real estate licenses at this -- perhaps the worst moment for selling property in more than 20 years.

VA group of Latin American leaders have called on President Obama to rethink America's campaign against illegal drugs, which they blame for helping to foment crime, corruption and political instability in Latin America while failing to reduce the availability of drugs in America. The criticism appears in a report from the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy.

VCalling Mexican drug trafficking organizations ''a national security threat,'' Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced Wednesday that federal authorities had mounted their biggest assault against one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels. More than 750 people nationwide have been arrested, tons of cocaine and marijuana have been seized and the distribution of drugs has been disrupted through a series of raids and arrests as part of an investigation begun under the Bush administration 21 months ago, Mr. Holder said.

VHOLMES WAIVES HEARING Pittsburgh receiver Santonio Holmes waived his right to a preliminary hearing on a misdemeanor marijuana charge stemming from an October traffic stop. No trial date had been set. (AP) COLTS AND SATURDAY AGREE Indianapolis center Jeff Saturday agreed to a three-year deal hours before he was expected to become a free agent. Saturday's agent, Ralph Cindrich, confirmed the deal to The Associated Press. He did not disclose financial details but said the deal would make Saturday one of the N.F.L.'s highest-paid centers. (AP) COWBOYS RELEASE JOHNSON Dallas released the backup quarterback Brad Johnson. Johnson, a 17-year veteran quarterback, was ineffective during a three-game stint as the starter last season when Tony Romo broke his right pinkie. (AP)

VLandmarks and Toilets Tuesday 9 a.m. If you're the sort of person who mourns the loss of grit in New York City, then the third item on today's agenda of the Landmarks Preservation Commission will come as a relief. The fact is, few care if a wealthy lawyer builds a porch on his colonial revival, but the installation of a public toilet at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn is important beyond dispute. The application to build the public privy will weigh the merits of convenience against the aesthetic damage it might cause to the plaza and Prospect Park. The actual decision is more or less beside the point. Our public servants are talking about the simple things again. 1 Centre Street, Ninth floor, Manhattan.

VTHE NEWS The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board voted to make commuting in the New York area much more costly: subway, bus and commuter rail fares and bridge and tunnel tolls would rise at least 20 percent to 30 percent, with broad cuts in service. BEHIND THE NEWS The board said a looming $1.2 billion budget deficit left it no choice. But the real aim of the proposals was to rattle state political leaders enough to break an impasse over a rescue for the M.T.A. The governor and Assembly leaders have a plan for a much smaller fare increase and no service cuts, but it would add tolls on East River bridges that are now free, an idea facing resistance in the State Senate.

VMILLBURN -- A Millburn youth and an 18-year-old Short Hills man were arrested for marijuana possession during a week that ended with school officials announcing that police with drug-sniffing dogs will begin random searches of Millburn High School. The arrests are among the crimes reported this week in the weekly Millburn police blotter, a round-up of crimes investigated by the Millburn Police Department. The blotter is released to the public by Capt. James Miller, patrol commander/public information officer, and is edited and condensed by The Local.

They've had to recall more than one million cars due to safety reasons. The one million cars were very easy to locate. No one had bought them. They're still in the showrooms.

VAs the number of charter schools in New York City and elsewhere swells, unions have become increasingly aggressive in trying to organize their teachers. These two major forces in education politics, having long faced off in ideological opposition, have begun in some places to enter tentative and cautious partnerships, and in others to engage in fierce combat. New York City's teachers' union now runs two charter schools in Brooklyn, and workers have organized at many more, including more than a dozen across New York State.

That leaves her husband (Michael Shanks) to care for the children (Jessica Amlee and Alex Ferris) he'd been too busy to get to know. But when Emily befriends some strong-willed women, including Connie (Babz Chula), while undergoing treatment, she learns to set some goals of her own. 7 A.M. (NBC) TODAY Reports on the horses and the jockeys of the Kentucky Derby.

Somehow John Edwards convinced his wife it was the mistress' fault and she seduced him. Guys, let me tell you something. Don't try this with your wife, O.K.? John Edwards is a politician and a trial lawyer. That means he is a professional liar. He knows how to do this. You cannot get away with this. It will not work for you.

VMy liver failed two springs ago, when I was a senior in high school. I don't know the cause of my liver disease -- a genetic mutation, an environmental trigger or just plain bad luck. But one of the many rules of my long recovery has been no alcohol. Not one drink. Not even a sip.

VTHE NEWS The Obama administration sought broad authority from Congress to oversee the often-complex but largely unregulated financial instruments known as derivatives. BEHIND THE NEWS One kind in particular, credit-default swaps, played a major role in the financial crisis, especially at the giant insurer American International Group, which was spared from collapse last fall by a $170 billion government bailout. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, above, wants to require that swaps and other derivatives be traded publicly on regulated exchanges and, like bank loans, be backed by capital reserves.

VMonologue | Aired Friday night on NBC: Our Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to legalize marijuana. He says the taxes on it will help raise money to balance the budget. Now, see, this can go one of two ways. Either California will raise some revenue and balance the budget or California still goes broke but everybody's too stoned to care. So, you see, it's a win-win, really.

VEver since Obama's victory, Republicans have been all about improving their new media skillz -- embracing the Twitter, the Facebook and any other Web 2.0 outpost in site. The latest video from the Republican National Committee demonstrates a full working knowledge of another staple of the new media age, the mashup. It's a Gitmo attack on Obama, via L.B.J.'s infamous 1964 "Daisy ad."

VThere seems no part of public, private or commercial life that hasn't been made more accessible through social networking tools like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Hospitals are posting videos of surgeries on YouTube and doctors are sending tweets from operating rooms to educate the public and market their services. Those are just the latest examples of media-driven communication in places that used to be relatively private.

The realization that the commotion at 92nd Street and Third Avenue was not caused by a television shoot left nearby residents stunned, curious and ultimately frightened.

V9 P.M. (TNT) THE CLOSER Change is afoot in the life of Deputy Police Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick, above) as Season 5 begins, though her doughnut habit is still raging full force. But first an investigation into the murder of a family of four will lead her into conflict with the F.B.I. The ensemble cast, which was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award this year, includes Jon Tenney, J. K. Simmons, Corey Reynolds, Robert Gossett, G. W. Bailey, Tony Denison, Raymond Cruz, Michael Paul Chan and Phillip P. Keene. 10 A.M. (Fox Business Network) THREE DAYS IN THE VALLEY Liz Claman travels to Silicon Valley to investigate the state of the technology business through interviews with chief executives, starting with Carol A. Bartz of Yahoo, John Riccitiello of Electronic Arts, John Donahoe of eBay and Paul S. Otellini of Intel.

VMANCHESTER, Tenn. -- Erykah Badu came onstage about as incognito as a headliner could, wearing a hoodie (Public Enemy logo) with shades over artfully ripped and paint-spattered blue jeans. At one point, she even had a hat on top of the hoodie. But even before she showed her face, her songs were tell-alls: about her age, her babies, her gap between albums, her body, her first romance, with each revelation drawing approving oohs from women in the audience. Her band played serenely undulating vamps as Ms. Badu sang, rhymed and scat-sang what might have been a stream-of-consciousness autobiography. But it wasn't; her backup singers, both rehearsed and attentive, underlined selected phrases with neat harmonies, proof that Ms. Badu had her story all planned out.Merle Haggard's anti-hippie broadside from 1969, "Okie from Muskogee," is his signature song; his band plays it for his entrance and exit onstage. By now, he's played it in all sorts of places. But there was still a little piquancy to see him sing "We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee/We don't take our trips on LSD" to a tie-dyed crowd with, shall we say, a different lifestyle. And while it was drinking songs and Johnny Cash hits that got the crowd whooping loudest, Mr. Haggard also set out his down-to-earth populism, starting his set with a trenchant song about debt: "A Working Man Can't Get Nowhere Today."

V9 P.M. (History) THE CRUMBLING OF AMERICA The Romans had their roads and aqueducts; the Mayans, their pyramids and palaces. But what happens when a great civilization neglects its infrastructure? This two-hour report investigates the deterioration of highways, tunnels, dams, levees, ports and pipelines in the United States, including more than 70,000 bridges rated as structurally deficient and 25,000 miles of commercial waterways and locks that have exceeded their 50-year design life. One warning: the 2007 collapse of the Interstate 35W Bridge, above, in Minneapolis. One segment looks at structures on a ''worst of'' list. Another introduces technologies and detection techniques to prevent catastrophes. 7 A.M. (CBS) THE EARLY SHOW Reba Toney talks about her book, ''The Rating Game: The Foolproof Formula for Finding Your Perfect Soul Mate''; also, the recession's effect on pets.

VLEVON HELM ''Electric Dirt'' (Dirt Farmer Music/Vanguard) Despite the title, don't expect an onslaught of power chords on ''Electric Dirt,'' which is just as likely to deploy a mandolin or a honky-tonk piano. It's the second album made by Levon Helm, who played drums and sang with the Band, since he recovered from throat cancer and started a series of roots-rocking ''Midnight Ramble'' concerts at his barn in Woodstock, N.Y., then took them on the road.

VMaybe consumers - especially the ones reading this blog - aren't so irrational after all. In my Findings column, I describe how the patrons of a restaurant in Israel turned out to be surprisingly immune to the experimental manipulations of behavioral economists. And now there's more evidence of sensible shopping behavior from an informal (and unscientific) survey of Lab readers. It was conducted in connection with an earlier column about Geoffrey Miller's new book, "Spent: Sex, Evolution and Consumer Behavior." Dr. Miller issued an open invitation to readers to try this exercise:

VMonologue | Aired Thursday night on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" on ABC: Here in California, we have no money. Our budget situation is a mess. And when you have no money, what do you do? You sell drugs, right? A state representative from San Francisco just introduced a bill that would legalize marijuana. He claims it would raise almost $1.5 billion a year for the state in taxes, and another $3 billion in Cheeto sales.

V9 P.M. (TLC) WHAT NOT TO WEAR The series gets a mini-makeover of its own with the arrival of Ted Gibson, a hairstylist to the likes of Anne Hathaway and Angelina Jolie and at runway shows for Prada and Chanel. With a fondness for luxurious coifs, he replaces the scissor-happy Nick Arrojo, whose snips have caused some recipients to weep, not always for joy. Above, Mr. Gibson with his first client: the flowing-tressed Ariel Stewart, a 26-year-old ''kissing wench'' at the Georgia Renaissance Festival whose wardrobe is stuck in the Dark Ages. Will Mr. Gibson's hair redo cause Ms. Stewart, a k a Ruby Two-lypps, to pucker up -- or pout? 7 A.M.

VLeBron James struggled with sudden fame after appearing on Sports Illustrated's cover as a 17-year-old and admitted he smoked marijuana during his junior year in high school. Those are two of the revelations in a book chronicling James's rise from an Akron, Ohio, basketball prodigy to an N.B.A. superstar. In ''Shooting Stars,'' written by James and the co-author Buzz Bissinger and scheduled to be released in September, James said the magazine cover and the news media attention he and his high school teammates received was difficult to handle.

VBecoming a parent changed the way I read the newspaper. (It changed the way I write for it, too, in many of the same ways.) After my son was born, a barrier fell, and I found it harder to separate myself from the parents in the headlines when something awful happened to a child. I tried, as we all do, to make fine distinctions about why that couldn't happen to MY child. But I usually knew that my mental gymnastics were exactly that. Most of these things could happen to anyone.

Some of these queries were inspired by Rhode Island, which has both the highest drug prevalence rate and one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.

The proposal comes in the aftermath of the deadly crash on the Taconic State Parkway, in which Diane Schuler killed herself and seven others while drunk and under the influence of marijuana.

VRetrospective winks at past ignorance are what makes ''Mad Men'' so funny and, at times, so chilling. ''Mad Men'' mocks and celebrates forbidden vices, the drinking, smoking and promiscuity that in the advertising business of the 1960s flowed heedlessly, without health warnings or the sour taint of political incorrectness. From the start, the show has mined hindsight for wicked humor: a child playing dangerously with a dry-cleaning bag is chided only for messing up the clothes inside; a pastoral family picnic ends with the mom tossing the entire basket of trash onto lush, pristine park grounds; the presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon is marketed as a young, handsome Navy hero.

VA home video obtained by NBC News of the collision Saturday between a plane and a helicopter over the Hudson River seems to show that the plane tried to veer right to avoid the helicopter. The footage, shot by an Italian tourist on the Circle Line who was recording his friends' helicopter trip, may aid the National Transportation Safety Board investigation.

VRex Ryan has injected a badly needed dose of energy and humor into the Jets, but his players are not giving him much help getting his defense off the ground. On Monday, the N.F.L. announced that defensive end Shaun Ellis would be suspended for the season opener and fined $100,000 because of his arrest last November for marijuana possession, speeding and driving without insurance. For a team that hopes to play Ravens-style football -- low-scoring games with a great defense and a tough running game limiting the need for a rookie quarterback to win the game with his arm (assuming Mark Sanchez gets the starting job) -- the suspension was not good news. Especially because linebacker Calvin Pace will miss the first four games for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.

VWHITNEY HOUSTON ''I Look to You'' (Arista) Without adversity, a diva is just a singer. It's the back story, the tale of struggle and tenacity, that draws audiences to read more than musicianship into her performances. The singer touches on something personal so the listener can feel like a witness, a confidant, a judge, a voyeur, or perhaps all at once. Seven years after her last album of pop songs, two years after her divorce, Whitney Houston re-emerges with full diva qualifications on ''I Look to You,'' released Monday. Most of its revelations aren't verbal; they're in the husky, vehement sound of her voice.

VMillburn police were called to the Armani Exchange at The Mall at Short Hills on Saturday, after two men tried to steal 38 shirts worth a total of $1,934. The police were then told of a man, identified as Julio C. Gonzalez, 20, of North Bergen, who had fallen 20 feet off the Bloomingdale's upper parking deck. The police said he was identified as the shoplifter, taken to Morristown Memorial Hospital, and charged with possession of an anti-shoplifting device and with shoplifting. In another crime incident, the police pulled over a car with bad front-end damage on Thursday night, and determined that the driver, a 17-year-old resident, had not been involved as suspected in an earlier incident. However, the police said, they found he had marijuana and drug paraphernalia. He was arrested on drug charges and for violations of learner's permit rules. -- Tina Kelley

VTHERE is a certain car in my neighborhood, a sporty silver Mazda with Thule bike racks. I would have no interest in it if not for its owner's insistence on taking up two spaces every time he parks. Day after day, it's the same thing. He nudges his car into a parallel space, nestling it about four feet from the bumper in front of him, as if this is going to protect his precious vehicle from errant dings, or make quick escapes easier. The effect for the rest of us is one less space that could have gone to a parent juggling children and groceries.

VMexico last month adopted a law that decriminalizes the possession of small amounts of marijuana and harder drugs, including cocaine and heroin. Other countries in Latin America are considering similar changes in their laws, prompting antidrug groups in the U.S. to say that pressure from south of the border will push the United States toward decriminalization, if not legalization, of drugs.

VThe Maplewood police, helped by the county K-9 unit and armed with a search warrant, arrested Juvens Exantus, 20, and his brother Daniel Exantus, 18, at their Franklin Avenue home at about 5 p.m. Friday, and charged them with possessing drug paraphernalia and under 50 grams of marijuana. Four other Maplewood residents were questioned at the scene, and on Monday police searched a car seized during the raid. More charges may be forthcoming, the police said. Neighbors had discussed suspicious activity at the house on this thread on Maplewood Online. --Tina Kelley

VThe hit men moved in on their target, shot him dead and then disappeared in a matter of seconds. It would have been a perfect case for José Ibarra Limón, one of this violent border city's most dogged crime investigators -- had he not been the victim. Mexico has never been particularly adept at bringing criminals to justice, and the drug war has made things worse. Investigators are now swamped with homicides and other drug crimes, most of which they will never crack. On top of the standard obstacles -- too little expertise, too much corruption -- is one that seems to grow by the day: outright fear of becoming the next body in the street.

Perhaps, because it is no longer an empire, the country has turned in on itself, to explore possibilities within its borders, as if to say, \u201cWhy leave when there is so much interesting stuff going on here?\u201d While this island mentality may have encouraged colorful characters like Edith Sitwell and Lord Byron, it also gave the world genuine nutters like the 20th-century composer, writer and painter Gerald Tyrwhitt-Wilson, the 14th Baron Berners, who built his towering Faringdon Folly on his estate to be \u201centirely useless.\u201d Herewith, some other peculiar folks from across the pond.

VMonologue | Aired Tuesday night on NBC: Federal agents will no longer go after patients taking medical marijuana or their suppliers under the new guidelines by the Obama Administration. President Obama is very smart. He figures if he couldn't appease the left by withdrawing from Iraq or closing Gitmo or appealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," they'll all be too stoned to care.

VDENVER -- Like other states, Colorado is trying to figure out how to deal with the United States Department of Justice's announcement last week that users and providers of medical marijuana will not be prosecuted when they are in compliance with state law. Here in Colorado, local officials say that a big concern is a surge in new users of the drug, which Colorado's top health official, James B. Martin, called "an abuse of the system."

VIt may be an off year for elections, but there are still a lot of races on Tuesday. The big contests are the governors' elections in New Jersey and Virginia, but there will be voting for mayors in several big cities, some states have referendums or ballot initiatives and there are a couple of vacant Congressional seats to be filled. In New Jersey, the race between Gov. Jon S. Corzine and Christopher J. Christie, his Republican challenger, appears to be very tight, according to the latest polls. When an independent candidate, Christopher J. Daggett, is included, he receives 8 percent to 20 percent of the support of likely voters. All differences between Mr. Corzine and Mr. Christie fall within each poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus three or four percentage points on each candidate.

But at Med Grow Cannabis College, marijuana is the curriculum: the history, the horticulture and the legal how-to's of Michigan's new medical marijuana program. ''This state needs jobs, and we think medical marijuana can stimulate the state economy with hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars,'' said Nick Tennant, the 24-year-old founder of the college, which is actually a burgeoning business (no baccalaureates here) operating from a few bare-bones rooms in a Detroit suburb.

VJonathan Babineaux, a fifth-year defensive tackle and perhaps the Falcons' best pass rusher this season, has been charged with possessing 1.5 ounces of marijuana. He was arrested during a traffic stop Thursday night. Babineaux practiced Friday but refused interview requests after the one-hour workout. Coach Mike Smith declined to say whether Babineaux would play Sunday when the Falcons (6-6) host New Orleans (12-0). According to the Gwinnett County police spokesman Cpl. David Schiralli, Babineaux and another man, Aaron Robinson, were driving in Babineaux's 2005 Cadillac Escalade when the police pulled them over. ''It was pretty routine,'' Schiralli said. ''The officer saw that the vehicle had an expired tag, no tag light and too heavy a tint on the windows. The officer smelled marijuana and found three bags containing a total of approximately 40 grams.''

VWhile at the mall last week, I met a friend laden with department-store packages. She was not looking the least bit merry. She had checked nearly a dozen people off her list, she said, but they were all the teachers and tutors and coaches of her three children, and she was not at all sure the gifts she had purchased for them were the right kinds.

VWhy a Toronto man stole 2,865 bicycles last year remained a mystery on Tuesday after he pleaded guilty to reduced charges. Under the terms of a plea bargain, the man, Igor Kenk was convicted of possessing just 10 stolen bicycles, as well as cocaine and marijuana. After the 17 months he spent in jail awaiting trial, he will have to serve an additional four months. Similar charges against his common-law wife, Jeanie Chung, a concert pianist, were dropped. The police said Mr. Kenk, who owns a used bike shop, either stole the bicycles or arranged for their theft, and stashed them in garages around the city. While various theories have been floated about his plans for the bikes, he declined an invitation by the judge to make a statement.

VFOR nearly a year starting in July 2004, Philip Carlo traveled some 50 times to the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton and sat knee to knee with Richard Kuklinski, interviewing him about the more than 200 victims he claimed to have shot, knifed, bludgeoned, poisoned or fed to giant rats. Mr. Carlo, perhaps the dean of true-crime horror writers and the sometime muse of Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro, was drawn to Mr. Kuklinski, a coldly detached Mafia killer known as the Iceman, for a book now heading to the big screen starring Mr. Rourke.

It hung in the hallways and meeting rooms of the company's vast, collegiate-looking offices in this suburban hamlet about 40 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.

V1. MAXWELL ''BLACKsummers'night'' (Columbia) Maxwell's fourth album, defies current R&B on all fronts. It's gentle and imploring, not cocky. It's elliptical, not blatant. It's hand played, by a band complete with a horn section, rather than programmed. It's so improvisatory that melodies change from verse to verse. And even when the rhythm gets funky, the sad, lovely songs -- about a crumbling romance -- are suffused with a yearning that's almost too intimate. It's soul music reinventing itself, moment to moment. 2. ANIMAL COLLECTIVE ''Merriweather Post Pavilion'' (Domino) Synthesized jubilation runs through this dizzying album. Echoes are everywhere: loops pile on loops in iridescent patterns; percussion crackles and rattles; and vocals cascade across it all. The lyrics, when deciphered, are often domestic thoughts of love, home and worrying about the children, but there's also a radiant innocence. No other band could make ''I want to walk around with you'' sound like such bliss.

VUpdated, 12:42 p.m. | Occasionally our stories strike a nerve, or at least make readers want to have their say. City Room has a cadre of regulars who make comments, but there were plenty of first-timers in 2009 who weighed in on subjects like the same-sex marriage bill, the splashdown of US Airways Flight 1549 and the Air Force One backup that, for a photo op, flew a little too close to Lower Manhattan. For the 3314 items we published, City Room received 82535 comments last year, 82256 of which were approved.

VSomewhere Over the Rainbow, Zeppelin Profits Wait | The 246-foot zeppelin "Eureka," which has been flying out of Mountain View's Moffett Field for 14 months now, already could contend for many prizes: First dirigible to fly over the United States in more than 70 years, largest craft of its type in the country (almost 60 foot longer than the Goodyear blimp), and so forth. But it is also in contention for a more dubious award: worst timing for the launch of a high-end tourist-and-advertising venture. In 2007, the Bay Area seemed ideal for all three of the company's planned revenue streams, from fees for scientific research to its $495-per-head tickets. Now the question is whether it can float above the roiling economy long enough to come to a safe and profitable landing.

VPersonal Lives on the Stand | In the first day of the same-sex marriage trial in federal court in San Francisco, Theodore B. Olson asked his client, "What does it mean to be a lesbian?" Two gay couples testified about their lives and their reactions to the 2008 passage of Proposition 8, the state ballot initiative that changed the state's constitution so that gays and lesbians could not marry. Video coverage of the nonjury trial, which addresses the constitutionality of the gay-marriage ban, is not available on YouTube, as had been planned. Hours before the trial began, the United States Supreme halted, for a few days, the plan to show the court proceedings on YouTube until the justices could review the issue of cameras in the court room.

VWhen it comes to gore, Mexico's drug traffickers seem to compete among themselves for the title of most depraved. One will chop off the heads of victims. Another will string dead rivals from bridges or burn their genitals. Recently, hit men removed the face from a dead man and sewed it onto a soccer ball. On Tuesday, Mexican authorities announced the capture of one of those who they said had been active in this game of one-upmanship, Teodoro Eduardo García Simental, described as a ruthless drug lord based just south of the American border in Tijuana. Mr. García's trademark, when not trafficking marijuana and methamphetamine to the United States, was boiling the remains of his rivals in barrels of lye in what has become known as pozole, for the Mexican stew, the authorities said.

("I'm going to tell him I'm talking to the new him," he said.) Not sucking up, but the new him thinks that Mr. Harrelson has a shot at some awards glory at the Golden Globes this weekend for his against-type performance in "The Messenger" as Capt. Tony Scott, a hard-driving, hard-living Army man charged with delivering news of fallen soldiers to their families. Mr. Harrelson, of course, is a famous peacenik, a hippie by his own admission, known equally for being pro-marijuana and antiwar.

The police said the teenagers scanned the Internet on school computers, took "several items" from two classrooms (including two Palm Pilot PDAs, which were recovered) and munched on some food they found in a classroom.

VMedical marijuana's support among voters in New York State is so solid that even a substantial majority of Republicans favor its legalization, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday. The poll found that 71 percent of voters supported medical marijuana, including 55 percent of registered Republicans. The poll numbers seem to confirm others cited by sponsors of the current medical marijuana bill in the Assembly. The poll, on a range of issues before the State Legislature, also found that 75 percent of New York voters support a wage freeze for state workers to help balance the budget, while 78 percent oppose cutting state aid to schools to do so. Gov. David A. Paterson's proposed tax on sugary sodas, meanwhile, was opposed by 57 percent of voters.

VSan Francisco to Rethink School Assignment System | The San Francisco School Board will consider proposals at its meeting on Tuesday night to replace its complex and controversial school assignment system with a new system that could take into account a family's proximity to a school. In place since 2002, the current system uses a "diversity index," which looks at factors like family income, but not race, in an effort to ensure a racial mix. Parents have complained that the system is complex and often assigns their children to undesirable schools far from home. [The San Francisco Chronicle]
