VWhen President Clinton named Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey to "lead our nation's battle against drugs at home and abroad," he said General McCaffrey would need, to succeed, "a force far larger than he has ever commanded before. He needs all of us." What General McCaffrey really needs is a quality that has been lacking in White House drug czars and other leaders of American drug policy for decades. That is an open mind: the ability to look at the policy of drug prohibition and appraise, realistically, what good and what harm it is doing to our society.

VJennifer Capriati, the troubled tennis player who beat Steffi Graf to win the Olympic gold medal in 1992, is scheduled to make her first tournament appearance since November 1994 in the Paris Open next week. "She feels ready to play," said Barbara Perry, Capriati's agent. Perry said Capriati had asked for, and was granted, a wild-card entry into the main draw of the tournament. Capriati will leave for Paris from her home base in Florida on Thursday. The tournament begins next Tuesday.

But in 1996, American law enforcement is watching you, and listening, using advanced technology to record what goes on in entire city blocks. Since late December, the police in this bayside suburb of San Francisco have hidden sophisticated listening devices throughout a section of the city that has been plagued by gang shootings and random gunfire.

VWashington Square Park once offered, in Henry James's words, "a kind of established repose which is not of frequent occurrence in other quarters of the long, shrill city." In recent decades, Villagers and tourists seeking the park's repose have been just as likely to be greeted with a steady chorus of "smoke, smoke" and "sense, sense," from drug dealers hawking marijuana and sensimilla, a potent strain of the drug. Lately, though, the heat has been on, and not just the drug dealers are unhappy. Some residents are concerned that as the police arrest more dealers and users within the park, drug activity will filter over to the streets and sidewalks near their homes.

VA startling rise in the use of methamphetamine in California and the Southwest has raised fears among law-enforcement officials that the trend toward dangerous stimulants could spread across the country much as crack did in the 1980's. To stanch the tide of what is described as an extremely dangerous drug, the Drug Enforcement Administration today convened its first conference of Federal, state and local law-enforcement officials to formulate a national strategy to combat the trafficking and abuse of methamphetamines, which induce manifestations of irrational aggression and paranoia.

VJohn Scanlon, the longtime public relations executive, has temporarily left the board of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, citing a potential conflict with a new client, the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation. Steve Dnistrian, a senior vice president at the Partnership in New York, confirmed a report of Mr. Scanlon's decision this week in The Daily News in New York. Mr. Dnistrian said the potential conflict that concerned Mr. Scanlon was if the partnership were ever to expand the purview of its attacks to include legal products like cigarettes and alcoholic beverages in addition to illegal drugs like cocaine and marijuana.

VCypress Hill, the top-selling Los Angeles rap band that has made a career of marijuana advocacy, was a jumble of contradictions when it performed on Thursday night at the Palladium. In "Insane in the Brain," it roused its audience with chants of "Is everybody insane right now?" After concertgoers affirmed that their brains were indeed mush, the band dedicated its next song to the "strong-minded" and proclaimed that there better be no weak-minded people in the crowd. Later in the show, the band announced a truce between the warring centers of hip-hop, the East Coast and the West Coast, and brought out the Staten Island rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard and the Bronx rapper King Sun as a gesture of peace and unity. The expanded group then collaborated on a song of hate, "No Rest for the Wicked," a breathless stream of put-downs and threats directed at the West Coast rapper Ice Cube.

VArmed with a flood of intelligence showing that Mexico has become a huge conduit for cocaine, methamphetamines, marijuana and heroin sold in the United States, Federal narcotics officials are urging the Clinton Administration to drop Mexico from a list of countries making progress against drug trafficking. If the Administration takes such a drastic step against Mexico -- and the odds are still against it though a final decision has not been made -- it would almost certainly be accompanied by a waiver that would allow Mexico to continue receiving aid.

VA mini-revolution has swept through Italy's book publishing industry in recent years, and it has even produced a small miracle: paperback sales are up and prices of all kinds of books are down, thanks to an explosion of little books costing, in many cases, less than a daily newspaper. Some say it began with Epicurus, the third-century B.C. Greek, a collection of whose aphorisms swept Italy in 1992, selling a million copies at a time when paperbacks on average sold 20,000 copies. Known generically as mille lire books because most of them cost 1,000 lire (roughly 65 cents), the new arrivals -- some slim, some squat, but all small and cheap -- have made such a big noise on the Italian market that they now account for 25 percent of total paperback sales and are credited with an almost 30 percent drop in prices on all books, including textbooks, children's books and hardbacks.

VOn a weekday afternoon recently, the streets of this city's largely black Hillbrow neighborhood were alive with commerce -- vendors selling fruit from plates on the sidewalk, barbers working under makeshift tents, men sitting behind ancient pedal-powered sewing machines, willing to tailor at a moment's notice. But everywhere, it seemed, there were also anxious young whites. A group of white teen-age girls, still in school uniforms, approached a doorway looking over their shoulders. Across the street, two white boys waited outside a gate nervously jiggling their pockets. At a service station, a young white woman darted from her car to speak to a man on the corner. The exchanges -- money for drugs -- were quick and not particularly subtle.

VThey were studying to become nurses aides, carpenters and bricklayers and trying to overcome what they saw as bad decisions that were holding them back. Some had dropped out of school. Some could not find jobs. Some came from troubled families. Some were drug users. But all eight of the Job Corps trainees who died on Friday night in Silver Spring, Md., when the commuter train they were on crashed into an Amtrak locomotive had expectations of a brighter future.

The survey, commissioned by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, tracked attitudes toward drugs last year among 8,520 children and 822 parents across the United States.

VA NEW, superactive strain of mice that dash about their cages as if they are high on cocaine is yielding fresh ideas about ways to treat devastating human disorders, including drug addiction, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. The mice, which are at least five times as active as normal ones, are described in the current issue of the journal Nature by a team from the University of North Carolina and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Duke University.

VDoctors at Kings County Hospital Center never checked on the outpatient treatment of a mentally ill teen-ager accused in the death of a woman in a subway robbery on Sunday, even though state officials say regulations require psychiatric hospitals to monitor such patients to make sure they get the help they need after discharge. Officials, including the head of the city's public hospital system, agreed yesterday that 15-year-old Jaheem Grayton -- who had a history of mental problems and violence and spent a month at Kings County last year -- did not receive adequate care after he left the hospital in December. But they disagreed sharply on who was to blame.

VDiscovery of an important biochemical difference in the brains of smokers suggests a new way, independent of nicotine, in which smoking may become addictive. The discovery concerns an enzyme that breaks down dopamine, a pleasure-enhancing chemical in the brain. Using a technique for imaging the living brain, reseachers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, L.I., have found that the enzyme is 40 percent less active in smokers, suggesting that dopamine levels would presumably be somewhat higher.

VThe first stage of Jennifer Capriati's second comeback ended today in the quarterfinals of the Faber Grand Prix in three very competitive sets against Jana Novotna. To hear Capriati tell it, there will definitely be more tennis to come. The question is when. If the left hip flexor she strained early in today's 7-6 (8-6), 2-6, 6-3 defeat heals as quickly as expected, she will consider accepting a wild card for the State Farm Evert Cup at Indian Wells, Calif., on March 4. If not, she will probably return to action in the United States two weeks later at the Lipton Championships in Key Biscayne, Fla.

VNestled since 1909 in the sheltering hills of western Massachusetts, the Berkshire School has earned a reputation as one of the more nurturing private secondary schools in New England. Then last month, a substance thought to be the illegal hallucinogen colloquially known as LSD shattered the school's tranquility, compelling students and faculty members alike to weigh the larger costs of drug abuse. A pair of Berkshire students were rumored to have smuggled in as many as 200 doses and sold them for $5 to $7 a "hit" to other students, infusing a Saturday night with disorientation and panic.

VOne of every five dollars New Yorkers pay in city taxes is spent coping with the effects of smoking, drinking and drug use, according to a study released yesterday by the Center for Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. The study calculated that substance abuse cost New York City $20 billion in 1994, the year analyzed. Much of that expense was borne by the Federal and state governments through programs like Medicaid, and by private business, through higher security costs and lost productivity. The city's share amounted to $3.8 billion of the $18 billion it collected in taxes, or 21 cents of every city tax dollar.

VDr. Fred Ruder was a dentist in Panama City, Fla. He agreed to put some money in a business of his dental assistant's husband -- who turned out to be running marijuana. Dr. Ruder was prosecuted for conspiracy to distribute marijuana. Though he had never sold any himself, or profited, he was convicted and sentenced to the mandatory minimum of five years in a Federal prison without parole. The Government also seized his home and cars. His wife, a nurse, now supports herself and their two children.

VPresident Clinton declared today that Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producer, had failed to cooperate in the fight against illegal drugs, a determination that not only stigmatizes it but also makes the country ineligible for most American economic aid. In the same finding, Mr. Clinton certified that Mexico, an important free-trade partner, was cooperating with international efforts to stop such narcotics trafficking, even though it has become a major conduit for illegal drugs smuggled into the United States.

VOn Feb. 11, The City profiled the scene at a Jamaica, Queens, pawnshop run by a man known as Goldfinger, who helps out aspiring rappers. Here's a look at one of his proteges, Borngod Allah, who has just had a child. "Dreams are for suckers," Borngod Allah said through a cloud of cigarette smoke, his feet propped up and crossed on the desk in Goldfinger's pawnshop. "Look around, life's full of toy soldiers." He jumped up to emphasize the point, spanking both palms. "People's immobilized, locked up, and they can't go nowhere but they thinking they can." He caught his reflection in the window and stopped to check his look.

VIT is fairly common knowledge that many high school and even junior high school students experiment with drugs, but what about youngsters still in elementary grades? To stop them from becoming involved with marijuana and alcohol, the yearly all-elementary schools meeting of the Mamaroneck Public Schools will, for the first time, focus on drugs. Open to the public, the meeting is expected to draw several hundred parents to the Hommocks School in the town of Mamaroneck on March 4 at 7:30 P.M. There will be a panel discussion with Anne Deware, coordinator of the drug and alcohol awareness program at Mamaroneck High School; Kathy Pressler of Student Assistance Services, a nonprofit organization based in Armonk that deals with personal issues; Maureen Cahil, director in Mamaroneck of a Federal drug-free school grant, and Tom Carney, a youth outreach worker from Scarsdale Middle School.

VThe Supreme Court ruled today that manufacturers of Agent Orange, the chemical defoliant that American troops sprayed over Vietnam, cannot sue the Federal Government to recover their costs of defending and settling lawsuits by veterans who trace various health problems to their exposure to dioxin, one of the defoliant's byproducts. Although the military prescribed the formula and specifications for millions of gallons of Agent Orange, in some cases requiring contractors to turn over their plants to its production, the contracts between the Government and the manufacturers cannot be interpreted as waiving the Government's sovereign immunity from suits to which it has not consented, the Court said.

VIntensifying Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's crackdown on so-called quality-of-life crimes, the Police Department has quietly begun increasing the number of arrests it makes for marijuana smoking, fare-beating and other misdemeanors, senior police officials said yesterday. From now on, people who fail to produce proper identification after being found committing such crimes, or people found committing them in areas like Times Square and Washington Square Park, will be arrested. In the past, they were mostly given summonses and released.

VRecalling the experiences of his own generation, and indeed his own brother, President Clinton warned a rapt audience of high school students today that illegal drugs were dangerous as well as wrong and that using them would mean forfeiting personal freedom and a promising future. "I grew up in the 60's," Mr. Clinton said, "when most people your age, when I was your age, they just sort of got into this business. They didn't really believe drugs were dangerous until it nearly destroyed a generation."

VPolice officers investigating a burglary stumbled onto a cache of weapons and fertilizer bomb ingredients, though the amount was much less than what was used in the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168, officials said today. Lieut. Gary Boldizsar of the Corvallis Police Department said no evidence had been found linking the people arrested -- three men and one woman -- to any paramilitary groups or hate groups.

For liberal critics, it's an article of faith that people motivated by religion have no place in American politics. Religious faith is something they're willing to overlook as long as we keep it to ourselves.

VIT used to be that Deborah Cantie wouldn't know where she'd wake up. Life for a addict is like that, she said. Instead of a two-minute egg, she would start with a two-dollar bottle. But that was another day. This morning, the sun cracked through the blinds of Ms. Cantie's bedroom window. The day was fresh and she had things to do. It's good to have a schedule, she said; she hasn't kept one for a very long time. After her morning toilet, Ms. Cantie emerged smelling of cocoa butter, looking composed and crisp.

VIn the latest effort to curtail illegal drug use in Manhattan dance clubs, investigators made eight arrests at two trendy nightspots early Saturday, the police said. Seven people were arrested for sale or possession of cocaine in a police "buy and bust" operation in the Tunnel, 212 12th Avenue, at about 2:30 A.M., said a police spokeswoman, Officer Olga Mercado. The eighth arrest, for sale of marijuana, took place about an hour later at the Palladium, 126 East 14th Street.

VThe excruciating dilemma facing Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx District Attorney, was symbolically set in motion last March with the stroke of a gold Cross pen. The pen had belonged to Sean McDonald, a police officer who had been murdered in the Bronx. Gov. George E. Pataki used it to sign New York's new death penalty law, emphasizing one circumstance under which a death sentence can be pursued: the killing of a police officer.

VWhen they came out of prison last year, the question was whether Angel Diaz, Jesus Mendez and Ricardo Morales would avoid the gang, the guns and the pull of the Bronx streets where they had made a vicious living together in the 1980's, robbing bodegas and jewelry stores and pistol-whipping people for wallets. Released between May and October, they returned to their families -- parents, wives and children -- settled into apartments, reported regularly to parole officers, repeatedly passed drug tests and, by all accounts, were searching for work. Only one found a job and that was quickly lost, but even the prospect of work seemed like progress.

And the Government had proof that he had not worked or filed taxes for 10 years, all the while amassing a $100 million fortune.

VSo, as advertised, "Dateline" went up against "60 Minutes" for the first time, the young shootist drawing against the old pro. Making a judgment on this sort of contest on the basis of a single encounter is like picking the winner in an N.C.A.A. matchup after the first couple of minutes on the court, but the event invites attention. Did Sunday night get a lot more interesting, as the NBC advertisement promised? Did people who did not watch "60 Minutes" have nothing to talk about around the water cooler on Monday, as the CBS ad threatened? We can assume that both sets of producers put their strongest material forward. Most of the "Dateline" hour was given to a worry-of-the-week story about treatment in emergency wards. Here's what you have to lose sleep over this week: If you are carried from an accident in such dire shape that the hospital you wind up at cannot handle you, will you be accepted by a bigger hospital that has the surgeon you need?

VThe Dallas County District Attorney's office said today that it unsuccessfully tried to serve Dallas Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin with a subpoena in connection with a grand jury investigation into a drug arrest. But Irvin's lawyer said his client would "work with the D.A. in this case." Prosecutors were upset this morning when Irvin did not appear at the courthouse. Kevin Clancy, the receiver's lawyer, said Irvin would appear next week.

VAn elaborate sting operation intended to show that the Government is cracking down on marijuana smuggling into Ireland has turned into an embarrassing fiasco involving the police and customs services and a suspected drug dealer known as The Monk. The tale begins last fall, when ministers in the Government of Prime Minister John Bruton and senior police officers announced, with pride flashing and television cameras grinding, the biggest drug bust in Ireland's history: the capture of a truckload of 13 tons of marijuana, worth about about $200 million on the streets. With news organizations alerted in advance, the truck was captured on Nov. 8 by police and customs agents at the southern coast hamlet of Urlingford. But something was missing: perpetrators.

VThe year is 2000. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, having eliminated term limits, is looking ahead to his next campaign, and Gov. George E. Pataki, halfway through his second term, is planning ahead, too. Each has a team of advisers who meet weekly to plot strategy. They are all looking for the same thing: salable issues and slogans to satisfy the public mood. But they are having a hard time. What used to be so easy is no longer. A few things have changed in recent years. The old campaign promises have been kept too well.

VShe wore a blue skirt she bought herself at a local pro shop, she wore blue polish on her nails, and, to complete the color scheme, Jennifer Capriati wore a moderately blue expression this afternoon after being dismissed by Gabriela Sabatini, 6-1, 6-4, in the fourth round of the Lipton Championships. "I guess it makes me realize more things I have trouble with still, and what to work on and adjust to," said Capriati, who will turn 20 on Friday but has already commenced the second of her tennis lives.

VWhat would you say about a stock that paid an annual dividend of 17 percent of the company's share price? What if someone told you the company had enough cash to raise that payout to 23 percent? That is the situation confronting investors in the tobacco business of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, which is the subject of a bitter proxy fight that will be decided next month. Amid reams of bad publicity for tobacco companies, the effective market price for the tobacco part of the company has plunged to $8.55 a share. Yet management says the company can sustain a payout of $1.50 a share, while insurgent shareholders led by Bennett LeBow promise a $2 dividend.

VFor the last decade, Chile has served as the model for economic growth and stability in Latin America, after opening its doors to foreign investment and shifting from military dictatorship to democracy. But like a rising star with a dirty little secret, this enterprising country of 13 million people, nestled on a narrow strip of land between the Andean Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, has also become a major center for drug trafficking and money laundering.

VThe grand jury in Texas investigating an incident involving Michael Irvin, the Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, recessed on Friday night and left unanswered until at least tomorrow the question of whether it would indict Irvin on drug charges or take no action. For the past week and a half, the grand jury has been looking into an incident in the early hours of March 4, when the police in Irving, Tex., said they found Irvin and Alfredo Roberts, a former Cowboy player and a friend of Irvin, in a hotel room with two women, Jasmine Nabwangu and Angela Beck, along with three ounces of marijuana, two ounces of cocaine and drug paraphernalia. Beck, a 22-year-old waitress, said the drugs belonged to her. Only she was arrested.

VLemrick Nelson Jr., the man facing civil rights charges in the fatal attack on a Hasidic scholar during the Crown Heights racial violence in 1991, was acquitted yesterday on charges that he assaulted a police officer last June, charges that his lawyer had argued were the result of police harassment. It was the second time that the Brooklyn District Attorney's office failed to win a conviction of Mr. Nelson in a trial. The first occurred in 1992, when Mr. Nelson was acquitted of charges that he murdered the Hasidic man, Yankel Rosenbaum, by fatally stabbing him during an attack on Hasidic people by bands of young black men during the four days of violence that rocked the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights in August 1991.

VA fire that was deliberately set at a video store in Brooklyn severely burned a 15-year-old girl yesterday, the police said. Fire marshals detected a flammable liquid at the scene of the fire at the Dekalb Video store at 1130 Broadway, and police investigators were searching for three men seen fleeing the store just after the fire erupted, said Doram Tamari, a police spokesman.

VThere is no evidence that the Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis used illegal drugs while he played on the 1986-87 Northeastern University basketball team, an investigating commission reported yesterday. The commission, established last year by JOHN CURRY, the president of Northeastern, found that other members of that team used marijuana and cocaine. Lewis died on July 27, 1993, after he collapsed while shooting baskets. Two doctors said that scarring found on his heart appeared consistent with cocaine use, although an autopsy and subsequent review concluded that an irregular heartbeat caused his death. (AP)

VThe Dallas Cowboys' owner, JERRY JONES, while criticizing MICHAEL IRVIN's judgment, is confident the All-Pro wide receiver doesn't have a drug problem. "Michael has been in the league since 1988 and has never had any positive tests while he has been under the scrutiny of the N.F.L.," Jones said Thursday. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, quoting an unidentified source, reported Thursday that Irvin is risking suspension by not responding to a National Football League letter informing him of plans to enroll him in the league's substance abuse program. Irvin is free on $5,500 bond after his indictment Monday on charges of cocaine and marijuana possession. "I don't know anything about it," Irvin said of the N.F.L. letter. "I need to start talking to you guys and refute some of the stuff that's coming out." (AP)

VTHE Culbro Corporation has long been a quiet company. Its premium cigars, led by the popular Garcia y Vega and Macanudo brands, are puffed at Wall Street gatherings, and it is a big landowner in popular Wall Street getaways like rural Connecticut and Florida. But with a stock market value of less than $300 million, and with half of its shares in insiders' hands, it has never attracted much attention, despite ties to a fabled tobacco dynasty and a board studded with business celebrities.

VAfter a judge moved to drop the charges against him last week, Johann Moore, arrested for selling marijuana to AIDS and cancer patients, said he would continue to distribute the drug for medicinal purposes. Mr. Moore -- who founded the New York Buyer's Club in 1993 to distribute marijuana to patients to relieve suffering, ease nausea and stimulate appetite -- said he was pleased to stay out of jail but had hoped the case would go to trial and establish a legal precedent for medical marijuana in New York.

VThe movement once professed not to trust anyone over 30. But Yippie House -- the Bleecker Street headquarters of the Youth International Party and its offshoots -- is about to pass that dreaded milestone. And after all those years, and all the Yippie breakups and reconfigurations, the three-story storefront building just off the Bowery remains a haven for those taking part in political discussions, pamphleteering and strategy sessions for the effort to legalize marijuana. Some things never change. The big topic of conversation last Sunday night had a very familiar ring to it: the Yippies want to mount a series of protests this summer at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It promises to be a dynastic battle royal, or at least an interesting bit of street theater.

VMICHAEL IRVIN always wanted to be noticed. When he scored a touchdown for the three-time Super Bowl champion Cowboys, he cakewalked through the end zone. When he wasn't being thrown enough passes, he demanded the ball. When he got dressed up, he was as flashy as a pawn-shop window -- gold necklace, diamond bracelet, diamond-studded gold watch, a diamond stud in his left ear. "I'm just having fun," he once said. "I'm a bad example because I enjoy myself? They got me all wrong."

VPhencyclidine, an illegal hallucinogen that first gained notoriety in the late 1960's in its crystalline form as angel dust, has become popular again in the New York area, investigators said yesterday in announcing that they had broken up a large distribution ring for the drug. Nicknamed PCP for its full name, phenylcyclohexylpiperidine, the mood-altering drug has proven popular with young adults who drive in from the suburbs to buy it from street dealers in Harlem.

VNearly every day, before and since President Clinton certified on March 1 that Mexico was a cooperative partner in the fight against drugs, smugglers cross the border around here, through miles of desert scrub and onto isolated highways, with load upon load of narcotics. The hours after Mr. Clinton's announcement were no different, law-enforcement agencies said. Border Patrol agents intercepted a group of smugglers carrying 200 pounds of marijuana in backpacks a few miles west of here. At a roadside checkpoint, agents found 200 pounds of marijuana hidden in a car. At the bustling port of entry, drug-sniffing dogs detected 300 pounds of marijuana in four vehicles, stashed in gas tanks, dashboards and paneling.

VEvery generation thinks it's special -- my grandparents because they remember horses and buggies, my parents because of the Depression. . . . Mine is the generation of unfulfilled expectations. "When you're older," my mother promised, "you can wear lipstick." But when the time came, of course, lipstick wasn't being worn. "When we're big, we'll dance like that," my friends and I whispered, watching Chubby Checker twist on "American Bandstand." But we inherited no dance steps; ours was a limp, formless shrug to watered-down music that rarely made the feet tap. "Just wait till we can vote," I said, bursting with 10-year-old fervor, ready to fast, freeze, march and die for peace and freedom as Joan Baez, barefoot, sang "We Shall Overcome." Well, now we can vote, and we're old enough to attend rallies and knock on doors and wave placards, and suddenly it doesn't seem to matter any more.

VNearly 13,000 young feminists, old leftists, concerned immigrants and even "Angry White Guys for Affirmative Action" joined forces today for a national "Fight the Right" march along the bay. Held here because the National Organization for Women wanted to have a major protest outside of Washington this year, the march was joined by some 500 groups supporting liberal causes, like abortion and gay rights, and celebrities, including Gloria Steinem and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

VA legal group founded by the National Rifle Association gave $20,000 for the defense of Bernhard H. Goetz, who is being sued by a man who was left paralyzed after Mr. Goetz shot him in a Manhattan subway 12 years ago. The contribution is part of the tens of thousands of dollars that the group, the Firearms Civil Rights Legal Defense Fund, parcels out each year to criminal and civil defendants who have used handguns in self-defense. In 1994, the last year for which an annual report is available, the fund spent more than a half million dollars in such cases and in legal challenges to gun control laws.

VThe smuggling is old-fashioned but effective. Under cover of night, airplanes drop large bales of cocaine and marijuana into the sea for retrieval by fast boats that deliver them ashore. Or yachts and other pleasure craft stuffed with illegal drugs in the quaint islands of the Lesser Antilles sail into the harbors of Puerto Rico. With law-enforcement agencies concentrating on stanching the flood of illegal drugs across the Mexican border, narcotics traffickers have increasingly gone back to using Puerto Rico as a major transit point to smuggle more drugs into the United States.

VThe Supreme Court appeared distinctly troubled today by the Federal Government's strategy of both prosecuting drug dealers and seizing their property. But it was evident during a fast-paced argument that the Justices were even more troubled by the implications of ruling that the widely used prosecution-and-forfeiture combination is an unconstitutional form of double jeopardy. An administrative proceeding against a lawyer or stockbroker that leads to a fine and loss of a license is frequently coupled with a criminal prosecution based on the same conduct, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg observed to lawyers for two narcotics defendants. Their successful double jeopardy appeals in lower courts have thrown the Government's forfeiture program into turmoil.

VCould a feisty middle-aged white woman who knows nothing about sports mold a losing black basketball team into high school champions? "Sunset Park," a sentimental comedy that shows a genuine fondness for its characters, would like to think so. This good-natured pipe dream of a movie, set in the wilds of Brooklyn, deals onlq glancingly with the grimmer realities of inner-city life. Drugs, guns, poor education and the threat of prison are only tangential to the story of a team whose scrappy female coach uses psychological canniness to turn losers into winners.

VSEVENTEEN years old, recently jilted by a girlfriend, miserable in the gloom of adolescence and certain that all his roads were blocked, Larry Bresan decided to end it all one day in 1991. Or, at least, to make a statement. He swallowed half a bottle of sleeping pills, but not prescription ones. Actually, Larry Bresan recalled a bit sheepishly, they were over-the-counter Nytols, a mouthful of which are sufficient to make you sick enough to wish you were dead, but not enough to do the job.

VBETWEEN April 14 and April 21, according to Timothy Leary's home page on the World Wide Web, his "average daily input of neuro-active drugs" included 50 cigarettes, a joint of marijuana, two lines of cocaine, 12 balloons of nitrous oxide, 0.45 of a cubic centimeter of ketamine and assorted other intoxicants. For Mr. Leary, whose 1960's motto was "tune in, turn on, drop out," this might seem business as usual, except for the sobering "health summary" that precedes the chronicle of his daily drug intake. "I am developing methods and technologies to delay the ultimate onset of pain, coma, helplessness and indignity which await," he writes to all who stop by his incongruously cheery home page. "Hi-Tech Designer Dying is occupying most of my time."

VAlthough nearly four years have passed since the Supreme Court narrowly reaffirmed the status of abortion as a constitutional right, an action -- or, more accurately, a nonaction -- by the Court in an abortion case today demonstrated how highly charged the issue remains for the Justices. Over a barbed dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court refused to hear South Dakota's appeal of a ruling that its law requiring teen-agers seeking abortions to notify a parent 48 hours in advance was unconstitutional.

VConcealed inside the trunks, wheel wells and other crannies of hundreds of nondescript trucks and cars, the cocaine from Colombia rolls across the Mexican border and into Los Angeles, where it is repackaged for distribution to other illegal drug markets around the country. Mexican smugglers account for as much as 70 percent of the cocaine entering the United States, drug agency officials say, and take payment not in cash but in kind: a kilogram of cocaine for every kilo they deliver for the Colombian drug cartel based in Cali.

VIt was just one at-bat. A man once considered one of baseball's most dominating pitchers was struggling to re-establish himself in the sport. It was a tight spot, and he was challenging one of the most dominating hitters in the game. But if Dwight Gooden actually is back, as his six scoreless innings last night against the Chicago White Sox at Yankee Stadium suggest, you might want to remember the inside fastball that Gooden fired past Frank Thomas on a 1-2 count with two men on and nobody out in the third inning of a scoreless contest in early May.

VTHE MOSSY SMELL OF marijuana was wafting from row to row and seat to seat, where heads were bobbing to the music. There were men in ponytails and bandannas. There were women wearing an early Judy Collins look -- scant makeup and hair plunging long and straight from a perfect center part. Sure, there were some square pillars of respectability scattered about. Many were still in their office uniforms and sported haircuts that Richard Nixon would have approved of. But for the most part this was a hippie crowd, come to see "Tull." Jethro Tull, that is -- the English band of minstrels that aspired to poetry in its folk ballads and scaled the decibel heights with its electric guitars. The leader of the group, Ian Anderson, was in chatty form this rainy night, introducing each crowd favorite -- "Cross-Eyed Mary," "Aqualung," "Nothing Is Easy" -- in his crisp, Oxbridge baritone, inviting waves of laughter with his wry wit. And the crowd, of course, was loving it. It was just like the old days.

VAS part of a continuing effort to end illegal drug use in the county's homeless shelters, five people at the Westhab transitional shelter in Elmsford have been arrested in the last few weeks and charged with drug dealing and possession. The arrests followed an undercover investigation in which two county police officers lived at the shelter during the winter. Last fall, a similar investigation at the Coachman Hotel in White Plains resulted in the arrests of some residents there.

VThe Dallas Cowboys star MICHAEL IRVIN, currently under felony indictment in connection with the seizure of cocaine and marijuana in a March 4 raid on an Irving, Tex., motel room, bought cocaine before and after the raid, KXAS-TV reported last night. Irvin paid $100 for drugs two days before his April 1 indictment, the Fort Worth station reported. The report was accompanied by a videotape clandestinely shot from the back seat of a vehicle in which Irvin was riding.

VWhat's the the value of a degree from Southern California? More than $17.6 million, apparently. At least that's how much wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson has turned down from the Jets. The team opened talks with its top draft choice -- who graduates from U.S.C. on Friday -- by offering him a five-year contract worth $2.4 million a year, plus a $5.6 million signing bonus.

VThe New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is a time when a city that celebrates anything and everything celebrates itself. Though pop and world music stars like Joan Osborne and Salif Keita performed at the 27th annual festival, which attracted a record crowd of 472,000 from April 26 to May 5, the personality of the event was shaped by the diverse array of indigenous musicians. The call-and-response chants of Mardi Gras Indian tribes, the envelope-pushing jazz of Kidd Jordan, the spellbinding rhythm-and-blues of the Neville Brothers, the swamp pop of Tommy McLain, the zydeco of Boozoo Chavis, even the Yiddish stompers of the New Orleans Klezmer Allstars and the burlesque of the Chris Owens Show were all stamped with a sound that was unmistakably Louisiana.

VA jury in an upscale Detroit suburb today convicted the parents of a wayward teen-ager of a criminal misdemeanor for failing to control him. The case has caught the attention of a nation at once alarmed by soaring juvenile crime rates and concerned about punishing parents for their children's misbehavior. The jury deliberated less than half an hour before convicting Susan and Anthony Provenzino of St. Clair Shores, Mich., of violating a city ordinance that requires parents "to exercise reasonable parental control" over children under 18.

VA police unit equipped with a battering ram and a sledgehammer and carrying a search warrant burst into the Jameel Grocery, a bodega under the rusting tracks of the Z train in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and arrested three clerks one day last week on charges that they sold marijuana to an undercover officer. As they handcuffed the clerks, one, Eric Harrell, 24, gratified the officers by saying that other bodegas across Brooklyn were beginning to lay off the drug trade because "everybody's scared of the police."

VIn the latest troubles for the beleaguered Culbro Corporation, three men have been indicted on charges that they used a false billing scheme to cheat a Culbro cigar plant in Dothan, Ala., out of nearly $1 million. The police had stumbled onto the case last year during an unrelated drug investigation, United States Attorney Redding Pitt said today. That investigation began after a customer found a brick of marijuana in a shipment of company cigars.

VJuan Garcia Abrego was among the first Mexican drug lords to forge ties to the Cali cartel in Colombia, helping to transform Mexico's drug business from a backwoods marijuana operation into a $4-billion-a-year industry supplying Americans with tons of cocaine. Mr. Garcia Abrego's bribes, brutality and business acumen were a borderlands legend through the 1980's and early 1990's. But by 1995 his powers were on the wane. His most influential Government patrons had left office, a lieutenant was running his organization's day-to-day operations, even his Colombian suppliers had cut him off.

Smith spent the weekend in Barcelona, Spain, helping to promote the World League, the N.F.L.'s spring European football league. Yesterday, Smith was in Central Park along with other prominent N.F.L. players to help NFL Properties, the marketing arm of the league, start its "Play Football" campaign. It is aimed at getting children ages 6 to 11 interested in playing, watching and attending football games through programs such as flag football leagues and the Punt, Pass and Kick competition.

VWhen a swarm of hippies, squatters and assorted idealists invaded an abandoned military base in the heart of Copenhagen and called it Free City of Christiania, few believed that they would be staying long. But this year residents of Christiania, named for King Christian IV, who ruled Denmark in the early 17th century, will celebrate the 25th anniversary of their takeover. Their experiment in communal urban living is both a beacon and a warning to those who dream of escaping the strictures of conventional life.

VThe owner of three of Manhattan's largest nightclubs was accused yesterday of turning two of them -- the Limelight and the Tunnel -- into virtual drug supermarkets, peddling the drug known as Ecstasy to a clientele made up largely of college students and teen-agers. Zachary W. Carter, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a written statement that Peter Gatien, one of the reigning nightclub promoters in New York, had "installed a management structure" at the Limelight and the Tunnel that was "designed to ensure successful distribution" of Ecstasy to nightclub patrons, and that the sale of Ecstasy "was the centerpiece of the operation of these clubs, not just a lucrative illegal sideline."

VAfter 35 years on Capitol Hill, after more than a decade of leading the Republicans in the Senate, after establishing himself in the eyes of voters and politicians as the very emblem of Congress and its values, Bob Dole sought yesterday with a single dramatic stroke to recast himself as an outsider. It was a bold maneuver, full of potential perils -- not least the possibility that an electorate weary of tactics and stratagems would see his resignation from the Senate as just another gimmick rather than the symbol of new departure that he intends. Dire straits dictate dramatic remedies, and although it is still early, many Republicans felt Mr. Dole needed to act promptly to energize his flagging campaign.

VTHE way Mike Kim remembers it, his wife and 4-year-old daughter were visiting his tiny Greenwich Village shop, Wild Thing, on March 19 when a dozen police officers stormed in, their guns drawn. After handcuffing two employees, smashing doors and stripping the shelves bare of stuffed animals, T-shirts and candles, the police hauled away $12,000 worth of merchandise they deemed contraband. After taking aim at roving squeegee men and those who imbibe alcohol in public, Mayor Giuliani's campaign against those who violate the quality of city life is expanding to include the Village's head shops, 22 stores that stock ornate pipes, waist-high water bongs and an array of accouterments that the police say are used to smoke marijuana and hashish. Operation Triad, as Manhattan South's narcotics unit has named the sweeps, has targeted 13 head shops in the Village, yielding 20 arrests and more than 100 garbage bags of merchandise.

VMay is never an easy month for the most important man behind the world's most important auto race. There are his "guests," as Tony George, the president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, likes to refer to the 350,000 or so people who turn up for the party called the Indianapolis 500. Even minor things, like asking them to please stay off the new golf course in the speedway infield, sometimes require George's personal attention.

VTHE JUNKIES IN IRVINE Welsh's nasty first novel, "Trainspotting," call it "street cred" -- street credibility, what the well-heeled, adventure-hungry women in London hope to acquire when they go out slumming. All you can do with these "weekend zanies" is sleep with them, says one of Welsh's addict-heroes, "take from them, and then go. They even give you the impression that they'd be disappointed if you did anything else." Wannabe bohemians in New York have found a safer way to acquire the illusion of hipness. They can go see the musical "Rent" on Broadway, watch the new video of Larry Clark's movie "Kids" or read Welsh's novel, which has just been published in the States. (The movie version opens here in July.)

VIt was a steamy Tuesday evening in the Stapleton housing project, not very different from the one two days earlier when a bottle-throwing melee erupted between the police and residents and 10 people were hurt and 8 arrested. But as Officers James Cruz and Gerard Carter patrolled the Staten Island development, the most serious confrontation they faced was between a crying 12-year-old named David and his teen-age cousin Lonnie. As David told the housing officers that Lonnie had tried to steal his bicycle, Lonnie threatened David with a beating once "we get upstairs."

VIn Massachusetts, Kennedys run for office as favorite sons; in neighboring Rhode Island, they're favorite cousins. Their name is so magical that Patrick J. Kennedy, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's youngest child, was elected to the Rhode Island legislature when he was still a 20-year-old junior at Providence College. Observers who yelled carpetbagger just didn't get it. Rhode Island voters welcomed him as if he were a rich, distant relative who had finally invited himself to dinner. Joshua Seftel's colorful, absorbing documentary, "Taking On the Kennedys," (presented as part of the "P.O.V" series on PBS) picks up this story six years later, in 1994, when Patrick Kennedy was elected to Congress from Rhode Island. The film follows the campaign from the point of view of Mr. Kennedy's Republican opponent, a mild-mannered physician and political newcomer named Kevin Vigilante.

VIn a case raising an important issue of political free speech, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether parties have a constitutional right to choose candidates who have already been nominated by another party. The appearance of a candidate on more than one party line -- Republican and Conservative, for example -- creates what are known as fusion tickets and is a common feature of Election Day life in New York and a relative handful of other states. But most states ban fusion tickets, thus relegating minor parties to the fringes and depriving them of the leverage they could gain by offering or withholding a second ballot line to a major-party candidate.

VTimothy Leary, who effectively introduced many Americans to the psychedelic 1960's with the relentlessly quoted phrase, "turn on, tune in, drop out," died yesterday at his house in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 75. However indelible his connection with another era, Mr. Leary was very much a man of the moment, and made his death a final act of performance art by having video cameras record it for possible broadcast on the Internet. He had planned a celebration, and Web sites had collected Leary memorabilia -- texts of his books and lectures, tributes from friends, a listing of his daily drug intake, legal and illegal -- from the time he was told last year that he had prostate cancer.

VHere today, gone tomorrow is how the ever-expanding business of sartorial piracy works. So if you really want one of those cultural icons that are turning up stoned on T-shirts, backpacks and other necessities of life on the rave, get 'em while they're hot. The idea is to stay one silk-screening ahead of the copyrightinfringement squad. The cockeyed T-shirt above, a Disney rip-off known as the Rat on Acid, is already history at the Manhattan boutique-cum-record-store where it was bought just a few weeks ago. The practice is "inexcusable," says John Fread, a spokesman for Adidas, whose distinctive trefoil logo has been contorted into marijuana leaves in head shops all over the place. "We pursue everything, no matter if it's 10 or 10,000 T-shirts."

VThere was the time Bruce Anderson published a satirical list of 107 people whom he described as potential satanic child molesters in Mendocino County. Or the hullabaloo Mr. Anderson raised when he fabricated an interview in which the area's Congressman called his constituents "know-nothing malcontents" who mainly cared about "where their next joint is coming from." The ruckus-raising editor of an alternative weekly newspaper in the small northern California town of Boonville, Mr. Anderson has tested the limits of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech before.

VTimothy Leary had been fired from Harvard four years before we arrived as freshmen, but it's still appropriate that his obituary was front-page news as the class of 1971 returned for its 25th reunion this week. We were the 60's kids whose anti-war protests, wreathed in marijuana smoke, brought police to Harvard Yard and whose strike for multicultural causes brought classes to a halt. If you want to locate the epicenter of the boomer elite that so many Americans, especially those who despise Bill Clinton, love to hate, here we are. Lani Guinier was in our class; so was Franklin Raines, the President's next budget czar. So was Charles Schumer, the Clintonite Congressman from New York. And so were all manner of draft-dodging potheads. The number of classmates who avoided military service in Vietnam by opting for medical school alone could staff an urban hospital. Our sole heroic war casualty was Jonathan Netanyahu, brother of Benjamin, who dropped out to join the Israeli Army and was killed at Entebbe.

VFive days after getting eliminated from the French Open, JENNIFER CAPRIATI faces battery charges for an incident on Sunday night at a club in Tampa, Fla. According to the police, Capriati got into an argument with her boyfriend at Bubba's Beach Club. A punch intended for her boyfriend instead found the left eye of a waitress, ANGELA LARSON, who was standing nearby, a report said. STEVE COLE, a police spokesman, said the state attorney's office would determine whether battery charges would be filed against the 20-year-old Capriati,who rejoined the tennis circuit earlier this year after two stints in drug rehabilitation and after being arrested in Florida two years ago for marijuana possession.

VThe Exxon Corporation won $250 million yesterday from Lloyd's of London underwriting syndicates and other insurers that sold policies to protect the oil company from liabilities like those incurred after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. A Texas state court jury voted 11 to 1 that the insurance underwriters should honor a policy that covered Exxon as the owner of some 11 million gallons of oil spilled into Prince William Sound, Alaska, in 1989.

VProsecutors vowed today to seek new indictments quickly after drug possession charges against Dallas Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin and two topless dancers were thrown out on a technicality. State District Judge Manny Alvarez dismissed the charges because a member of the grand jury that indicted Irvin lived in Tarrant County, not Dallas County. Because the case is still pending, Alvarez cautioned that a gag order was still in effect.

VEyes can't help looking up on entering the Galaxy. Grand Central Terminal has its constellations, and the Galaxy has its stars, hundreds of twinkling bits of light glittering against a dark blue ceiling. Once, the Galaxy was a little Greek diner, where ragged teen-agers refueled on coffee and eggs after midnight, their ears still ringing from the rock-and-roll show at Irving Plaza next door. But a new owner, Denis Cicero, gutted and transformed the Galaxy, retaining only the name. In its place is a sleek, unusual, highly personal restaurant that borrows from cuisines around the world, showcasing the global vision of Mr. Cicero and the controlled creativity of the chef, Deborah Stanton.

VIt is a tale often told in the Clinton White House: a young, enthusiastic, inexperienced campaign aide, his ambitions of working in the West Wing fulfilled, finds himself under scrutiny by hostile Congressional investigators and facing a date with a Federal grand jury. That is the story of Craig Livingstone, chief of White House personnel security. A decade ago, Mr. Livingstone was a gofer carrying garment bags for big-time politicians. He has wound up holding a subpoena and trying to explain why he helped obtain F.B.I. background files on Republicans for the White House.

VFor five hours on April 22, Secretary of State Warren Christopher held intense discussions with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria at his presidential palace in Damascus to end the fighting between Israel and Muslim guerrillas in southern Lebanon. While Mr. Christopher paid court, a few miles away at Damascus International Airport an Iran Air 747 unloaded Katyusha rockets and other military equipment for delivery via Syrian military trucks for those guerrillas, American intelligence officials believe.

VAs if it wasn't enough for Grant Stiles to devote his life to honeybees, his dog has done the same. Buck, a three-year-old black Labrador retriever, can sniff out hives infected with American Foulbrood, a deadly bacterial disease that affects honeybee larvae. Mr. Stiles says only one other dog in the country -- owned by a bee inspector in Maryland -- is trained to detect the disease.

VPRESIDENT CLINTON is calling for curfew laws and a computer chip and rating system that would prevent children from watching TV programs their parents find objectionable. The Christian Coalition and some conservatives are advocating laws asserting the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit at the same time other conservatives are pushing laws holding parents responsible for children go astray. Like the old adage about war being too important to leave to the generals, parenting is now viewed as too important to leave to the parents.

VWHEN THE ROCK band God Street Wine goes on the road this summer, Debbie Yi and three friends are going with them. "We're going to pack the car and do the whole trip, as many shows as we can," said Ms. Yi, who is 17 and lives in Rye, N.Y. She has been a fan of the band for four years and began traveling to its shows up and down the East Coast two years ago. "I've been as far as Washington to see them," she said. "If they get within 10 hours of New York, we're definitely going." Ms. Yi and her friends are at the vanguard of what could be described as tourhead culture, made up of a small but growing number -- perhaps 5,000 during the peak summer months, according to bands, promoters and fans -- of mostly middle-class, college-age young people who like to hit the road in pursuit of fun, music and adventure. Call it turning on, tuning in and dropping out, 90's style.

VDallas Cowboys receiver MICHAEL IRVIN's drug-possession trial will begin next Tuesday, a Dallas court ruled yesterday. Irvin and two topless dancers were re-indicted Friday, two days after a judge voided the original charges because a member of the grand jury that indicted them April 1 lived outside the county. Legal problems for the three stem from March 4 drug arrests at an Irving, Tex., motel. Irvin was charged with felony cocaine possession and misdemeanor marijuana possession. If convicted, he could face 20 years in prison. (AP)

VBob Dole came to California with a message to deliver: that President Clinton was weak on defense and had hurt the state's mammoth defense industry. But Mr. Dole's own earlier remarks on tobacco have been dogging him here -- he has even been trailed by a person dressed as a cigarette -- and he has had to keep swatting at those echoes like so many flies at a picnic. California has some of the most stringent anti-smoking laws in the country. So Californians paid attention when Mr. Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, suggested during a trip to tobacco-producing Kentucky last week that tobacco was not addictive and compared the ability to quit smoking to the ability to drink milk. (Some can. Some can't.)

VLawyers renewed their pretrial jousting today in the drug case of Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin. Indictments for cocaine and marijuana possession against Irvin and two women were thrown out last week when it was discovered that a member of the grand jury lived outside the county. The three were quickly re-indicted on the same charges, and a hearing on several defense motions, including one to keep out evidence seized at a motel near Texas Stadium on March 4, was started again.

VThese are bad times for Peter Gatien, the fallen nightclub king of New York's under-25 world. He was indicted last month by a Federal grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the drug Ecstasy at two of his clubs, Limelight and the Tunnel, places the United States Attorney's office described as drug supermarkets. He is under investigation for tax evasion. He may lose his liquor license. In an era of crackdown on clubs by City Hall and the police, he managed to scrape together his $1 million bail after two weeks in jail only by borrowing money from his parents, his brothers, two friends and his former wife.

VSubstantially watering down California's tough "three-strikes" sentencing law, the state's highest court ruled today that judges had the right to disregard a defendant's prior convictions if they thought a mandatory prison sentence would be too cruel. The decision by the State Supreme Court is retroactive, meaning that most of the estimated 16,000 people who were sentenced to stiffer prison terms under the 1994 "three-strikes law" because they had multiple felony convictions can now appeal. The ruling allows them to argue that the judges who imposed their sentences were deprived of the discretionary role afforded the judiciary under the State Constitution.

VWAY out there, it's a colossal 3-D Super Spirograph. The Milky Way spins; inside it, separately, the solar system spins, and its components, the planets, are spinning, too. Yo-yos twirling on a string called gravity, they zoom close to the sun and slow down at the far end of the circuit. That's where the tilted Earth is now: toward the far end of its solar orbit. On Thursday night, for a moment called the solstice, while the gravity string was stretched near its farthest, the North Pole's solar exposure was greatest, introducing the day our hemisphere celebrates as the first day of summer. It's not really New York's only longest day of the year: scientists count count 15 hours 6 minutes and a varying number of seconds of light every day from June 17 to June 24, a quantity that will only slowly dwindle.

Howe, who was suspended from baseball seven times for substance abuse violations, was planning to travel to his home in Whitefish, Mont., with his wife, Cynthia, on a Delta flight when Luviger Carter, a Port Authority police officer, detected the pistol in his luggage and confiscated it at about 4 P.M., according to Tom Middlemiss, a spokesman for the Port Authority police.

VMICHAEL IRVIN, the All-Pro wide receiver of the Dallas Cowboys, must stand trial on drug charges, a judge ruled yesterday in rejecting several motions to have evidence suppressed and the indictment thrown out. Criminal District Court Judge MANNY ALVAREZ ruled on the defense motions after a daylong hearing at a Dallas County courthouse. He also issued a gag order on all parties in the case. The trial is set to begin today with jury selection.

VIn a major victory for Federal prosecutors, the Supreme Court ruled today that the Government can both prosecute someone for a crime and seize his property through civil forfeiture without violating the constitutional bar against double jeopardy. The double-barreled prosecution and forfeiture strategy, a cornerstone of the Government's approach to narcotics crimes, had been meeting increasing resistance in the lower courts. Two Federal appeals courts, in rulings the Court overturned in a single decision today, had found the approach a violation of the Fifth Amendment, which the Court has interpreted as prohibiting multiple punishments for the same offense.

VSkipping past recent precedents and ignoring common sense, the Supreme Court went overboard this week in affirming the Government's authority to prosecute narcotics dealers and seize their property. A majority of eight justices were so anxious to avoid tampering with this cornerstone of the Government's anti-drug strategy that they ignored an important fact. Not all civil forfeitures are alike. Properly targeted, asset-seizure laws are a valuable weapon against affluent drug dealers, some of whom fear losing their wealth more than prison. Prosecutors favor the civil forfeiture approach because it requires a lower standard of proof than the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard needed for a criminal conviction. Indeed, the Government can seize a drug suspect's property even in the absence of a criminal conviction.

VTo the Editor: A June 23 news article is inaccurate in stating that the American Medical Association "shelved" a draft report by an outside expert advocating, among other things, the legalization of marijuana. Other drug policy experts asked by the A.M.A. to review the draft were critical of the report's recommendations. As a result, it is unlikely the initial draft will complete the A.M.A. process intact. That process is moving forward.

The jury pool started the day with 67 members, but was cut to 65 when one person failed to show up and another was excused because of a scheduling conflict. It was trimmed to 57 when 8 prospective panelists said they had formed opinions as to Irvin's guilt or innocence because of news media coverage.

VJealousy over a woman, perhaps even two, emerged today as one possible motive in the bizarre case of a Dallas police officer charged with trying to hire a professional killer to murder Michael Irvin, a marquee player for the Super Bowl-champion Dallas Cowboys. But law-enforcement investigators said they were also examining the possibility that Mr. Irvin, who is on trial on drug-possession charges, had threatened harm to the officer's girlfriend if she testified against him.

VThe Minnesota Timberwolves, riding an enormous boost from the draft-day trade that netted STEPHON MARBURY, suffered an embarrassing setback yesterday when ISAIAH RIDER was charged with possession of marijuana and possession of an illegal cellular telephone, both misdemeanors, after he was arrested Thursday in Oakland, Calif. Rider's arrest dominated a news conference yesterday to introduce Marbury, and may delay the Wolves' efforts to trade him. A reported deal involving the 25-year-old swingman with the Portland Trail Blazers had appeared imminent.

VSIX years ago, Joseph Simmons's life was a shambles. Better known as Run from the pioneering rap duo Run-D.M.C., Mr. Simmons was depressed over his failing marriage and sputtering career. After the group sold 10 million albums in the mid-1980's, Run-D.M.C.'s fifth release, ''Back From Hell,'' sold just 500,000 copies in 1990.

VTHERE IS HELL HERE IN PARADISE. AND TONY WHEELER -- the multimillionaire co-founder of the Lonely Planet travel empire and trailblazing patron saint of the world's backpackers and adventure travelers -- has journeyed halfway across the South Pacific to ferret it out. The rail-thin 49-year-old Briton is standing on a lush stretch of the Rue du Pont Neuf in Papeete, the capital of French Polynesia and the largest city on the island of Tahiti. The scene is just as Gauguin left it, the warm, moist sea air perfumed by cascades of hibiscus and jasmine.

VI paid a price," Dr. Eyad Sarraj said, "but I have no regrets for that. My imprisonment helped the cause of human rights in a way. It made people understand the importance of freedom of expression." Dr. Sarraj is a psychiatrist in Gaza and the head of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens' Rights. I spoke with him on the telephone a few days after his release from a Gaza prison: his second time inside since he criticized the Palestinian Authority as oppressive.

VA woman who had been convicted of marijuana possession two years ago was the only black juror chosen yesterday for the 12-member panel in MICHAEL IRVIN's drug-possession trial. The only other minority member on the six-man, six-woman jury is an Asian woman. Both alternates are women; one is black. "This is not a jury of his peers," the defense attorney RON GORANSON said.

VA dozen times in the last six years, the police have swept through a corner of this village arresting hundreds of people on drug charges. Now, with the state's help, the police have completed a three-month investigation, much of it on videotape, and arrested 156 people. And this time, the authorities pledged to do more. Citing poor security and a host of building code violations, they filed suit against a real estate holding company, Bedell Terrace.

VFor the goofy, laid-back heroes of "Pick Up Ax," Anthony Clarvoe's engaging business manual of a comedy at the 29th Street Repertory Theater, it's still possible to be a corporate executive without having blood on your hands. Still in their 20's, Brian Weiss (Thomas Wehrle) and Keith Rienzi (Neil Necastro) run their multimillion-dollar Silicon Valley company with minds clouded by marijuana smoke and a blissful ignorance of the competitive instinct. But as the play's program points out, this all takes place "many generations in the past," i.e., the early 1980's. An economic revolution, couched in Darwinian language and a new spirit of aggression, is afoot. And it will spell the end for the age of innocence of what the play's third character, Mick Palomar (David Mogentale), an enterprising trouble-shooter from the world of "heavy industry," speculates may be America's last growth industry.

At campaign events, the costumed Butt Man -- animated by different Democrats directed from party headquarters -- has been popping up in crowds, gaining press coverage by waving stubby arms and passing out fake dollar bills that show "Smokin' Bob Dole" puffing on a scribbled-in cigarette.

VVeronica Guerin, the prominent Irish investigative reporter who was shot to death in her car on June 26, was a relative newcomer to journalism who took her trade by storm. In 1995, just five years after she started in the business, she began reporting on the largest heist in Irish history, in which a gang penetrated a supposedly secure depot near Dublin airport and took $4.4 million. She interviewed one suspect and without identifying him wrote a detailed story. A few days later an intruder entered her home and, after putting a pistol to her head, lowered it and shot her in the leg.

Mr. Mara, 32 and Connecticut-born, says he then made a horrible mistake: he opened his eyes and looked up. That apparently broke a rule that before eating, each inmate should close his eyes and look downward.

VDefense attorneys attacked a police officer's account of events and officers' evidence-collecting procedures as the felony drug possession trial for MICHAEL IRVIN resumed in Dallas yesterday with yet another twist. The Dallas Cowboys receiver was subpoenaed to testify at an examining hearing for JOHNNIE HERNANDEZ, the former Dallas police officer who is accused of trying to hire a hitman to kill Irvin. JOHN H. READ, an attorney for Hernandez, said he wanted Irvin to testify about reported threats against Hernandez's girlfriend, RACHELLE SMITH. Both Hernandez and Smith have been subpoenaed as potential witnesses in Irvin's trial.

VBAM MORRIS, the leading rusher of the Super Bowl and a Texas high school and college football star, was fined $7,000 for possessing marijuana yesterday but avoided jail time. The former Pittsburgh Steelers running back, who was released Tuesday, had faced up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $10,000. Instead, he was given six years' deferred adjudication, meaning the drug charges could eventually be removed from his record.

VHerschel Walker and the Dallas Cowboys met, talked and pondered their needs in recent days, then left with this idea: Let's do it again. And so they have. Almost seven years after being the key figure in one of the National Football League's biggest trades, Walker is back for his second stint in Dallas after signing as a free agent today. The running back was released by the Giants after one season on June 18, and it did not take him long to find a new home at an old address.

VRAYMOND MAKORI, 19, has his eye on a car, a sporty used Mitsubishi Starion. So at 3 P.M. five times a week -- more often, if he can get the overtime -- he takes a bus from his home here to the gatehouse at the sprawling Panasonic headquarters in Secaucus to begin an eight-hour shift as a security guard. There would be nothing unusual about Raymond's $6-an-hour job, or his dream of new wheels, if it were not for the way he plans to use them. "I need a car so I can get a second job on weekends," he said the other day. "I have to pay part of the household bills and the rent." And he has to pay nearly $3,000 a year for tuition (and help pay it for his younger brother and sisters) at St. Aloysius High School in Jersey City, where he will be a senior in the fall.

VRAYMOND MAKORI, 19, has his eye on a car, a sporty used Mitsubishi Starion. So at 3 P.M. five times a week -- more often, if he can get the overtime -- he takes a bus from his home here to the gatehouse at the sprawling Panasonic headquarters in...

VTHIS is no success story, at least not yet. "My mother kicked me, hit me with her hand, a stick," said Andres Andino, who is now 43. "She had five kids, nobody knew about stress, depression then. I think she couldn't stand how much I looked like my father. One day I stopped crying. I wasn't going to let her see my pain. All the anger got stuck inside me. "I went out on the street and I paid her back -- drugs, armed robbery. I cut guys up. And I look around up here, and I can cry now seeing all the kids who remind me of me." Mr. Andino, a handsome, muscular man, had just finished mowing the grass of a baseball field on 100th Street between First and Second Avenues that belongs to Harlem RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities), a privately supported program of games and mentors for about 225 local youngsters from 7 to 18. Last summer, mellow on heroin, Mr. Andino looked out of a nearby apartment window and saw Inge Hanson, the group's executive director, struggling to set down the white-powder foul lines. A former ballplayer with more than a dash of macho, he came downstairs to show her how. He soon became a volunteer, then a coach. It was a fellow coach, Mike Colon, who found Mr. Andino when he bottomed out in a stairwell last March. He was bleeding from self-inflicted slashes on his arms. He had swallowed 90 pills, Prozac, Benadryl and Valium. Mr. Colon brought him to Metropolitan Hospital nearby, where he went through yet another detox. Ms. Hanson got him into the rehab program at Holliswood Hospital in Queens. He was there a little more than a month. He's been clean for almost four. "I consider this the longest ever," he said. "Once I didn't use for six months, but I had reservations -- it was to get through parole. In the upstate prisons it's too hard to get drugs, so I don't count that either. "I started using marijuana in Franklin K. Lane High School. My mother gave me $7.50 every day. That was my share of my father's Social Security. He got stabbed to death by a girlfriend he was abusing. I'd buy cigarettes, weed, Gypsy Rose wine. I'd gamble on handball games; I was very good, took money off the African kids in Bedford-Stuyvesant. "We'd bring junior high school girls back to the apartment. My mother was a seamstress in the garment center. I got busted by a neighbor. My mother came home early and there was two couples in her bed. She swept us out of the house with her broom." Mr. Andino dropped out of high school. He wandered back and forth from his native Puerto Rico. He began using heroin at 18. He had jobs -- five years loading trucks, seven years in the garment center in which he rose to fabric cutter, even some cooking -- but the getting, selling and using of heroin always brought him down. He was arrested 10 times and spent more than 3 1/2 years behind bars. It was often easier to use in city jails than on the street, he said, because your family would always send you money in jail, figuring you couldn't get dope there. On the outside, he went into detox programs to placate his wife, a city employee who supported him and their two children and four more of her own. She looked down on him, he says, as a "dirty IV user." She considered her cocaine habit "sophisticated." They are separated after 16 years, and she is now in a rehab program, but their two children have been placed in foster care. His goal, he says, is to get them back. He makes a little money from RBI and has begun living with a girlfriend who has some money of her own, in Westchester. * Kids from the neighborhood projects began drifting onto the block, smacking their gloves, making their way under a hot sun to the ballfield. The scent of the fresh-mowed grass tickled nostrils. "People look at me, they say, 'Andy, you come a long way, you look good,' and that sometimes scares me," he said. "I got to remember where I been, how low and dirty. I remember one time, I was messing around in my marriage; I'm a fool for girls, skinny girls, and this girl gave me a bunch of flowers after a weekend we spent together. "I went home and gave the roses to my wife. That is dirty. And I used to con the parole officers by turning in my own kids' urine for my tests. That's dirty. "But that's why these kids here can trust me and talk to me. I know everything you can do bad. When they cry, I feel good; it means the anger's coming out. "Sometimes I'm shaky and scared for myself. I'm always scared for them because I am what happens if someone doesn't rescue them."

VMichael Irvin sought that exciting push, that explosiveness off the line of scrimmage that had become his style, but it simply was not there. It was training camp in 1990 and this Dallas Cowboys receiver was only a few months back from major reconstructive surgery on his right knee. It was only his third season in the National Football League after a memorable career at the University of Miami. The Cowboys were practicing against the San Diego Chargers at the Chargers' facility in La Jolla, Calif. Off the line came Irvin. The defensive backs matched him stride for stride -- there would be no separation since Irvin could not break free because of the bum knee.

VIn the three months since a tougher new counterterrorism bill was signed into law, many immigrants who have been living legally in the United States for years have been placed in detention by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and are facing deportation. Under provisions in the new law, any resident immigrant who is not a naturalized citizen and has been convicted of a crime in the United States, including most felonies and certain misdemeanors, can be detained without appeal and is not eligible for release on bond, according to I.N.S. officials. Many have been arrested as they tried to re-enter the country after trips abroad.

VOf several hundred Clinton Administration officials who were screened for access to the White House in late 1993 and early 1994, about 40 had a history of drug use that went beyond youthful experimentation, Secret Service agents said today. The agents told a House panel that the Secret Service initially rejected passes to the executive mansion for an unspecified number of White House employees, fearing that their drug use would compromise White House security. The employees, who were not identified, ultimately got passes after the Administration set up a special drug-testing program in early 1994.

In addition, discussions are under way with half a dozen other countries to allow the United States to enter their waters to intercept shipments of cocaine and marijuana bound for American territory.

VWading hip-deep in the sparkling Esopus Creek, two men cast delicate trout flies into green swirling pools. In a forested retreat in the woods nearby, Zen Buddhists meditate. A hundred yards away, inside a former grain silo painted with blue sky, white clouds and a pair of eyes, 12 tourists stand in darkness and throbbing music and stare up at a seemingly levitating orb of swirling patterns, including images of crouching American Indians, past presidents and marijuana leaves.

VIn his radio message today, Bob Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, blamed "three years of misguided policies of the Clinton Administration" for an increase in drug use. Winning the drug war, he said, would be difficult in part because President Clinton "cut the staff of the Office of National Drug Policy by 80 percent," because of "a message that drugs are O.K. or harmless fun," and because of what he described as the Administration's silence on the matter.

VWHEN Raymond O'Connell was the principal of Stratford High School, he often met after school with James Ewing, a history teacher, for long chats on subjects that interested them. One topic that kept coming up, Mr. Ewing said, was "the lack of ethical literacy." It seemed to them that Americans no longer knew right from wrong. Mr. O'Connell, who was appointed superintendent of Stratford's schools a few years ago, said he continued to mull over the nation's ethical dilemma until last spring, when he decided to do something about it. Mr. Ewing was retiring, so Mr. O'Connell asked him to serve as chairman of a committee that would determine how to add character development to the Stratford public school curricuIum. "We had no idea what we wanted to do," Mr. Ewing said. "We were just expressing our concerns at first."

VPresident Clinton may not have inhaled when he smoked marijuana in his youth, but several other White House officials apparently did that and a lot more. About 40 White House employees screened for passes to the executive mansion in late 1993 and early 1994 had drug histories that made them security risks, including abuse of crack cocaine, Secret Service agents told Congress last week. The aides agreed to drug testing to gain security clearance.

VIn a move that came as no surprise, but dealt a significant blow to the defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys, National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue yesterday suspended Michael Irvin, the team's Pro Bowl receiver and one of its most vocal leaders, for the first five games of the 1996 season. The ban came nine days after Irvin halted his trial in Dallas by pleading no contest to a felony charge of cocaine possession. Irvin, who will miss almost a third of his salary for the 1996 season ($513,000), will not be eligible to play until the Cowboys' Oct. 13 game against Arizona. He will miss the Giant game at Dallas on Sept. 8.

VTHE CRASH Crippled Jet Flew for 24 Seconds Radar records show that T.W.A. Flight 800 continued to fly for at least 24 seconds after the cataclysmic event that doomed it, raising the possibility that some of the passengers and crew may have been alive in the last horrifying seconds before the crippled jetliner broke apart in a fireball, investigators said. The radar information does not give a clue to whether the cockpit crew had any functioning controls to work with after the plane was disabled at 13,700 feet. [Page 1.]

VTo find the most interesting group of personalities on the Giants, a true mix of styles, cultures and athletic abilities, go immediately to the secondary. The starting strong safety, Jessie Campbell, is a quiet man who doesn't say much around the locker room but is a solid hitter and leader on the field. He calls his position coach "sir." Tito Wooten is the other safety, and at the end of last season Coach Dan Reeves told him to clean up his act. So he stopped drinking, changed agents, worked hard in the off season and now Wooten has Pro Bowl potential -- if he can control his appetite for excessive risk-taking on the field.

VNOTHING IN THIS STORY LOOKS like what it is. Trembling, but it appeared she was only shivering from the cold inside the cave, my sister emerged into the sunlight. Beginning to cry, though it seemed she was only blinking in the bright light, she asked me to please get her far away from the cave as fast as possible. I had no idea what she was talking about. What she was talking about, she stammered to my school friend and me as we grudgingly cut short our hike in the California hills above our home, was that a teen-ager in the cave she was just exploring had cornered her and forced her to stroke his penis. We saw him come out of the cave with a friend of his, both of them huge, smiling. My sister was 8, I was 9, my hiking buddy was 10. We ran.

VThe former World Boxing Council heavyweight champion OLIVER McCALL was arrested on charges of possessing crack cocaine and marijuana, his second drug-related arrest in four months. The Chicago police said yesterday they stopped McCall while he was driving his Pontiac Grand Am illegally down a lakefront bike path. The officers saw a clear plastic bag on the seat containing less than a gram of suspected crack cocaine, authorities said. An additional search turned up about 3.5 grams of marijuana, said the Cook County state's attorney's spokesman CHRIS WELCH.

VThe rap star known variously as Notorious B.I.G. and Biggie Smalls was arrested at his home last week on weapons and drug charges after a police officer inquiring about an illegally parked car smelled marijuana smoke, the authorities said. The police found an assault weapon with a defaced serial number and a small amount of marijuana and charged the singer, whose real name is Christopher G. Wallace, and James Lloyd, a rap performer with the stage name Li'l Caesar, according to Fred L. Schwanwede, an assistant prosecutor for Bergen County. Six other people at Mr. Wallace's home were charged as disorderly persons, Mr. Schwanwede said.

Ricardo Cordero Ontiveros, 35, who last November resigned as head of an intelligence unit of the National Institute to Combat Drugs, based in Tijuana, was arrested late Thursday and charged with soliciting bribes, abusing his public office as a law enforcement official and trafficking in narcotics.

VAfter more than two years of uneasy tolerance, state drug agents raided the biggest aboveboard marijuana emporium in the country here today, striking back at activists who say they are helping thousands of people seeking relief from ailments like cancer and AIDS. The authorities did not immediately shut down the operation, the Cannabis Buyers' Club of San Francisco, a five-story outlet on Market Street near City Hall. But officials said the drug agents had seized more than 40 pounds of marijuana and other evidence that would probably be used to arrest people.

VThe United States Naval Academy has recommended to the Secretary of the Navy that 15 students be expelled from the academy for possessing and using illegal drugs. The students -- 12 men and 3 women -- were among 26 midshipmen implicated last fall in what Navy officials described as the worst drug scandal in the academy's history.

VOn any sultry Acapulco night, Mexican boys move among the partying crowds on the oceanside boulevard, doing whatever they can to make a small living. For a dollar or so, the street boys will dive from a high rock into roaring surf. At busy street corners they become human flame throwers, spitting mouthfuls of lighted kerosene into arcs of fire, then passing the cup to motorists before the traffic signal turns green.

VPeace, tolerance, self-esteem, fondness for marijuana and giant thudding bass lines were the agenda of the Smokin' Grooves tour, which came to the Garden State Arts Center here on Wednesday night. The five-hour concert included hip-hop groups -- the Fugees, Cypress Hill, A Tribe Called Quest, Spearhead, Busta Rhymes and, for a few minutes, Call o' Da Wild -- and a reggae band, Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers. With rock-ribbed reggae grooves and straightforward messages, Ziggy Marley topped a dance marathon that wasn't afraid to add preaching between the beats. The show balanced good intentions and good times. Most of the lineup represents an alternative to the sexism and macho violence of best-selling hip-hop. The Fugees and A Tribe Called Quest show off verbal agility and playfulness, projecting confidence without belligerence while touching briefly on issues. Spearhead is more earnest, updating the socially conscious rhymes of Gil Scott-Heron, urging downtrodden people to ''stay strong.'' Busta Rhymes is a rap jester, a frenetic performer who can move from ferocity to comedy in an instant; he's also one of the most flamboyantly dressed performers in hip-hop. He reappeared with A Tribe Called Quest and the Fugees, each time in a different shiny costume.

VNEW YORK Giuliani Defends Budget Mayor Giuliani lashed out at critical reports from fiscal monitors on the city's $33 billion budget. The reports warned that a series of what the monitors call shortsighted measures might push the city into its worst financial trouble since it almost went bankrupt in the 1970's. $(Page 25.$) Jail Term for Ex-Car Dealer A former Long Island car dealer, John M. McNamara, who admitted bilking General Motors out of $422 million in one of the largest frauds in American corporate history, was sentenced to five years in prison. Mr. McNamara pleaded guilty in 1992 to swindling the giant automaker by borrowing billions of dollars for vans that did not exist. $(25.$) Club With Unusual Tastes A 20-year-old man claims he's part vampire, citing his unusual overbite, distaste for sunlight and occasional taste for blood. Is he a prankster? A singular freak? He appears to be neither, but rather part of a small, loosely knit demimonde of vampire enthusiasts in New York City, a scene with its own music, clubs and gustatory delectations. $(25.$) Athlete in Role of Spectator John Dagbovi Senakwami, the would-be Olympian from Togo by way of the Bronx, swam thousands of laps in the last two years in the hope of being the first of his compatriots to compete in the Summer Games. Mr. Senakwami did make it to the Games. As a spectator. About New York by David Gonzalez. $(25.$) Power to the Customers For decades, most businesses in New York City had no voice in determining who picked up their garbage, the prices charged or the length of the contracts with the carters. But now, a new city agency has given 10,000 customers the right to cancel contracts with 14 major companies immediately and to negotiate deals for lower prices with other carters. $(27.$) Standoff With Squatters A court ruling that gave New York City the go-ahead to evict squatters from city-owned buildings in the East Village led to an uneasy standoff, with some squatters fearing a violent confrontation but with City Hall saying it was in no hurry to move against them. $(27.$) 2 Are Raped at Harlem Pool A young woman and a teen-age girl who went swimming after hours in a public pool in Harlem with two male companions were raped at gunpoint by two robbers, the police said. The four were at the pool in Marcus Garvey Park at East 124th Street and Fifth Avenue when the rapes and robbery occurred, the police said. Charged in Safety Violations A propane gas company whose driver was killed in a fiery crash in White Plains two years ago was charged with violating Federal safety regulations that limit the number of hours drivers can work without time off. The company, Suburban Paraco Corporation, is accused of indicating that truckers were off duty when in fact they were driving. $(28.$) Marijuana Question Lingers As Representative Susan Molinari spent the day in San Diego, preparing for her speech at the Republican National Convention, she was nagged by the conflicting responses she has given on whether or not she used marijuana 20 years ago. $(28.$) REGION Inquiry on 'Charity' in Crash The authorities are investigating a group that says it is soliciting money for the families of the victims of Flight 800. The group, Families of National Tragedies, has no connection to T.W.A. or to the relatives of the 230 people killed in the July 17 crash. It was not incorporated until 12 days after the explosion, and its of ficers are two men who have no experience running a charity. $(26.$) Federal investigators looking for the cause of the destruction of T.W.A. Flight 800 said they expected no quick answers. $(26.$) NEW JERSEY Court Faults Race-Based Layoff A Federal appeals court declared that a school district should not have used race as the primary reason to dismiss a white teacher. The Board of Education of Piscataway cited its affirmative action policy of a diverse workplace when deciding in 1989 between laying off a black or a white teacher. The court found the policy to be unlawful because it was not put into place to remedy past discrimination and because it unnecessarily violated the rights of a nonminority employee. $(1.$) CONNECTICUT Integration Panel Scrutinized A state panel charged with finding ways to integrate Hartford's schools with those of its suburban neighbors does not have enough minority members or Hartford residents, the plaintiffs in a landmark desegregation suit said. Of the 20 panel members appointed so far, two are Hispanic and four are black, one of them the group's sole Hartford resident. $(28.$)

VI teach an experimental course called ''American Odyssey'' in which college students spend a semester reading classic works while traveling around the country to visit historical sites and meet writers. The curriculum includes 50 books, ranging from ''Leaves of Grass'' to ''The Color Purple'' to ''On the Road.'' Recently, I've added a new title: ''America Day by Day,'' a forgotten gem by Simone de Beauvoir, long out of print. Beauvoir journeyed to America in January 1947, armed with an effusive letter of introduction from her soul mate Jean-Paul Sartre, ecstatic about experiencing the sweeping vistas of more than 20 states in four whirlwind months. Although she did not intend to write a book, she kept a detailed diary of her observations, which was published in France in 1948 as ''L'Amerique au Jour le Jour.'' At the time of her trip, two years before publication of ''The Second Sex,'' Beauvoir was considered more of a cafe society curiosity than a feminist trailblazer. Even in 1952, when the book was translated and published in England as ''America Day by Day,'' it generated few sales and little notice. But with the passage of time ''America Day by Day'' emerges as a supremely erudite American road book -- that distinctive subgenre based on flights of fancy rather than flights from economic hardship, as in John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath.''

VJust before giving away his only daughter, Susan Molinari, at her first wedding, in 1988, Guy Molinari stopped on his way down the aisle to shake hands with Bob Dole. But if the bride was thinking, ''Where is Miss Manners when you need her?'' she did not let on. As a third-generation politician in a family that has always married the personal and the political, Ms. Molinari has lately followed suit: she and her second husband, Bill Paxon, a fellow Congressional Republican, began a whirlwind extended honeymoon-campaign tour on behalf of their party soon after their marriage in 1994. Their daughter, 3-month-old Susan Ruby Paxon, has already become a fixture in television interviews with Ms. Molinari.

VSOME neuroscientists are experiencing what amounts to a natural high. For the first time, they have captured images of the brains of addicts in the throes of craving for a drug, revealing the neural basis for addiction. The finding caps a decade or more of intensive brain research seeking the grail of substance abuse, the neurological circuitry that compels addicts to pursue the next fix. And the discovery confirms a number of emerging scientific hunches about the neurology of addiction.

While the mainstream networks were interviewing the usual Republican suspects, who gushed about how the 61-year-old Jack Kemp had brought youth and energy to the campaign, MTV carried a live concert by the band 311 on Tuesday afternoon, linked to the channel's political coverage. (Mr. Kemp was nowhere near the mosh pit.)

The melons are swollen and the olives are getting plump. But all this pales compared with the activity in the fields where marijuana plants have risen as tall as humans. On the humid slopes and the steep terraces great contingents of men, women and children are getting ready for the harvest.

VGLOBAL HABIT The Drug Problem in a Borderless World. By Paul B. Stares. 171 pp. Washington: Brookings Institution. $24.95. SMOKE AND MIRRORS The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure. By Dan Baum. 396 pp. Boston: Little, Brown & Company. $24.95. DRUG WAR POLITICS The Price of Denial. By Eva Bertram, Morris Blachman, Kenneth Sharpe and Peter Andreas. 347 pp. Berkeley: University of California Press. Cloth, $48. Paper, $17.95. After nearly three decades and hundreds of billions of dollars, almost no one seems content with the war against illegal drugs. Prohibitionists keep blaming people overseas for America's addiction. Others propose legalizing drugs without explaining how legalization would work. Meanwhile, drug use among adolescents climbs, prisons overflow with dealers and users, and Congress cuts funds to treat the addicted. Americans look in vain to their leaders, who keep dodging the issue, especially in an election year. Now three new books suggest that most people who write about the subject aren't doing much better.

VEvery day dozens of heroin addicts come into the office of Alex Meikle, a sociologist who has worked for six years in Possil, a low-income Glasgow neighborhood, which he calls ''the heroin shooting gallery of the world.'' They seek methadone treatment to get off heroin and help with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, or hepatitis C infections. And they tell heartbreaking stories of addictions that began when they were as young as 11, living in families where brothers, sisters and sometimes parents took drugs.

VInternational A3-11 INDIA VETOES NUCLEAR TEST BAN India formally vetoed the international nuclear test ban treaty, and officials feared that the setback would interrupt progress in containing the nuclear threat and weaken disarmament efforts. A1 CONFUSION RULES IN RUSSIA Confusion over a supposed presidential order to intensify the Chechen war, which is contrary to the position that had been taken by President Boris Yeltsin, raised doubt over who is in charge. A1 TRADE GAP WITH CHINA UP China surpassed Japan in June as the largest source of the American trade deficit, which could further strain relations with Beijing. The deficit with China -- $3.3 billion -- came as the United States' overall trade gap shrank to $8.1 billion from $10.5 billion in May. A1 SEEKING REASON FOR JORDAN RIOTS Jordan, considered a paragon of stability, sought the reasons for food riots, and most people pointed to the frustrations of the poor over the lack of tangible improvements in their lives. A3 INDONESIA ARMS SALE DEBATED The United States has agreed to sell fighter jets to Indonesia, but its recent crackdown on dissent is causing second thoughts, with debate developing about whether to go ahead with the sale. A7 SOME RENEWAL IN LIBERIA CITY The Liberian capital, Monrovia, is starting to recover from the fighting there, but the nearly seven years of civil war in the country have left the people's spirits as scarred as the buildings. A8 DEEPENING RIFT IN CAMBODIA The debate in Cambodia over whether to reconcile with a breakaway leader of the Khmer Rouge has pointed up the deepening rift in the Government, whose very structure encourages instability. A9 In Kiev, a new day, but Soviet-era hotels still prevail. A10 In South Africa, debate over vigilantes against drugs. A4 Johannesburg Journal: Disorder as a city evolves. A4 National A12-15, B6 DOLE SPEAKS TO VETERANS Bob Dole spoke to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, assailing President Clinton as weak on the military and pledging that veterans would not be hurt by his own tax plan. A1 AN UNUSUAL ALLIANCE The New Alliance Party, a flamboyant fixture on the margins of national and local politics for years, has decided to back Ross Perot. A1 Ross Perot's statistics are generally accurate, if not relevant. A14 Eugene McCarthy vividly remembers the 1968 convention. A15 The Dole campaign began broadcasting a new commercial. A15 In speeches, Jack Kemp is never far from the football field. A15 SECOND WHITEWATER SENTENCE Susan McDougal, a defendant in the Whitewater case and a former partner of the Clintons, was sentenced to two years in prison. A1 FOOTBALL TEAM HEADS BACK After more than 20 years in the suburbs, the Detroit Lions football team announced plans to move back into its namesake city. A12 TEEN-AGE DRUG USE CLIMBS Federal officials said that marijuana smoking among teen-agers more than doubled from 1992 to 1995 and that overall teen-age drug use rose by at least 78 percent. A12 LIE-DETECTOR TEST IN BOMB CASE Lawyers for Richard Jewell released the results of a lie-detector test in which a polygraph examiner said Mr. Jewell had had no role in the Olympic bombing. A13 MINIMUM-WAGE BILL SIGNED President Clinton signed legislation to raise the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour over the next year, the first increase in five years.

VAdmitting they had not pushed hard enough for drug-abuse prevention programs, Federal officials disclosed yesterday that marijuana smoking among American teen-agers had jumped 141 percent from 1992 to 1995 and that overall teen-age drug use more than doubled. The figures were immediately pounced on as campaign ammunition by Republicans: The Presidential nominee, Bob Dole, called them ''nothing short of a national tragedy,'' and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah decried ''an upward spiral of drug abuse across the nation since President Clinton took office.''

Mr. Mata and his brother, Alonzo, were convicted of first-degree murder and were sentenced to die for the fatal stabbing of Debra Lee Lopez of Phoenix. They were resentenced later under changes in Arizona's death penalty law, with Luis Mata getting a death sentence but Alonzo Mata receiving a life term because of mitigating circumstances, including his age at the time, 18.

VDrug use among teen-agers, once on the wane, is again rising sharply. A Federal report issued this week found that the percentage of adolescents currently using drugs more than doubled in four years, from a low of 5.3 percent in 1992 to 10.9 percent in 1995. That is still well below the high levels of the 1970's, when usage rates topped 16 percent, but the trend line is worrisome. More vigorous efforts by Federal, state and local governments are clearly needed to turn the rates back down. Unfortunately, the issue was immediately politicized in a way that clouded rational discussion. Republicans blamed the increases on a failure of leadership by President Clinton and an allegedly permissive attitude toward drugs in the White House.

VClinton Administration officials disclosed that American teen-agers' use of illegal drugs -- mainly marijuana -- had more than doubled between 1992 and 1995. The survey, released by the Department of Health and Human Services, found that 10.9 percent of the 12- to 17-year-olds surveyed had used drugs in the month before the survey. That figure is below the peak of the late 1970's, but up from the 10-year low in 1992.

VFoxfire Hedy Burress, Angelina Jolie, Jenny Lewis, Jenny Shimizu, Sarah Rosenberg Directed by Annette Haywood-Carter R 102 minutes Four high school girls have nothing in common except biology class. But soon after each one learns that she is not the only one being fondled by the teacher, a mysterious stranger named Legs (Ms. Jolie) drifts into town and starts forging bonds between the girls by showing them how to take responsibility for their lives. They then become a tightknit group with a completely different -- and no longer demure -- outlook on life. VIOLENCE Quite a lot of violence but not much bloodshed: the girls fight their teacher, break into the school and start a fire, threaten someone at knifepoint and steal his car after an attempted rape, and kidnap and shoot the father of one of them. SEX There is much adolescent talk about sexual experience (and lack thereof). Beyond the talk, the teacher's groping, a boy's bare buttocks and the girls' bared breasts are shown, the latter as Legs seductively applies tattoos. PROFANITY The girl's mouths match their actions. FOOTNOTE Goldie (Ms. Shimuzu) is shown smoking a lot of marijuana, injecting herself with heroin and enduring heroin withdrawal. For Which Children? AGES 14 and up: The messages of bonding and empowerment will certainly appeal to a lot of girls. And young audiences may enjoy the crime spree, though boys may find much to hoot at. SUZANNE O'CONNOR

VAfter gunmen burst into the home of a prominent lawyer and shot him to death last year, a detective charged five colleagues in the Guerrero State Judicial Police with the killing. Once in jail, several of the officers accused a powerful politician from Mexico's governing party of organizing the crime. And behind the killing, the detective uncovered a tale of passion and betrayal: the slain lawyer, during a decade of child-support litigation, had represented a woman who said the politician had been her lover and the father of her daughter.

VUsing an assortment of old and new tactics to eliminate the drug trade in high-crime neighborhoods, the New York City Police Department is seeing the first fruits of an ambitious drug crackdown that goes beyond the arrests of low-level dealers and targets the entire networks that supply them. The crackdown is predicated on the belief that drug trafficking drives violent crime in the city and that dismantling neighborhood drug organizations will accelerate the already-sharp declines in crime.

VThere's a lot to be said for the way justice is done here in Otsego County, a lush but sparsely populated rural area that's just a four-hour drive from New York City but a million miles away from its courts. The handful of lawyers and judges have known each other for years, so disputes are often resolved with a minimum of rancor, a modicum of humor and a maximum of gossip. City folk, accustomed to the anonymity of mass-produced justice, might be charmed by the niceties of handshake-lawyering. But practicing law in a small rural community entails hazards never dreamed of by, say, the Manhattan District Attorney. Jack Gibbons, the Otsego County District Attorney, ran smack into them, and a result was that this August, the biggest case of his career was taken away from him.

VA national tragedy,'' declared Bob Dole last week. A sign of ''moral weakness,'' added William Bennett, the former drug czar who has said he wants his old job back. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, lamented a lack of ''strong Presidential leadership.'' The subject of all this Republican hand-wringing was the release of the Government's latest National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. The survey, an annual poll of more than 17,000 Americans over the age of 12, showed that adolescent drug use roughly doubled from 1992 to 1995.

VBob Dole and several California officials today attributed the recent rise in drug use among young people to what they called President Clinton's failure of moral leadership and by extension, his failure of character. ''When we talk about drug abuse, we're talking about fundamental issues of character,'' Michael D. Bradbury, the district attorney of Ventura County, said as he introduced Mr. Dole at an antidrug rally here as ''a man of unquestioned integrity, a man of unquestioned character, a man who will reclaim the moral high ground for the Presidency.''

VSAVE for a few white lilies sprouting from gaudy plastic flower arrangements near the stage, there is little evidence that the New York Christian Life Center in East New York, Brooklyn, is a church. There is hardly any Christian iconography. The setting is like a television studio, with a band near the stage playing snappy interludes, contemporary gospel selections that the pastor calls ''positive message music.'' ''Are you blessed?'' a church elder queried the congregants on a recent Sunday.

VIt was only a matter of time until it happened, and just a few minutes before midnight Friday, it finally did. After a round of rip-snorting speeches and fireworks under a nearly full moon along the Ohio riverfront in Paducah, Ky., the Willie Nelson tape blared out. ''On the road again, I just can't wait to get on the road again,'' the braided bard of Nashville sang as the President of the United States shook hands. And Bill Clinton's every act seemed an endorsement of the spirit of the song.

VBob Dole campaigned before two distinctly different audiences here today, telling the National Guard that he would enlist them in the war against drugs and telling members of B'nai B'rith that he was intolerant of discrimination, which he said he understood because of his physical disability. The reactions of the two crowds to the Republican Presidential nominee could not have been more disparate. The tens of thousands of members of the National Guard, many wearing their dark green uniforms, cheered and applauded mightily at Mr. Dole's recognition of their service and their abilities.

VEvil temper is everywhere. It doubtless has to do with the political campaign. Presidential campaigns often bring out the worst in people, and not just in politicians, but in your relatives, friends, associates and complete strangers. The worst nationwide case of political evil temper I recall occurred in the 1964 campaign between Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater. Newspapers that year published letters to editors containing abuse that would make even a modern talk-radio host cringe.

VSHE started taking drugs when she was 15. First it was marijuana, then she moved on to pills and cocaine. She dropped out of high school but she always worked, most often as a waitress. The woman, who lives in Fairfield County, married and divorced and got into a new relationship. When that relationship ended, nothing would take the edge off the pain she was feeling -- not the pills, nothing. So she started to take heroin. Someone she knew took it and had told her she'd feel better using it. ''It sedated me. I felt no more pain,'' she said.

VTeen-agers whose baby-boom parents smoked marijuana regularly a generation ago are more likely to use drugs than other teen-agers, a national study released today has found. The study, commissioned by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, found that 58 percent of parents who once smoked marijuana regularly would consider it a ''crisis'' if their young teen-ager used the drug, compared with 83 percent of parents who never tried marijuana. The study says that teen-agers are more ''at risk'' of using drugs in general if their parents think that marijuana is relatively harmless.

VG.M. Presents Offer In Labor Negotiations General Motors made its first comprehensive contract offer to the United Automobile Workers union, as national labor contract negotiations continued at all three Detroit auto makers. G.M. officials did not release details of their offer. But by making a specific proposal now, G.M. is able to stake out its position before the U.A.W. reaches a deal with Ford, which the union has chosen as its negotiating target to set a pattern for the industry. $(Page D2.$) Productivity Rose in 2d Quarter Companies operated more cheaply and efficiently during the second quarter than first reported, largely because wage costs were not rising as rapidly as estimated. A revised report showed that productivity actually rose, instead of falling slightly. $(D2.$) Demand Grows For Chips Demand for computer chips rose slightly last month, but was still down from last year. The Semiconductor Industry Association's book-to-bill ratio, which measures new orders against shipments, rose to 0.90 in August from a revised 0.86 in July. $(D4.$) 2 Energy Companies in Venture The Coastal Corporation and Westcoast Energy said they would combine their natural gas and electricity marketing operations, joining the industry trend toward consolidation. $(D2.$) Reagan Aide Criticizes Tax-Cut Plan Murray L. Weidenbaum, a major architect and defender of Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts, broke ranks with Republicans and warned against the reductions proposed by Bob Dole, their Presidential nominee. $(D2.$) Bonds Fall on Fed Officials' Words The prices of Treasury securities sagged after comments by Federal Reserve officials led to heightened anxiety over the likelihood of the Fed's increasing interest rates. The yield of the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 7.11 percent from 7.07. $(D16.$) The dollar hit its highest levels in nearly two months against the German mark and the Japanese yen, rising on continued expectations of increased American interest rates. $(D13.$) Stocks were mixed. The Dow industrials fell, 6.66 points, to 5,727.18, but broader indexes were mostly higher. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.72 point, to 1,149.43. $(D6.$) Village Voice Editor Resigns Karen Durbin, the editor of The Village Voice, said she was resigning over differences with the weekly newspaper's publisher. Neither Ms. Durbin nor the publisher, David Schneiderman, would explain their differences. $(B3.$) Out of the Fire, Into the Frying Pan A growing number of people are trading the corporate world for the kitchen, seeking creative fulfillment, satisfaction in their work, greater mobility and, if they start their own businesses, control over their lives. Though these people may make considerable financial sacrifices, jobs are plentiful.

VAcross the country, the scattered dissidents who denounce the whole idea of a war on drugs have found an unexpected ally: George Soros, the currency-market Croesus who is known for donating hundreds of millions of dollars each year to shore up democracy in the former Soviet bloc. In his most recent contribution out of the nearly $15 million he has given or pledged to change drug policy, Mr. Soros has made major personal donations to two ground-breaking state ballot initiatives that would legalize the medical use of marijuana: $350,000 to one in California and $100,000 to one in Arizona.

''We've had a barrage, we've had an assault, we've had a flood of negative ads,'' Mr. Dole said in Kentucky. ''Have you seen one positive ad about Bill Clinton? ''They're all negative ads bashing Bob Dole, bashing Jack Kemp, saying we're going to cut Medicare, we're going to cut Social Security, we're going to cut student loans, we're going to cut veterans -- we don't have a friend in the world!''

VTeen-agers whose parents once puffed marijuana regularly are more likely to use it than other teen-agers, a new study found. The study, released by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, reached the conclusion after polling parents and teen-agers: Parents who had frequently used marijuana were less alarmed than others by the prospect that their children might try it. Given that ambivalence, their children were more likely to experiment than others.

VGeorge Soros, the currency-market mogul who has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to the former Soviet bloc, is contributing a tiny portion of his fortune closer to home in an effort to broaden the American debate on what to do about drugs. Mr. Soros's foundations have given about $15 million since 1994 to groups studying the issue. This election season he has also offered two personal donations in support of ballot initiatives in California and Arizona that would legalize the medical use of marijuana. But the gifts may not thrill the Clinton Administration, whose drug policy director, Barry McCaffrey, denounced the California initiative last week as ''dangerous and wrong.'' CAREY GOLDBERG

VMark Ebenhoch has on his ''command'' voice: the voice of fearless authority he learned during 12 years in the Marines. A fearless voice hardly seems appropriate now, in my hotel room, talking about sex; he wants to get rid of it, but it keeps re-emerging. If he had the money, he'd also like to get rid of the tattoos: the one on his left arm that reads ''U.S.M.C. and damn proud'' and the one on his chest, the so-called meat patch, with his Social Security number and blood type: B-positive. Which could be his catch phrase. Be positive. So he talks about what has brought him to this state -- he is H.I.V.-negative but wonders how long he can hold on -- as if he were announcing a baseball game. ''Heck, I'd been such a good boy, followed my church upbringing, wouldn't cuss, even in the corps. I was celibate for 13 years instead of being gay! So then, last year when I finally came out, I came out flying like a bat out of hell. Wednesday, Friday, Saturday I'd go to this bar called Friends, which was outside a military base that was notorious for gay bashings. I'd walk in and it was a really friendly atmosphere, so I sat down and ordered a beer. Once, this guy, not even my type really, sat down next to me. He was military, which I could tell from his haircut, and it didn't take that long, a drink or two and a couple cigarettes, before he said, 'Do you want to go do something?' And it was like, O.K., let's go.

VShortly after he took office in 1993, President Clinton gutted the drug policy staff that he inherited from President George Bush, cutting it to 25 employees from 146, to fulfill his campaign pledge to run a smaller White House. The cut, in the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, has come back to haunt Mr. Clinton in the past few weeks. Bob Dole cites the 80 percent reduction to tell voters that four more years of Mr. Clinton would bring ''staggering'' new increases in illegal drug use among their children. In a Dole Administration, he promised, ''I will insure that they have enough staff and funding to get the job done.''

VDrug policy has laid claim to center stage in '96 Presidential campaign with recriminations by both sides giving issue more exposure than it has had in half dozen years, even though experts doubt any Presidential action would have much influence, especially on behavior of juvenile drug users; Republican nominee Bob Dole has accused Pres Clinton of not providing more leadership to stop drug use, while failing to note that while he was Senate majority leader, Republican-controlled Congress cut appropriations for drug prevention and treatment in Clinton budget; Clinton, who initially kept low profile on drug issue, even as use of illegal drugs by adolescents doubled during his tenure, has become more active on issue in seeking re-election; under Administration, part of Federal budget devoted to fighting drugs has risen from less than $13.3 billion in '95 fiscal year to nearly $13.8 billion in '96 and record $15.3 billion for '97; graphs (M)

VAs drug use among teen-agers begins to rise sharply after years of decline, experts in drug abuse say there is an opportunity to halt the incipient epidemic in its tracks. But they disagree on the right remedy. The most popular anti-drug program is DARE, for Drug Abuse Resistance Education, which is used in nearly 75 percent of the nation's school systems. But several leading academic experts, supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, say that the program does not work and that other programs that have been effective are not being used. Its supporters, on the other hand, note the widespread acceptance of their program. And few if any schools have adopted the programs favored by the academic experts.

VTeachers, principals and school safety aides in New York City said yesterday that they would continue to search students aggressively for guns and other weapons, despite a state appeals court ruling this week that a 15-year-old student caught with a loaded gun should not have been suspended because he was searched illegally. ''I'd rather for us to do that job and have the court make the decision that it was not proper than have him in a classroom with a loaded gun,'' said Carl E. Haines, president of Teamsters Local 237, which represents the system's 3,500 school security guards.

But he said the degree of improvement was not entirely clear because of changes in the way the Board of Education collected such statistics. While reports of less serious offenses like harassment and disorderly conduct rose nearly 50 percent as compared to the previous school year, reports of assault fell 43 percent, robberies 7 percent and weapons possessions 2 percent, Dr. Crew said.

VBob Dole today denounced what he termed the glorification of heroin and other drugs by the entertainment industry and led a high school gym filled with teen-agers in chanting a new slogan that he presented as the center of his drug-fighting strategy: ''Just don't do it.'' Mr. Dole said President Clinton shared responsibility with the entertainment industry for the surge in drug use by teen-agers. He said the President displayed ''moral confusion'' for having joked, in an interview on MTV that has been incorporated into Mr. Dole's television advertisements, about his youthful experimentation with marijuana.

VThis is a 30-second television commercial called ''School,'' released yesterday by the Dole/Kemp campaign committee. It will be broadcast today. PRODUCER Alex Castellanos ON THE SCREEN The advertisement opens with a grainy, black-and-white shot of children in a school yard. The schoolchildren are seen inspecting a plastic bag filled with what appears to be marijuana, then passing around a marijuana cigarette. It then shows a youngster drawing on a glass pipe. A graphic superimposed notes: ''Clinton cut office of National Drug Control Policy 83 percent.'' The scene then switches to President Clinton answering a question in a 1992 interview with MTV, about his own drug use. The film ends by freezing on Mr. Clinton, looking sheepish, after he says he would inhale if given an opportunity. The words superimposed are: ''Clinton's liberal drug policy has failed.'' SCRIPT The producers, once again, use a woman to narrate the script, a common device for hard-hitting commercials. ''We send them off to school. And we worry. Teen-age drug use has doubled since 1992. And Bill Clinton? He cut the White House drug office 83 percent. His own Surgeon General considered legalizing drugs. And in front of our children, on MTV, the President himself.'' The scene switches to an audience member: ''If you had it to do over again, would you inhale?'' Mr. Clinton: ''Sure, if I could. I tried before.'' The announcer ends by saying: ''Bill Clinton doesn't get it. But we do.'' ACCURACY The advertisement is basically accurate. But it does not note that Mr. Clinton, after cutting back the White House drug czar's office, restored the financing. Nor does it say that Mr. Dole voted against creating the drug czar's office. Clinton aides complained that Mr. Dole had taken a statement Mr. Clinton made before he was President and used it to unfairly represent his record in office. SCORECARD This advertisement, which has been expected for a week, is the most direct attempt by Mr. Dole in his television advertisements to raise questions about Mr. Clinton's character. It reminds voters that Mr. Clinton smoked marijuana and suggests that by almost joking about it, he shares some of the responsibility for the upsurge in drug use. On a less obvious level, it is intended to reinforce a theme of the Dole campaign that Mr. Clinton is liberal, and thus out-of-touch with the electorate. As a hard-hitting advertisement, it comes with some risk. However, Mr. Dole began laying the groundwork for it last week by complaining (correctly) that he had been the target of attack advertisements from the Clinton campaign. ADAM NAGOURNEY

VThe President We Deserve Bill Clinton: His Rise, Falls, and Comebacks. By Martin Walker. Illustrated. 360 pp. New York: Crown Publishers. $27.50. Over the past four years publishing contentious books about Bill Clinton -- most of them highly unfavorable -- has become something of a cottage industry. Although a few, such as David Maraniss's excellent biography, ''First in His Class,'' Ernest Dumas's illuminating study, ''The Clintons of Arkansas,'' and Elizabeth Drew's two indispensable analyses, ''On the Edge'' and ''Showdown,'' have been fair minded, the bulk read either as tabloid partisan potshots or as investigative tracts on Whitewater. As Leslie H. Gelb put it in a column in The New York Times, ''My colleagues and I, like journalistic Dr. Strangeloves, are ready to nuke Mr. Clinton at the slightest provocation.''

VProbably no European capital is as compact and intimate, as friendly to pedestrians and hostile to cars as Amsterdam. So our day will be entirely on foot. Never mind the marijuana culture and the beckoning of the city's lazy cannabis cafes. This itinerary will begin at the medieval core, the place where Amsterdam was born. The Dam Square is exactly that: the site where the River Amstel was dammed in the 13th century, giving the city its name and its permanently unruly heart. Here is the great Renaissance town hall, proof of the wealth of the 17th-century merchants (it later became a royal palace), and next door are the Gothic arches of the 15th-century New Church. It is remarkable that all this stony weight rests on thousands of wooden piles pegged into the unsteady sandy soil.

VAfter dwelling for weeks on the economy, Bob Dole has begun attacking President Clinton on drugs and crime. As a tactical matter, Republicans may be right to try to add to Mr. Dole's central proposal, a 15 percent tax cut that has failed to excite voters. Mr. Clinton, however, has moved shrewdly to pre-empt criticism on these two social issues no less than everywhere else. The Republican candidate's poor gun-control record makes it unlikely that he can reclaim the crime issue for his own. As for drugs, both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole are right to call for more leadership, and right to accuse each other of ignoring the problem until fairly recently. A debate about two such emotional issues is certainly welcome. Crime has been generally on the decline, especially in many big cities, but there is much that can still be done to help local police departments combat crime and curb the use of guns. The rise in drug use among American teen-agers over the last few years is also a cause for concern. Drugs are less prevalent than they were in the 1980's, and substantially less than in the 1970's, but a national survey showed recently that 10.9 percent of teen-agers used drugs at least monthly in 1995, up from 5.3 percent in 1992.

VAlex Kelly, a former high school wrestling star who fled to Europe a decade ago after being accused of raping two girls, faced new charges yesterday, three days after a car crash near his parents' fashionable home in Darien, Conn. The Darien police said Mr. Kelly was driving the white Nissan that zoomed past a radar post on Friday evening, speeded up even more when officers pursued it and then flipped over, injuring a young woman who was hurled onto the pavement. Officers said they saw a young man fleeing the scene through the woods.

VOnce again, the Republicans have lured television networks into broadcasting one of their political advertisements nationally for a pittance. Over the weekend, the Dole campaign released an updated version of a commercial attacking President Clinton on drugs. The campaign has paid for the commercial to appear only on cable television in the District of Columbia, whose electoral votes Mr. Dole has otherwise displayed little interest in pursuing. But the advertisement received national play when ABC and CNN broadcast pieces of it on their news programs.

VThe people of Etowah County, explains the Rev. Aaron Johnson, the preacher at the First Baptist Church of Gadsden, are a little bit different. In their distinctly Southern way, they are a tad mistrustful, a bit suspicious. Even in the best of times, it seems, they fear that distant forces may be conspiring to take their jobs and undermine their values. Maybe, Mr. Johnson suggests, it is all the talk out of Washington about gun control and gay marriages. Maybe it is because even in the best of times, the economy of this blue-collar city of 45,000 people in northeastern Alabama never quite feels secure.

VThe Supreme Court today agreed to hear a constitutional challenge to a Georgia law that requires candidates for many state offices, including those of governor, state legislator and justice of the State Supreme Court, to pass a drug test as a condition of appearing on the ballot. The challenge to the six-year-old law, apparently the only law of its kind in the country, was brought by a lawyer who wanted to run for lieutenant governor on the Libertarian Party ticket but who viewed the required drug test as an invasion of both his privacy and his right to free speech.

The tension level pumped up quickly among the dozens of state and city police officers clustered at the bottom of the northbound off-ramp at Exit 29 of the Connecticut Turnpike. They were there to stamp down the drug trade believed to be behind a sudden rash of murders that has stunned this faded industrial city.

''Am I just experiencing blues that will pass?'' is the question posed by Dr. Sheila A. Cooperman, a staff psychiatrist at Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan. It will be answered at a free screening on Thursday in a local church. ''The good news,'' Dr. Cooperman said, ''is that research and case histories reveal 60 to 70 percent do recover using a combination of treatments.''

VWHAT'S surprising is not so much that this conservative law-and-order state seems to have legalized the sale of marijuana, but that it took even the most ardent of the state's pot smokers nearly a decade to figure it out. ''When I first read the law I thought, O.K., I see this, but I didn't think you could really do it,'' Bill Green, an aerospace engineer, said while sharing a joint with several other marijuana enthusiasts in front of the copper-domed state Capitol on a recent afternoon. ''I never had any idea I could buy a license and be a law-abiding citizen while I burned a joint. But I pay my marijuana tax now. I'm as legal as you get.''

CLINTON Thank you, Jim. And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts. I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service, and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.

VThe documentary form, in its infinite variety and sometimes troubling methodology, gets two vigorous workouts this evening with ''Raw Footage'' on the Independent Film Channel (to be repeated on Friday on Bravo) and ''Smashed'' on MTV. ''Raw Footage'' is the first installment in a new monthly series, with Alec Baldwin as host, that aims to examine the politics of independent film making, the kinds of projects that dig beneath the slickness of standard commercial fare.

VBob Dole entered Sunday's Presidential debate with two political handicaps. He emerged with three. The first handicap was President Clinton. He achieved so large an October lead in the polls the way his critics thought he never could: by convincing enough Americans that he had looked after their economic and social interests and would continue to do exactly that in a second term.

VAfter a steep decline throughout the 1980's, marijuana use among the state's high school students rose sharply from 1992 to 1995, officials said yesterday. The latest three-year survey of students in grades 10 to 12 found that 42.1 percent of them admitted having tried the drug at least once, up from 27 percent for the previous three years, said Roger Shatzkin, a spokesman for the State Attorney General's office. In addition, 4.7 percent said they had used heroin, up from 1.6 percent in 1989.

VNicole, a high school junior with short brown hair, soft eyes and a delicate chin, has smoked marijuana since she was 13 years old. Many of her friends at her Massachusetts high school use it too, and sometimes her father joins her. ''I smoke weed with my dad,'' Nicole, who is now 16, said. ''Obviously he feels fine about it. Since I started smoking weed, we've gotten closer.'' Marijuana has become so routine that Nicole admitted, ''I smoke every single day.''

VNEW YORK For Landlords, Troubles Grow Tens of thousands of poor tenants spend half or more of their small incomes for shelter that is substandard, dangerous or illegal. And many landlords find it increasingly difficult to provide decent homes and still make a profit. These are the root problems of housing the city's very poor: they can't pay much, and doing business in New York costs a lot. $(Page A1.$) Big Drop in Child-Abuse Deaths Despite a rash of highly publicized child-abuse cases, the number of children dying at the hands of their parents has declined sharply in New York City and State in the last five years, and government officials and child welfare experts are at a loss to explain why. $(B1.$) Giuliani Steps Up Cable Clash The Giuliani administration intensified its confrontation with Time Warner, announcing that because the company's cable system refused to carry Rupert Murdoch's 24-hour Fox News Channel, the city would put it on a municipal cable station. $(B1.$) The Fox News Channel offers 24 hours of reports, features, interviews, analysis, promos and commercials. If that sounds a lot like what CNN and MSNBC offer, well, sure. Television review. $(B3.$) Co-op's Solidarity Challenged Forty-six years ago, Co-op Village, a complex of union-financed co-ops on the Lower East Side, was a workingman's dream come true.

VTwo months after raiding and shutting down the nation's largest distributor of medicinal marijuana, state drug agents arrested its founder this morning and issued arrest warrants for five others involved with the operation of the market, the Cannabis Buyers' Club of San Francisco. Dennis Peron, head of the club and a longtime advocate of the legalization of marijuana, was arrested at his home by state drug agents. He was indicted by an Alameda County grand jury on charges of criminal conspiracy, possession of marijuana for sale and transportation of marijuana, Attorney General Dan Lungren said today.

VThe girl in the electric blue boa was back. So was the pounding techno music and the huge disco balls spraying the dance floor with a kaleidoscope of whirling dots. But loyal patrons who returned to the Tunnel last night said the reopened nightclub was not the same. The reopening on Friday came a month after the club was shut down under the city's nuisance abatement law when the police said they saw evidence of drug sales there. Its owner, Peter Gatien, awaits trial after being charged in a separate, Federal drug case earlier this year involving his clubs. But he was allowed to reopen the Tunnel if he paid fines and adhered to strict new safeguards.

VWHEN I asked Dr. Andrew Weil what to do for hay fever, the plant-loving shaman with the Harvard medical degree suggested eating stinging nettles instead of taking antihistamines, which he said only suppress symptoms and can be toxic. Stinging nettles, scruffy weeds that are sort of the jellyfish of cow pastures, are packed with iron and trace minerals. Picked wild in the spring and steamed, they lose their sting and are as tasty as dandelion greens. You can also buy stinging nettles as a freeze-dried extract in capsules and take two every two to four hours as needed.

VTo the Editor: I thought I'd grown numb to the kind of ill-founded logic that would declare, based on interviews with just 30 students from New York and Massachusetts, that ''marijuana use among the young appears to be increasing, perhaps at an even higher rate than the Government report and others suggest'' (news article, Oct. 10). You did not indicate how or why these youths were selected. The inclusion of two teen-agers' comments about President Clinton's drug use serves to impugn his credibility on drug prevention and insinuate that his personal use of marijuana two decades ago is a cause of recent increases in youth drug use. That youth drug use is more political football than policy debate during election season is unsurprising, if unfortunate. MATTHEW O. HOWARD Portland, Ore., Oct. 16, 1996 The writer is a research associate professor, department of psychiatry, Oregon Health Sciences University.

VPresident Clinton said today that teen-agers should be required to pass a drug test before receiving driver's licenses, and he instructed Administration officials to report to him in 90 days with a plan, including possible legislation, to make such a practice standard around the country. Mr. Clinton made the proposal in his weekly Saturday radio address, in which he also announced that the Administration would issue a final rule on Monday putting into effect a law passed by Congress last year intended to stop drunken driving by young people.

VThe contenders have been uninspiring, the ''debates'' dreary, the intellectual level ranged from vapid to embarrassing -- but the Presidential campaign has brought one important benefit to the country. It moved President and contender at last to give consistent public attention to a national problem that hugely increases crime, ruins family lives, sickens the brain, drives many Americans out of work forever, afflicts millions with diseases that cost taxpayers billions, makes the U.S. weaker physically, poorer economically, ugly culturally, withered morally and an object of contempt internationally: drug abuse.

VKathleen Chang was an eccentric to some and a valiant voice for social justice to others, but she was hard to ignore: in the summer, she wore a bikini to her protests, in the winter, leotards. Sometimes it was a suit of faux marijuana to grab attention for the one-woman political demonstrations she staged for 15 years on the University of Pennsylvania campus. On Tuesday, feeling that her cause for social ''transformation'' was not getting through, Ms. Chang, 46, held her final protest. At 11:20 A.M., as students walked across campus or sat on the green, she stood before a sculpture of a peace sign, poured a bucket of gasoline over her thin frame and set herself afire. She was pronounced dead shortly afterward.

VWith state legislators increasingly trying to avoid voting on issues like taxes, term limits, campaign finance and tort reform, voters in 20 states will decide 90 citizens' initiatives on Election Day, making 1996 a possible banner year for this form of end-run governance, particularly in California and much of the rest of the West. Not since the decade before World War I, when the initiative movement originated with Progressives and took deep root in the youthfully optimistic, we-can-handle-it-ourselves West, has there been an election year with this many propositions up for a vote. Ten years ago, for example, there were only 41 statewide initiatives.

VPlanning a huge shift of resources in the last two weeks of the campaign, Dole officials say they will spend $4 million on advertising in California, praising Bob Dole for his honesty and his tax plan while accusing President Clinton of lying and of failing to halt illegal immigration. Meanwhile, the California Republican Party is buying a total of $1.7 million in advertising time, according to a Democratic analysis, for a commercial to support a ballot initiative that would eliminate state affirmative action programs.

VHoping for American gratitude and assistance, the English-speaking countries of the eastern Caribbean have in recent years devoted larger portions of their meager budgets to fighting drug trafficking. But now, to the dismay of many in the region, the United States is responding with a policy of economic retrenchment. Legislation to give Caribbean countries the same free-trade benefits as Mexico and Canada has been shelved in Congress, and a little-noticed provision of the minimum-wage bill that President Clinton signed in August eliminates Federal tax incentives to encourage low-interest loans to the region. Also, the two sides are in a bitter dispute over export quotas for bananas, the backbone of most economies in the area.

VTo find the heart of Bob Dole's hometown in these last unsettled days of his campaign, do not go to Dole headquarters on Main Street. Or to the afternoon coffee-and-pie gatherings of the town elders at Meridy's. Or even to the V.F.W. hall with the plaque honoring Dole outside and old war friends inside. Go no further then the cozy cocoon of sunflower prints, silk floral arrangements, cuckoo clocks and Bob Dole photographs that is the living room of Mr. Dole's eldest sister, Gloria Nelson, on West Fifth Street.

VA toxicologist testified for the defense today that the blood of the 16-year-old who said she was raped by Alex Kelly a decade ago showed that she had used cocaine and marijuana in the hours before the incident. The testimony given with the jury out of the courtroom was the first accusation that the accuser, now 26, had used cocaine. The defense, which has repeatedly attacked the woman's credibility, has suggested she became intoxicated, might have used marijuana and then flirted with Mr. Kelly, who was then 18, and agreed to consensual sex.

VNEW YORK The Yankees, and Nothing Else With its lungs and its heart, New York City saluted the triumphant Yankees in a rousing ticker tape parade up lower Broadway's Canyon of Heroes. For several hours in the middle of a splendiferous autumn day, work stopped, play stopped and the dog had to wait. It was Yankees and nothing else. $(Page A1.$) It was difficult to detect whether the Yankees or their maniacal fans were more elated. Call it mutual elation on this day of celebration. $(B6.$) Around the city, high school attendance slid from the usual 85 percent to 75 percent, or just over 12,000 revelers. $(B7.$) The show of affection for the New York Yankees became a profoundly personal triumph for Mayor Giuliani, the culmination of some of his favorite themes. $(B7.$) The Views From a Blimp Paul Adams wasn't moved by the cheers that echoed through lower Manhattan, where praise and ticker tape were heaped upon the triumphant Yankees. He's British and admits to a certain stiff-upper-lip reserve, which may explain why he stayed above it all. Actually, he floated more than 1,000 feet above it. He flies a blimp. This city has a special beauty, he said, which is more than he could say about the Meadowlands, which was once considered a real possibility as the site of a new Yankee Stadium. About New York by David Gonzalez. $(B1.$) Questions Raised on Tower Air Federal safety officials have concluded that the pilot of a Tower Airlines plane that slid off a Kennedy airport runway last December made two critical mistakes as he tried to lift the plane off the ground, and they said the accident raised troubling questions about the airline. $(B1.$) Rebuilding Downtown Brooklyn For the last 10 years, the rebuilding of downtown Brooklyn has quietly transformed the aged urban core of New York City's most populous borough into what experts have begun calling a model for big city downtowns across the nation. $(B1.$) Vallone Stumps for Proposal 2 For months, Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council, has been stumping hard for Proposal 2, the referendum on next Tuesday's ballot that would extend the maximum time a New York City official can stay in office to 12 years from 8. $(B4.$) Perjury Charges in Bomb Case A taxi driver from San Antonio, Tex., has been charged with lying to a Federal grand jury about a trip to Pakistan with a man who was later convicted of conspiring in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in Manhattan. $(B2.$) Infant in Car Accident Dies A baby who was removed from his dead mother's womb after she was killed by a car in Brooklyn died yesterday in a hospital, and the driver was charged with two counts of manslaughter. $(B2.$) Insurers Rediscover Poor Areas Insurance companies, which virtually wrote off the inner city in favor of the suburbs and wealthy pockets of cities, are now rediscovering poor and working-class urban neighborhoods. Business Day. $(D1.$) NEW JERSEY Strategies of a Senate Race With polls showing President Clinton enjoying a strong lead in New Jersey, Robert G. Torricelli, the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate, is counting on the Clinton-Gore ticket to help him into office. Meanwhile, advisers to Mr. Torricelli's Republican opponent, Richard A. Zimmer, fear a Clinton landslide could sink their candidate. $(A1.$) Representative Zimmer, in Paterson, emphasized the role he played in changing welfare. $(B8.$) Representative Torricelli, in Newark, reiterated that he is a staunch advocate of gun control laws. $(B8.$) The Contradictions of Zimmer Buttoned-down and erudite, Richard A. Zimmer, the three-term Republican Congressman who is now running for the United States Senate, is a study in contradictions. Raised in a solidly Democratic household of meager means, he made his way in politics through devotion to the Republican Party. While he is an impassioned conservative on many issues, he is moderate on others. $(B1.$) CONNECTICUT Defense Suggests Cocaine Use A toxicologist testified for the defense that the blood of the 16-year-old who said she was raped by Alex Kelly a decade ago showed that she had used cocaine and marijuana in the hours before the incident. The testimony given with the jury out of the courtroom was the first accusation that the accuser, now 26, had used cocaine. $(B4.$)

VBob Dole calls President Clinton's drug policies ''soft'' and ''liberal,'' a betrayal of what he says is the successful legacy of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. In fact, the Clinton Administration has taken the Republican drug war to soaring new heights of Draconian ineffectiveness. To see the distance we've traveled, consider the remarks of President Reagan in an Aug. 1, 1986, interview, published in his Presidential papers. When asked if he supported mandatory drug testing for Federal employees, Mr. Reagan replied, ''I have great concerns.'' He said that, except for employees like air traffic controllers and Federal agents who carry guns, ''I would rather see a voluntary program.''

VThe Clinton Administration has condemned it as a cynical hoax, the Republican Presidential candidate, Bob Dole, has denounced it as dangerous, and in a letter released today, former Presidents George Bush, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter call it a threat to the public health of ''all Americans.'' But in the battle over Proposition 215, the California initiative that would legalize the medical use of marijuana for people with AIDS, cancer and other diseases, polls show voters leaning away from politicians' dire warnings and toward the likes of Anna Boyce, a 67-year-old nurse shown in television advertisements that began appearing this week.

VPolls show California voters leaning away from dire warnings of politicians opposed to Proposition 215, initiative that would legalize medical use of marijuana for seriously ill; public support highlights shift in public opinion, as even initiative's foes acknowledge that people are siding ever more decisively with idea that seriously ill patients should have access to anything that will ease their suffering (M);

VThe prosecution in the Alex Kelly case tried today to block defense lawyers from presenting evidence to the jury that suggests the 16-year-old girl who said Mr. Kelly raped her had used drugs in the hours before the incident. But the day ended without a ruling from the judge. With the jury out of the courtroom for the full day, prosecutors brought in three toxicologists to challenge the scientific methods and conclusions of the defense toxicologist, Fredric Rieders, who asserted on Tuesday that he had found evidence of marijuana and cocaine in a 10-year-old dried blood sample from the woman.

VTo the Editor: Anthony Lewis (column, Oct. 25) accuses Bob Dole of lying about the Clinton Administration policy of not prosecuting some Mexican nationals caught smuggling drugs on the border. Two facts are undisputable: (1) The Clinton Justice Department abandoned prior administrations' zero-tolerance approach, and (2) as a result, hundred of Mexican nationals caught at the border with sizable quantities of drugs have faced no punishment more severe than loss of their border-crossing cards. Attorney General Janet Reno acknowledged as much in a May 21 letter to Senator Dole in which she outlined the absurd criteria for a drug-smuggler to qualify for such leniency. First, only Mexican nationals qualify. Another criterion is having less than 125 pounds of marijuana. So smugglers caught with ''only'' 100 pounds can still qualify for Ms. Reno's leniency.

VThe Reagan Presidency, still able to provoke arguments among politicians and historians, comes under scrutiny in ''The Reagan Legacy'' on ''Discovery Journal.'' Sunday's opening hour focuses on what has come to be known as Reaganomics; Monday brings back the Strategic Defense Initiative, a k a Star Wars. Both have figured in the Presidential campaign now reaching its climax or anticlimax, and both, by this incisive account, sprang full-blown from Mr. Reagan's philosophy and personality. Relying largely on eminences in the Reagan White House, ''Balancing Act'' on Sunday tells of how candidate Reagan's promise of a balanced budget gave way to President Reagan's determination to cut taxes and build up the nation's military.

VNEW YORK In Legislature, Change Elusive In a year when battles are raging for control of Congress, political scientists and strategists in both major parties predict that there will be only marginal changes in the New York Legislature. That prediction reflects New York's status as a great bastion of incumbency, where for years the two main parties, each controlling one house of the Legislature, have in essence worked together to preserve the status quo. $(Page B1.$) For Nike, Glitz Is Bottom Line Manhattan's newest megastore, NikeTown, may be less about making money than simply being what it seems: a very entertaining shrine to itself. Many retail and sporting good analysts said there seemed no way that NikeTown New York City, in planning for eight years, could actually make money. $(B1.$) Judge on Other Side of Bench For a volunteer ambulance corpsman in White Plains, a shooting in September represented two firsts. It was his first gunshot wound. And for the first time, the volunteer, who is formally known at his day job as Acting Justice Peter M. Leavitt of State Supreme Court in Westchester County, had just become a witness in a double homicide case. $(B1.$) Tuning Out on Term Limits The best that New York could come up with for a hot local issue this election year was Proposal 2, which is a referendum on term limits: not exactly a topic that gets the blood racing. All the same, it is important. NYC by Clyde Haberman. $(B1.$) Boost for Freight Operation A private company agreed to take over the Long Island Rail Road's small freight operation, a deal that both sides said would increase rail freight traffic on Long Island and return some life to the moribund Brooklyn docks. $(B3.$) Rape Case Roils West Point The revelation that a senior at the United States Military Academy in West Point had been charged with raping a female cadet took fellow cadets by surprise, challenging their belief that they lived in a moral universe more refined than the rest of the world and placing its protected reputation in jeopardy. $(B4.$) Political Funds Questioned A former official in the Iranian Government contributed $25,000 to a political action committee that is paying for an advertising campaign touting Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. The Democratic Party cited the contribution in a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission, asserting that the committee was merely a fund-raising vehicle. Mr. D'Amato dismissed the charges. $(B6.$) L.I. Race Marked by Animosity A contentious political campaign has gripped the First Congressional District on Long Island. Michael P. Forbes, the Republican incumbent, accuses his opponent of following a radical agenda. Nora Bredes, the Democratic challenger, counters that Mr. Forbes is a Newt Gingrich acolyte, a description not offered as a compliment.

VALASKA -- DOLE Alaska, where no Democratic Presidential candidate has won since 1964, cast its three electoral votes for Bob Dole. Senator Ted Stevens dispatched his Democratic challenger, Theresa Obermeyer. Ms. Obermeyer spent 30 days in Federal custody this summer after being accused of taking a swing at a security guard at a building where Mr. Stevens was attending a meeting. She finished third, after the Green party candidate, Jed Whittaker. An anti-hunting initiative was defeated. PRESIDENT 99% reporting Clinton -- 66,508 -- 33% Dole -- 101,234 -- 51% Perot -- 21,536 -- 11% SENATE 99% reporting Obermeyer -- 19,402 -- 10% Stevens -- 149,475 -- 77% Whittaker -- 24,219 -- 13% ARIZONA -- CLINTON President Clinton became the first Democrat since Harry S. Truman to win Arizona in a Presidential election. But the state also dealt Democrats a heartbreak, when voters in the Sixth District re-elected the Republican freshman Representative J. D. Hayworth by a meager margin of fewer than 600 votes, out of more than 240,000 cast. In his first term, Mr. Hayworth, a physically imposing former television sportscaster, infuriated Democrats by his outspoken partisanship and emphatic support of the Republican House leadership. In the state's Fifth District, Representative Jim Kolbe, a Republican who earlier this year acknowledged that he is a homosexual, was re-elected to a seventh term with 69 percent of the vote. PRESIDENT 99% reporting Clinton -- 612,412 -- 47% Dole -- 576,126 -- 44% Perot -- 104,712 -- 8% CALIFORNIA -- CLINTON Bob Dole decided to bank heavily on California, but President Clinton took the state by 13 percentage points. California is not the only place that puts public questions on its ballot, but the state has surely become the most renowned for doing so. This year three especially provocative issues were put to the voters. Proposition 209, which passed easily, crystallized what is almost certainly the most polarizing of contemporary domestic issues; it prohibits racial preferences in public hiring, contracting and education. Another ballot initiative that passed is supposed to legalize marijuana for medical use. A third would make it easier for shareholders to sue corporations for fraud. Although there were no contests for governor or senator, California had several interesting House races. Early in the year, the Republicans hoped to make a run at Representative Vic Fazio, the chairman of the Democratic caucus in the House. His opponent, Tim LeFever, barely lost to Mr. Fazio two years ago. But Mr. Fazio won re-election by a 13-point margin in his Sacramento Valley district, demonstrating how quickly the political tide can turn. In another rematch, Walter Holden Capps unseated a freshman Republican, Andrea Seastrand, who won her seat in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties in 1994 by one percentage point. PRESIDENT 100% reporting Clinton -- 4,639,935 -- 51% Dole -- 3,412,563 -- 38% Perot -- 667,702 -- 7% COLORADO -- DOLE Despite Bill Clinton's 10-point lead one month before the election, Bob Dole came from behind to take the state. Analysts attributed Mr. Clinton's loss to Ross Perot's infomercials attacking his integrity shortly before the election. In the Senate race, a Republican, Wayne Allard, defeated his Democratic opponent, Tom Strickland, to win the seat vacated by Hank Brown, who is retiring. With the help of Mr. Clinton and Mayor Wellington Webb of Denver, the Democratic candidate in the First Congressional District, Diana DeGette, defeated her Republican opponent, Joe Rogers. Tensions rose among some black voters when Mr. Webb, a black Democrat, endorsed Ms. DeGette, who is white, over Mr. Rogers, who is black. PRESIDENT 100% reporting Clinton -- 670,854 -- 44% Dole -- 691,291 -- 46% Perot -- 99,509 -- 7% SENATE 100% reporting Strickland -- 677,151 -- 46% Allard -- 748,516 -- 51% HAWAII -- CLINTON So confident were they that Hawaii Democrats would come through for President Clinton one more time, neither candidate bothered to campaign in the state, and local newspapers did not conduct polls. In the First Congressional District, the Democratic incumbent, Neil Abercrombie, defeated his Republican rival, Orson Swindle, in one of the nastiest races the islands had ever seen. Mr. Swindle, a newcomer to the islands who was Ross Perot's spokesman in the 1992 Presidential race, branded Mr. Abercrombie a far-left hippie. PRESIDENT 100% reporting Clinton -- 205,012 -- 57% Dole -- 113,943 -- 32% Perot -- 27,358 -- 8% IDAHO -- DOLE Democrats had hoped they could crack Idaho's fairly consistent record of electing Republicans, but their efforts failed. Bob Dole carried the state by an overwhelming margin, while Senator Larry E. Craig, a Republican, won a second term and both the state's Republican representatives won, too. The victories of Senator Craig and Representative Helen Chenoweth represented setbacks for liberals and environmentalists. Voters also decided in a referendum to allow continued shipments of nuclear waste to the state provided that the Federal Government clean up most of it by 2035. PRESIDENT 100% reporting Clinton -- 165,545 -- 34% Dole -- 256,406 -- 52% Perot -- 62,506 -- 13% SENATE 100% reporting Minnick -- 198,415 -- 40% Craig -- 283,530 -- 57% MONTANA -- DOLE The race for Governor was thrown into turmoil when the Democratic candidate, Chet Blaylock, 71, died of a heart attack nearly two weeks ago. The Democrats chose his running mate, State Senator Judy Jacobson, to replace him on the ballot. Voters, however, re-elected Gov. Marc Racicot. Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat seeking re-election, came on strong in the final week of the campaign to defeat Lieut. Gov. Dennis Rehberg, a Republican. The retirement of Representative Pat Williams, a Democrat, presented an opening to the Republicans, whose candidate, Rick Hill, captured the state's at-large House seat. Mr. Hill defeated Bill Yellowtail, a former Democratic State Senator. PRESIDENT 99% reporting Clinton -- 167,169 -- 41% Dole -- 178,957 -- 44% Perot -- 55,017 -- 14% GOVERNOR 99% reporting Jacobson -- 69,925 -- 20% Racicot -- 272,013 -- 80% SENATE 99% reporting Baucus -- 200,549 -- 50% Rehberg -- 180,863 -- 45% NEVADA -- CLINTON Representative John Ensign was among those freshman Republicans who ran in tight races in which their opponents hung Speaker Newt Gingrich around their necks. But Mr. Ensign retained his seat by winning 50 percent of the vote to 44 percent for his Democratic challenger, State Senator Bob Coffin, in the First District, which is based in Las Vegas. In the Second District in Reno, Democrats failed to pick up the seat vacated by a retiring Republican, Representative Barbara F. Vucanovich. Jim Gibbons, a former Republican State Assemblyman, easily defeated Thomas Wilson, a Democrat. PRESIDENT 100% reporting Clinton -- 202,807 -- 44% Dole -- 197,554 -- 43% Perot -- 43,698 -- 9% NEW MEXICO -- CLINTON New Mexico supported Bill Clinton in 1992 and gave him its five electoral votes by a comfortable margin this year. Senator Pete V. Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, did not worry for a moment about his quest for a fifth term. The Republican Senator, by far the state's most popular politician, easily defeated Art Trujillo, a Democrat and the former Mayor of Sante Fe. All three members of the House of Representatives -- two Republicans, Steven H. Schiff and Joe Skeen, and a Democrat, Bill Richardson -- coasted to victory. PRESIDENT 99% reporting Clinton -- 252,215 -- 49% Dole -- 210,791 -- 41% Perot -- 30,978 -- 6% SENATE 99% reporting Trujillo -- 152,742 -- 30% Domenici -- 326,053 -- 64% OREGON -- CLINTON President Clinton's victory in Oregon never really seemed in doubt, but the Senate race went down to the wire, with many mail ballots remaining to be counted. Gordon Smith, a Republican and president of the State Senate, faced Tom Bruggere, a computer software executive, for the Senate seat vacated by a Republican, Mark Hatfield. Mr. Bruggere, a Democrat, was making his first run for public office. The House races were roiled by the withdrawal of Representative Wes Cooley, a Republican freshman, after news reports showed he had lied about his war record in Korea and about his marriage. Mr. Cooley's replacement, former Republican Representative Bob Smith, defeated Mike Dugan. PRESIDENT 95% reporting Clinton -- 326,099 -- 47% Dole -- 256,100 -- 37% Perot -- 73,265 -- 11% SENATE 95% reporting Bruggere -- 318,232 -- 47% Smith -- 334,171 -- 49% UTAH -- DOLE President Clinton did his party no good in Utah when he designated a vast swath of desert as a national monument, ending plans for mining and oil drilling. Mr. Clinton had no chance of carrying Utah. But he may have hurt the state's sole Democratic representative, Bill Orton, who lost to Christopher B. Cannon. Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican, easily won re-election. PRESIDENT 100% reporting Clinton -- 220,197 -- 33% Dole -- 359,394 -- 54% Perot -- 66,100 -- 10% GOVERNOR 100% reporting Bradley -- 155,294 -- 23% Leavitt -- 500,293 -- 75% WASHINGTON -- CLINTON The Clinton-Gore ticket swept to an expected victory while the Democrats also succeeded in dislodging three of Washington State's six Republican freshmen. The three Republicans turned out after two years were Randy Tate (by Adam Smith), Linda Smith (by Brian Baird) and Jack Metcalf (by Kevin Quigley). In the contest to succeed Gov. Mike Lowry, a Democrat, the King County Executive, Gary Locke defeated Ellen Craswell to become the first Asian-American governor of a continental state. PRESIDENT 99% reporting Clinton -- 899,645 - 51% Dole -- 639,743 -- 36% Perot -- 161,642 -- 9% GOVERNOR 98% reporting Locke -- 1,038,078 -- 59% Craswell -- 721,034 -- 41% WYOMING -- DOLE Hardly any state is more Republican than Wyoming, the least populous state, and Bob Dole easily collected its three electoral votes. The Republicans also easily took the Senate race to succeed Alan K. Simpson that at one time was thought close enough to give Wyoming Democrats their first real Senate shot in almost 30 years. Barbara Cubin easily won re-election to her House seat. PRESIDENT 100% reporting Clinton -- 77,897 -- 37% Dole -- 105,347 -- 50% Perot -- 25,854 -- 12% SENATE 100% reporting Karpan -- 88,559 -- 42% Enzi -- 113,630 -- 54%

VSupporters of a measure to dismantle state-sponsored affirmative action programs in California predicted yesterday that its approval would begin a new era of equal opportunity by wiping out preferences based on race or sex in public hiring, contracting and college admissions. But civil rights advocates said that the results did not necessarily foreshadow a surge of opposition to affirmative action in other states or in Congress.

VSo, to sum it all up with clarity and charity: The American people chose as President a man most of them do not trust and who has not revealed his goals for his new administration, except to build some kind of cockamamie bridge. And, God bless America, they were right -- given the circumstances. As I walked to cast my grumpy vote I was mindful of the time a couple of years ago when the doctor told me I had to have coronary bypass surgery. That seemed outrageous. I demanded to know the alternative. He informed me immediately. Given the circumstances I leapt toward the operating room. Now the blood courses like a wild torrent through my body lithe and lean.

VSince this summer, a new contraband has been running second only to marijuana in the Customs seizures made here on the Mexican border. It is more profitable than cocaine by some estimates, believed to be bigger business these days than gun-running, and illegal to import for a futuristic reason: it harms the planet. It is that old staple on car-repair shop shelves, Freon. And it is taking on a sinister new role as the contraband of tomorrow.

VCITIZEN K The Deeply Weird American Journey of Brett Kimberlin. By Mark Singer. 381 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $25. IN the dark night of a journalist's soul, it is not only 3 o'clock in the morning but there is also a source on the line. The connection is bad but the sentence fragments that come through suggest a massive conspiracy, a gripping yarn, an explosive revelation: a great story. The dark night continues the next day: when the journalist attempts to verify the source's tale, he finds that some parts do indeed check out, while others turn in on themselves in a maddeningly elusive tautological conundrum -- ''a black hole,'' in the recurring metaphor Mark Singer uses in ''Citizen K'' -- and still others appear to be simply false.

VMarijuana! Reefer madness! Did you-know-who inhale or not inhale 25 years ago? The hypocrisy surrounding the subject of pot is astounding. Even the electorate seems to be fed up with it. A gesture toward perspective is attempted tonight in, of all places, a sitcom. CBS's ''Ink,'' starring Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, delicately tackles a subject that tends to leave so-called drug czars looking like fools. The newspaper journalists Mike Logan (Mr. Danson) and his former wife, Kate Montgomery (Ms. Steenburgen), baby-boomers both, are stunned to find a bag of grass belonging to their 15-year-old daughter, Abby (Alana Austin). ''Oh my God,'' exclaims Mom, ''and she's a Republican,'' a status that Dad suspects is the leading cause of death among teen-age girls.

VBy her own reckoning, Gloria Jones could hardly have been a worse mother. She was unwed, unemployed and a chronic drug abuser. Discipline often meant a scream and a slap. And she had lost her children to foster care twice because of neglect, and was on the verge of losing them permanently. That is when Charles Thomas came into her life. Instead of removing Ms. Jones's three daughters again, a judge assigned Mr. Thomas, a social worker and family therapist, to smother her with constant guidance and attention.

VTen years after a 16-year-old girl from Darien accused Alex Kelly of rape, his trial ended today with a deadlocked jury and an extraordinary exchange of bitter accusations. After a six-week trial and four days of deliberations, Judge Martin L. Nigro of Superior Court here declared a mistrial this afternoon, giving Mr. Kelly a chance for a new trial and leaving his accuser to once again attempt to persuade a jury that she was telling the truth.

VA jury today convicted a television talk show guest of second-degree murder in the death of another guest who had declared a homosexual attraction to him. Jonathan T. Schmitz, 26, was found guilty of killing Scott Amedure, 32, with two blasts from a shotgun, three days after both men were taped on ''The Jenny Jones Show.'' But the jury, focusing on evidence that Mr. Schmitz was manic-depressive, concluded that he had not acted with premeditation or deliberation, the legal tests that must be met under Michigan law for a first-degree murder conviction.

VThe Nixon Center for Peace and Pragmatism (formerly Freedom) demeaned itself this week by using Lee Kuan Yew, the dictator of Singapore, as the draw to raise $400,000 for its staff's salaries. Two of the young men thus subsidized took umbrage at my criticism of this ''Architect of the New Century'' award that Henry Kissinger arranged be given to his tinpot-tyrant friend. They complained hotly in a letter to The New York Times that ''there is something bigoted'' in my objection to such kowtowing. ''Bigoted''? For a long generation, I have been defending Richard Nixon from appearances of bigotry on his tapes. I do not appreciate having that ugly motive attributed to me by foundationiks who were in knee pants during Nixon's wilderness years. Ironically, that same racial innuendo is being used by President Clinton, who last week sought to discredit reporting of the corruption scandal brewing around his fund-raiser John Huang with ''there has been a lot of rather disparaging comments made about Asian-Americans.'' Sorry, it won't wash; corruption and repression of dissent, which go hand in hand, afflict every race. Dictator Lee is the man who said of elections, ''The government will not be blackmailed by the people,'' and for years derided Western values of free speech and individual liberty as ''decadent.'' But under Henry's tutelage this week, Lee was a changed man. ''Asians have quietly adopted useful Western values, social practices and management methods to varying degrees,'' Singapore's strongman soothed the $1,000-a-platers in Washington, ''and now have a blend of East and West in their value systems.'' In praising the Clinton decision to de-link China's human rights actions from trade advantages, Singapore's boss-for-life even departed from text to assert, ''I am not against human rights or democracy.'' That ringing declaration was worthy of an Architect of the New Century, even though it was prelude to his warning against using ''external pressure or sanctions'' on Chinese leaders now jailing more dissenters. Lee also urged Clinton to bring China into the World Trade Organization, a strategy of pre-emptive concession. (Privately, Lee is pushing for his Tommy Koh as U.N. Secretary General, which would be a disaster.) ''What's your hang-up about Harry Lee?'' an old Nixon hand asks me, using the name the Architect used to go by. ''Isn't he tough on drugs? And isn't he good for global business?'' About drugs: Lee has won plaudits for hanging anyone caught even possessing 500 grams of marijuana. But the death-to-potheads set does not know that Singapore is the biggest trading partner of, and a heavy investor in, the military dictatorship of Burma -- a world center of heroin distribution. Backers of the Burmese dissident Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who want to stop the drug traffic, have no friend in Lee Kuan Yew. When the Australian broadcaster Michael Carey questioned potential ties between Singapore investments and the drug lords protected by Burma's junta, Lee harassed a leader of one of the tiny opposition parties for daring to appear on the program. About business, and the Singapore planes running on time: In the information age, the electronics-packed island seeks to become the ''intelligent island,'' center of Asian communications. But here is where technology's progress runs into the stone wall of political repression. Lee's ultimate enemy is the Internet. Lee's son and designated successor boasts he can control Internet access and thereby block the computer window to the world -- with all its subversive political ideas -- under cover of protecting Asian eyes from Western pornography. For example, Singaporeans cannot get to the ''hot'' Web site run by freedom-minded Chinese students at Stanford U. Let's run a test. ''Information Technology and Political Control in Singapore'' is a paper just issued by Prof. Gary Rodan of Murdoch University in Perth, Australia, distributed by Chalmers Johnson of the Japan Policy Research Institute in Cardiff, Calif. It's on this Web site: http://www.nmjc.org/jpri/. If Lee blocks access, Singaporeans, try E-mail: cjohnson@ucsd. edu. But be careful, global business executives: the Architect of the New Century may be monitoring everything you download.

V''Drug money'' used to mean just one thing -- the fortunes manipulated by drug criminals. Last week, while America slept, it took on one more meaning: the gobs of money contributed by a few rich Americans determined to put across state ballot-propositions that would widen the use of narcotics, and without penalty. Successful in California and Arizona, drug legalizers, their foundations and financial backers have a carefully crafted strategy. Election by election, they plan to push through more state legalization measures. They always had the will, now they have the money.

VDAWN broke over the Mount Pleasant housing development in New Britain as the police teams swept through. A few minutes earlier, more than 50 state and city police officers had entered three apartments, searching for people wanted on drug charges. Now, with a half-dozen suspects locked away in a confinement van, investigators were combing through hallways and alleys, hunting for stragglers. Capt. Dennis Beatty, in charge of the New Britain Police Department's investigations division, stood on a road between the targeted apartments, watching the proceedings stoically. He noted that Mount Pleasant has a reputation that belies its name. Earlier this year, a man was killed on a street corner a few yards away in what Captain Beatty called ''a drug deal gone bad.''

VInternational REFUGEES OVERWHELM RWANDA Facing a tide of humanity, Rwandan troops and aid workers gave up on holding Rwandan refugees in a temporary camp near the border, and instead directed them to march straight into the country, without any formalities. 1 NORTH KOREA'S LAST COMMANDO Somewhere in the mountains near the gash of barbed wire and trenches that divides the Korean Peninsula, a single North Korean commando is thought to be hiding, trying to sneak back home after having evaded 60,000 South Korean troops. 6 SLOWER POPULATION GROWTH A new survey by the United Nations has found that the world's population has suddenly begun growing more slowly than expected even a few years ago. 3 EXPLOSION IN SOUTHERN RUSSIA As many as 32 people were killed when an explosion destroyed a building housing Russian military officers in the southern region of Dagestan. 3 POPE AND CASTRO TO MEET Pope John Paul II will meet Fidel Castro on Tuesday, an encounter that could lead to a papal visit to Cuba, the Vatican announced. 4 INDIA AFTER THE CRASH Dozens of relatives of the victims of a midair collision near New Delhi made exhausting journeys to the Indian capital, many of them in buses and cars over days, to identify bodies. 6 CLINTON HEADS TO ASIA President Clinton arrived in Hawaii Friday night, hoping to gird himself for state visits to Australia and Thailand and for an Asian-Pacific economic conference this week in the Philippines. 6 A CHANGE IN CHILE While many Latins say they admire Chile's economic success, others say prosperity is altering the character of the country, turning arrogant a people long viewed as shy and reserved. 8 REFUGEES IN THE BALKANS The right of refugees to return to their homes is a basic tenet of the Bosnian peace accord, but officials say that Croatia has set up a dizzying array of bureaucratic roadblocks to keep away Serbs. 8 National BITTER FIGHT FOR A UNION By most accounts, the race for teamsters' union president is neck-and-neck, pitting one of the most famous labor names against a man hailed by many for cleansing a notoriously corrupt union. 1 MCDONNELL DOUGLAS OUT Narrowing a hotly contested battle to build a one-size-fits-all combat aircraft, the Pentagon eliminated the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the contender that had the most to lose from being cut. 1 LEGAL VS. ILLEGAL DRUG USE By approving initiatives to permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes, California and Arizona voters have touched off a nationwide battle over illegal drugs. 16 KLAN MUSEUM OPEN ''The World's Only Klan Museum,'' with its ''Redneck Shop,'' is open for business in Laurens, S.C., awaiting the outcome of a Federal lawsuit that challenges the city's refusal to grant the museum a license to operate. 16 INSECT SPRAY LEAVES DANGER Investigators say that two unlicensed exterminators sprayed at least 300 houses and businesses in Mississippi, including up to five day-care centers, with a toxic insecticide approved only for outdoor use. 23 LANGUAGE WAR AT DEVILS LAKE The name Devils Lake has spurred a language war between whites and Indians living near North Dakota's largest natural lake. 28 CORPORATE VULNERABILITY News analysis: Texaco's decision to settle a Federal discrimination lawsuit provides evidence of how vulnerable consumer-oriented corporations can be to bad publicity and outside pressure. 20 H.M.O.'S CLAIM IMMUNITY Health maintenance organizations say they cannot be held responsible for medical malpractice in cases involving patients who receive care through an employer-sponsored health plan, an assertion the Clinton Administration calls absurd. 24 Metropolitan BACK TO SCHOOL, FROM JAIL For a growing number of teen-agers across the country, getting into school after getting out of jail means crossing a precarious threshold, their home and street lives constantly threatening to unravel their progress or lure them back to a criminal world. 1 MOVE TO RETURN WOLVES TO EAST A nascent effort to return gray wolves to New York State -- specifically, the Adirondacks -- is gaining new traction with the widely publicized success of the Yellowstone reintroduction program. 1 SUBWAY TUNNELS TO NOWHERE The New York subway system was envisioned to go far more places than it does today. Some of this elaborately plotted system never emerged from planners' doodles but a surprising amount of it can be seen in concrete, brick and tile in spur lines leading to nowhere. 37 Obituaries 45

VTo the Editor: Bravo to A. M. Rosenthal on his Nov. 15 column decrying the passage of California and Arizona amendments legalizing medical use of marijuana. A large war chest and deceptive advertising campaign appealed to the compassion we have for our fellow citizens, and the amendments sailed through. The legalizers' ads avoided mention of scientific studies that correlate serious health and mental consequences with marijuana use.

VThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that once the police have stopped a car for a traffic infraction, they may go on to request the driver's permission to search the car for drugs without first informing him that the routine stop is over and that he is, in fact, free to go on his way. The Court overturned a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that a driver's consent to a search can never be valid under such circumstances unless the police first inform him that ''at this time, you are legally free to go.''

VNEW YORK Court Allows Damage Claims Sweeping away years of lower court rulings, New York's highest court said that people can seek monetary damages from the state government for violating their rights under the State Constitution. The ruling by the Court of Appeals significantly expands the protections of the State Constitution and opens a new avenue for claims against state agencies, legal experts said. $(Page A1.$) Mayor Presses Superstore Plan Stepping up the political battle over superstores, Mayor Giuliani is running radio commercials to promote his plan to allow the stores in some areas. At the same time, he harshly attacked Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President and a likely mayoral candidate, who is running ads against the plan. $(B1.$) A poll suggests that Mayor Giuliani would defeat any of his potential Democratic challengers if the 1997 election were held today. $(B10.$) Do-It-Yourself Divorces After obtaining several orders of protection, Pamela Russell yearned for a divorce. She called Harlem Legal Services, where she learned of a project to help battered women get divorces on their own. $(B1.$) Convicted Lawyer's Campaign No one believed Joel Proyect would serve time for growing his own pot. Yet it happened. And now, released after three years and four months in the Danbury Federal prison, he plans to talk and write about decriminalizing marijuana. Our Towns by Evelyn Nieves. $(B1.$) Following Dad's Drumbeats At 10 years old, Sam Sanford Jr. is a percussion prodigy. He blends the old-style soul his father played with the fast-paced hip-hop he hears on the streets. He devours old recordings, especially by James Brown, a k a the Godfather of Soul. Call him the Godson of Soul. About New York by David Gonzalez. $(B3.$) Hospitals Chief Resigns Maria K. Mitchell, Mayor Giuliani's chief health policy adviser, is resigning to head a new consortium of hospitals and medical schools aimed at reinvigorating biomedical research in New York. $(B4.$) Hospital Lawsuit, and Layoffs A hospital workers' union went to court to collect almost $14 million owed to its pension and benefits fund by the Interfaith Medical Center of Brooklyn, prompting the hospital to lay off 330 employees. $(B4.$) A Plan for the Erie Canal The Federal Government is about to announce a $100 million revitalization of the waterfronts along the Erie Canal, a plan aimed at increasing tourism. $(B6.$) Final Day for Adelphi Hearing A state panel considering the removal of Adelphi University's trustees concludes 27 days of hearings today, having painted a much fuller -- yet incomplete -- picture of a central issue: compensation for the president, Peter Diamandopoulos. $(B6.$) Chancellor Continues Fight Continuing his fight for control over a troubled South Bronx school district, Chancellor Rudy Crew asked the Justice Department to reconsider its decision that he violated the Voting Rights Act by suspending the board members and replacing them with his appointees. $(B8.$) Former Gang Leader Convicted The deposed leader of one of New York City's most notorious gangs, the Latin Kings, was convicted by a Federal jury of orchestrating the murders and attempted murders of rivals from his prison cell in upstate New York. $(B9.$) REGION A T.W.A. Victim Is Identified Using DNA testing, medical investigators have identified another victim of the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, lowering the number of missing victims to 15 of the 230 people who died in the July explosion. National Report. $(A22.$) NEW JERSEY Expanded Search for Fugitive Even as the authorities widened their search for a convicted former New Jersey prosecutor who slipped away from house arrest, the Federal Government won the right to seize four properties that he had posted as bond, including his elderly mother's condominium. $(B1.$) Teen-Age Suspect Still Missing Frustrated that the college student accused with his girlfriend of killing their newborn son had not yet turned himself in, police in Delaware declared the New Jersey teen-ager a fugitive and called in Federal officials to find him. $(B6.$) Debate Over Prekindergarten A decision by the Montclair Board of Education to close its free, racially integrated prekindergarten program set off a debate so intense that the board promised to keep it running, somehow, for at least another year. The debate comes as educators are calling for more affordable, high-quality preschool programs. $(B11.$)

VNO one believed Joel Proyect would serve time. Even the judge who was forced to hand him a five-year term under Federal mandatory-sentencing laws urged the Court of Appeals to overturn it. Mr. Proyect, after all, was a man who spent his life defending the weak and the poor, putting in long hours at his one-person law office in South Fallsburg, often for no pay. His colleagues had recently elected him vice president of the Sullivan County Bar Association. His neighbors had vouched publicly for his honor and decency.

VAleksandr I. Lebed is the Russian general who became a politician and has no doubt that he will be Russia's next president. He says 25 years as a paratrooper taught him to talk concretely. In New York this week he used one word to describe Russia's efforts to prevent its nuclear warheads and materials from being stolen for terrorists or by rogue missile crews: ''unsatisfactory.'' But when it came to talking about what would then happen, he could not find concrete words in him. Nobody had ever lived in such a world, he said -- horrors unseen, dangers never conceived. When he said this to a few Russian and American journalists at the Regency Hotel I felt this man who looks like square rock and talks like rolling thunder was even more shaken than we were, because he knows more.

VBefore the high school basketball players in ''Hoop Dreams'' were even born, before the N.B.A. was the big-money publicity machine it has become, there were boys from poor urban families whose talent was squandered, misused or cheaply sold before they made it to the pros. One of the most compelling of these real-life stories is that of Earl Manigault, a playground legend of the 60's, whose ability might have rivaled that of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, his contemporary. Instead, he detoured into heroin addiction and prison. By the time of his personal redemption, it was much too late for his career. ''Rebound: The Legend of Earl (the Goat) Manigault'' is a smooth fictional version of this story, directed with an understated hand by the actor Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton on ''E.R.''). At times the film has the verve to leap off the screen. When a slickly handsome drug dealer named Legrand (Michael Beach, in the film's most seductive performance), first meets the teen-ager on the playground, he mishears the name Manigault. ''Did he say Nanny Goat?'' Legrand asks, explaining the nickname in one quick, witty stroke.

VTo the Editor: A. M. Rosenthal is right (column, Nov. 15). The organizers for Proposition 215 in California and 200 in Arizona performed a masterly task of misleading the public. In California, under the guise of making marijuana available for the terminally ill, they crafted a proposition that has no age restrictions, no definition of medical need (''any other illness for which marijuana provides relief'') and only needs a doctor's oral recommendation.

VShots from a .45-caliber handgun were fired at her through the window of her cottage as she put her 5-year-old son to bed. The country's most notorious criminal beat her up and threatened to sodomize her child and kill her entire family. An intruder in a crash helmet forced his way into her home, held a gun to her temple for agonizing seconds, then lowered it to her thigh and pulled the trigger. ''No journalist believes he or she will ever be shot,'' Veronica Guerin, 36, wrote in early February as she recuperated from her wound. She said she would not be deterred from continuing to write about Dublin's underworld but confided that getting shot had been ''the most frightening moment of my life,'' one ''I hope I shall never have to face again.''

VTRICKY, THE ENGLISH DANCE music maverick, is one of the most important musicians recording today. A former miscreant from the streets and jail cells of Bristol, he has been rearranging the face of pop music from the outside. In his hands, loping beats cobbled out of sound effects and laid-back vocals that forebode and reverberate as if delivered from the barrel of a shotgun have been turned into a new lounge music for a society on the edge of cataclysm. A fast-moving, instinct-driven chameleon, he has in the last three months released three albums, each one an attempt to prove that he can approach any style of music (be it punk, hip-hop or pop) and do it differently and better than anyone else. Tricky is a huckster, a burned-out scam artist who has started to believe his own braggadocio as much as he does the press clippings calling him a genius. A former member of the Massive Attack dance-music collective, he has, since his promising first album, ''Maxinquaye,'' merely succeeded in letting the air out of the hopes the music world had for him, proving himself to be little more than a rapper compensating for the fact that he can't rap. A collaboration with members of the Wu-Tang Clan only demonstrated how much of Tricky's sound was derived from that hip-hop group's recordings. With his next three albums, he walked into the studio boasting about how he could do anything in any style and blow anyone away. But he just ended up with lazier, more scattered albums that all sounded similar.

VInternational HIJACKED JET CRASHES An Ethiopian airliner that was hijacked with 175 people aboard crashed on a beach of the Comoro Islands in the Indian Ocean, killing more than 50 people. 1 SAVING LITHUANIAN JEWISH BOOKS Tens of thousands of rare Hebrew and Yiddish texts have been forgotten about in Lithuania, one of the largest and least accessible such collections in the world. 1 U.S. SHADOW ON GLOBAL TRADE The intense Asian interest in American domestic politics can be explained by the central role of the United States in setting or vetoing the rules of global trade. 1 President Clinton arrived for the Pacific summit meeting. 12 FRONT LINE AGAINST EBOLA Eighteen months after an Ebola outbreak killed at least 244 people, scientists have chosen a remote national park in the Ivory Coast as the front line in fighting the disease. 3 CORRUPTION LINGERS IN JAPAN As Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto tries to press ahead with his campaign for deregulation, his new Government is under attack because of corruption scandals. 12 The Unification Church is making inroads in Latin America. 14 National WASHINGTON GUESSING GAME With President Clinton out of the country, the parlor game du jour of the foreign policy establishment -- predicting who will become the nation's next Secretary of State -- is being played with feverish intensity back home. 1 ECONOMIC DATA FLAWED? A senior Clinton Administration official warns that the quality of the economic statistics produced by the Government has been eroding steadily, increasing doubts about how accurately they depict the nation's economic activity. 1 TOUGH TIMES FOR ARMY'S TEACHERS Drill sergeants, entrusted with absolute authority over young recruits who must obey their every command, are under new scrutiny because some have taken advantage of that power to sexually harass or assault their soldiers. 18 TRIAL DATE SET IN TOBACCO SUIT A Florida judge has set a trial date for next Sept. 8 in a statewide class action against leading tobacco companies, accusing them of causing illness. 35 MARIJUANA FARMS FLOURISH With the expansion of domestic growing of marijuana, and particularly the proliferation of indoor gardens, high-grade marijuana is more available now than ever before. 18 SELLING A CHEMICAL DEPOT SITE Among real estate salesmen who have worked to dismember the nearly 300 military installations that Washington has closed in the last decade, Charles Finley faces one of the toughest challenges: marketing space at a chemical depot in Colorado. 24 TV SHOW HELPS REVIVE BALTIMORE A revitalized Baltimore has attracted not only new residents, shops and restaurants but also the television production company for ''Homicide, Life on the Street,'' the critically acclaimed police drama. 22 BORDER DROWNINGS RAISE ALARMS At least four men were swept to their deaths off a Gulf of Mexico sandbar last week, and an immigration research group sees a connection between this latest fatal incident involving would-be immigrants and increased Federal border enforcement. 19 Metropolitan TRAIN DERAILS IN MEADOWLAND An Amtrak fast-mail train approaching New York with 108 passengers and crew members derailed as it crossed a Hackensack River swing bridge on a desolate New Jersey meadowland. After sideswiping an oncoming passenger train, six cars of the mail train plunged down a 30-foot embankment. No one was killed, but Amtrak said 32 people were injured and dozens of passengers were shaken and terrified. 1 TOURISTS FLOOD HARLEM CHURCHES A decade-long influx of foreign tourists visiting Harlem churches has swelled considerably over the last year, to the point where Harlem on a Sunday morning has been transformed into something of an ecclesiastical theme park. Charter buses roll in by the dozens. Tourists spill out by the thousands, pointing cameras at churchgoers like paparazzi swirling around celebrities at a movie premiere. 37 HIGH SCHOOLS FOUND TO GET LESS The superintendents who oversee New York City's elementary and middle schools have long complained that the city's high schools soaked up a disproportionate share of education dollars. So it came as a surprise when the most exhaustive accounting in the system's history concluded that the high schools actually get much less. 37

VHE studied painting at Syracuse University, and 45 years later he still goes to museums to look for ideas. Besides his own LP's, he listens to tapes and CD's that arrive in the mail. Sometimes he commissions music (which he says he doesn't know much about) for his company. Yet Paul Taylor is acclaimed not as a painter, nor as a musician, nor as a patron, nor as a chief executive. The world knows him as a dancer turned choreographer, a master at making dances. He absorbs, without bias, contemporary culture's profane and sublime aspects, displaying them in dances of extrovert optimism and momentum. ''I had the sense he was going to be a choreographer,'' said Linda Hodes, the director of his young touring group, Taylor 2. Like Mr. Taylor, she once danced in Martha Graham's company. ''He knew what he wanted and had such a fabulous, individual way of moving. He's amazingly musical. I hear music differently after I've heard it through his eyes.''

The Fight Against Ebola Eighteen months after an Ebola outbreak in Zaire killed 244 people, scientists have chosen a remote national park in Ivory Coast as the front line in fighting the disease. Page 3. Scrutiny for Army Teachers Scandals involving sexual assaults and other misconduct at several military bases have left the Army's drill sergeants, and those who train them, under scrutiny. Page 18. Marijuana Comes Indoors Several recent raids in Florida underscore the increasing tendency of marijuana growers to bring their crops indoors, where they can raise higher-potency plants.

VWhen he was not on his Slim-Fast liquid diet, Nicholas L. Bissell Jr. would occasionally leave his office here for lunch, with his aides in tow. In those years, before he became famous as the fugitive former prosecutor who provoked an international manhunt after fleeing house arrest on Nov. 18, he was a local celebrity here, the self-proclaimed toughest county prosecutor in New Jersey. The lunchtime destination was a place that served courthouse regulars, like the restaurant his father ran here for several years. But instead of watching the insiders, as he had as a child, he was now the most important insider of all. And some people thought the spotlight was his main reward.

VThe Dallas Cowboys, who recently regained their balance after being knocked off stride by an off season of woes and a dismal 2-3 start to the season, are being battered again. A day after suffering a humiliating 20-6 loss to the Giants, Dallas awaited the results of a magnetic resonance imaging scan on running back Emmitt Smith's injured ankle and braced for a growing storm over Coach Barry Switzer's decision to bench the superstar in the third quarter of the game. Also, the team is being dogged by questions surrounding published and broadcast reports about its talented defensive tackle Leon Lett and whether he has again violated the league's substance abuse policy.

VFour houses seized from a Camden drug dealer will be used to fight drugs. Yesterday, the Internal Revenue Service turned over two of the buildings confiscated from Walter Holland to the Camden Police Department to serve as substations. The other buildings were given to community groups that work to keep young people away from drugs. Mr. Holland pleaded guilty in September to laundering $100,000 in marijuana profits. I.R.S. officials said he bought the houses, which were worth a combined $125,000, as part of the scheme to hide his assets.

V''I'm terrified of entering those eerie shadows,'' Kathleen Chang wrote in the last entry of a journal she called her ''Die-ery'' because in it she detailed her plans to kill herself. It was not a new thought. At 14, she found her mother dead in bed, a suicide by overdose of barbiturates, in their home in Riverdale. Even before, young Kathy had slashed her wrists. In that last entry, she wondered if she would ''chicken out.'' But on a gray morning last month, Ms. Chang, 46, walked from her home in Philadelphia to the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, where for 15 years she had staged lonely demonstrations to ''stop business as usual'' for a peaceful new world that she, as a self-styled messiah, would bring to life.

VSan Francisco Opera's staging of the opera Harvey Milk is enthusiastically received by city's gay community, which Milk led in the 1970's and where the opening is an occasion for nostalgia and celebration; favorable reviews are gratifying to the composer, Stewart Wallace, librettist, Michael Korie, and cast, especially after its less than successful run at New York City Opera (M)

VThe passage of voter initiatives in California and Arizona allowing the medical use of marijuana has caused renewed interest in a little-known Government program at the University of Mississippi that supplies marijuana for medicinal purposes to eight people across the country. ''There has definitely been more public attention to medical marijuana,'' Allen St. Pierre, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said on Thursday. ''But the increased attention has been bittersweet because there has been so much misinformation on the subject. We get so many calls when people hear of the program and want to know how they can apply or how it can be legal for eight and not for others.''

VO.K., you're innocent. They always say that. It wasn't you, you say, who was walking down the street drinking that beer, relieving yourself against the wall, scalping those tickets to the United States Open or smoking that joint in Washington Square Park. But that is for the courts to decide. The fact remains, gentle reader, that you have been busted. A police officer has just put you under arrest and you are about to enter the unnerving behemoth known to cops and robbers alike as ''the system.''

VInternational 3-20 BEHIND THE SAUDI VEIL A special C.I.A. task force has concluded that Saudi Arabia remains politically stable, but that the United States needs to find new ways to gather intelligence in one of the world's most closed societies. 1 In Washington, Prince Bandar is the voice of Saudi Arabia. 20 The American Defense Secretary met with the Saudi King. 20 THE MYSTERY OF CLUE'S INVENTOR A British law clerk who invented a popular board game died in such obscurity two years ago, it was learned last week, that not even Colonel Mustard or Miss Scarlet had a clue. 1 BRITAIN'S PROMINENT NONCITIZEN Mohamed al-Fayed, the Egyptian-born owner of Harrod's and Punch, can claim to have once saved the pound sterling from virtual collapse -- but Britain will still not have him as a citizen. 3 DOMINICAN SETS NEW COURSE The new President of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez, has embarked on a potentially hazardous course, taking on Congress and a corrupt bureaucracy. 15 YUGOSLAVIA'S NEW POWER BROKER Zoran Djindjic, a telegenic 44-year-old opposition leader, may emerge as the new political power broker in Yugoslavia, but he is considered as calculating as the man he could replace. 18 JUSTICE ARRIVES IN BOSNIA The day after the war crimes tribunal in The Hague handed down its first sentence, there was a feeling in some parts of Bosnia that for some of those killed in the war justice may have at last begun. 18 National 8-16, 20 NEW CHANCES ON CLEAN AIR The Clinton Administration's new proposal to tighten national air quality standards may offer an opportunity for some regions of the country that have struggled for years to bring their cities into compliance with the existing clean-air goals. 1 STORMY SENATE SESSION LOOMS It is unclear whether Trent Lott will succeed as a leader of the Senate, for the 105th Congress poses special problems that may not be easily managed by someone with his experience. 1 CALIFORNIA FIGHT FAR FROM OVER Despite declarations of victory on Election Day by supporters of California's anti-affirmative initiative turned out to be premature, with a court fight over the measure's constitutionality just getting under way. 1 NEW PRICE GAUGE URGED A Congressionally appointed panel is expected to recommend that the Government create a new price gauge that would more accurately reflect inflation. 11 VICTIMS' FAMILIES PRESS FOR TAPES Some family members of Valujet crash victims are pressing to hear the cockpit voice recording, saying that for them, part of grieving is wanting to know every detail, even those that others might find unbearable. 8 PRESERVING BOSTON'S JEWISH PAST Efforts are under way to preserve a relic from the period of Jewish immigration to Boston, between 1880 and 1920, when thousands of families poured into the city's North and West Ends. 8 SPOTLIGHT ON MARIJUANA PROGRAM The passage of voter initiatives in California and Arizona allowing the medical use of marijuana has caused renewed interest in a little-known Government program that supplies marijuana for medicinal purposes to eight people across the country. 11 PROFESSOR TURNS SLEUTH Benjamin Austin is a sleuth on the trail of offenders who may well have committed no crime. It is the crime they deny or minimize that offends him: the Holocaust. 16 FRICTION OVER NEW ARRIVALS Like many other communities across the New York region and the nation, Mount Kisco, an affluent suburban village in Westchester County has been struggling to adapt to an influx of Hispanic immigrants, many of them ill-educated day laborers from impoverished villages in Central America. And now, crackdowns on overcrowded housing in Mount Kisco are being criticized by some as a form of official harassment of immigrants. 20 Metropolitan 47-56 MAYOR REBUFFS FEARS ON TRASH Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said New York City would have little trouble finding places to accept its garbage if it is able to shut the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island by 2001, brushing aside fears that some states might bar the waste in a bit of anti-New York fervor. 47 FRICTION OVER NEW ARRIVALS Like many other communities across the New York region and the nation, Mount Kisco, an affluent suburban village in Westchester County, has been struggling to adapt to an influx of Hispanic immigrants, many of them ill-educated day laborers from impoverished villages in Central America. And now, crackdowns on overcrowded housing in Mount Kisco are being criticized by some as a form of official harassment of immigrants. 47 THE NEED FOR GIVING GROWS As representatives of social service agencies in New York City say pleas for help far outstrip their resources, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund begins its 85th annual appeal. 47 Obituaries 58

VOnce the dirt road passes the big vegetable farms near Landless Corner and becomes the private highway of suicidal chickens and car-chasing cows, the huts take on the personalities of their owners. One thatched roof is so neat that it is fussy, another has a layered look, a third is a mess of slipping straw. It seems an odd place for street children to end up: no streets.

VThey looked like Airborne Express deliverymen and they were even driving one of the company's trucks. But as soon as they had delivered their heavy package to a Brooklyn car repair shop, the two men arrested the worker who had signed for it. These were no deliverymen, and the package was no ordinary delivery. The men were undercover police officers assigned to an effort against drugs in Brooklyn, and the police said that the package, which they had intercepted, was an air compressor stuffed with 75 pounds of marijuana, worth thousands of dollars.

VTWO weeks ago tomorrow, the Friday before the Cowboys were to lose at Giants Stadium, the word was on the street. And three days before the Cowboys were to dominate the Redskins on Thanksgiving, the word was in headlines in The Fort Worth Star-Telegram: Leon Lett had tested positive for drugs. Because of confidentiality clauses, mum was the word in the National Football League and Players Association offices as well as for Lett and his lawyers until Commissioner Paul Tagliabue ruled on the Cowboy defensive tackle's appeal over test collection and processing details.

VThis week, the Supreme Court heard arguments that the Brady law violates states' rights. The law imposes a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases to allow checks of criminal records. While most law enforcement organizations support the law, some county sheriffs oppose a provision that requires them to do the background checks. They object, as Justice Antonin Scalia puts it, that the Brady law ''makes the states dance like marionettes on the fingers of the Federal Government.'' The sheriffs' argument should be rejected. The Brady law asks state and local law enforcement officers to make only reasonable and minimal efforts to aid in insuring that guns stay out of criminal hands. It makes sense to ask local sheriffs to check such things as state arrest records. It's not clear why states' rights advocates think a Federal bureaucracy would be any better. Background checks do not invade states' rights any more than Federal laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to report missing children or traffic fatalities.

VThe rap performer known as Flavor Flav was arrested in the South Bronx early Friday morning when he was found carrying two pounds of marijuana, the police said. The rapper, whose real name is William Drayton, was riding a bicycle past the corner of Grand Concourse and 161st Street when two officers from the Police Department's Street Crime Unit stopped him, said Carmen Melendez, a police spokeswoman. The officers stopped Mr. Drayton, 37, because his pocket was bulging and they thought he was carrying a weapon, she said. Instead, they found he was carrying enough marijuana to be charged with a felony. He was charged with third-degree criminal possession of marijuana and jailed until yesterday, when he pleaded innocent and was released pending a Jan. 15 court date.

VIn 1983, a year after Nicholas L. Bissell Jr. became Somerset County Prosecutor, he filed a lawsuit to remove Franklin Township's Mayor from office. His complaint? Misconduct in office, he said, because she had distributed fliers at a township Council meeting criticizing a police investigation of several rapes. In 1989, William B. Wahl, the director of Somerset County's governing body, the Board of Chosen Freeholders, apparently angered Mr. Bissell by questioning raises for his staff and demanding that the County Auditor audit the Prosecutor's office. Subsequently, Mr. Bissell accused Mr. Wahl of stealing a political campaign sign from a yard and then lying about it.

V''CASH RULES everything around me.'' So goes the refrain to ''C.R.E.A.M.,'' a hit by the rap supergroup Wu-Tang Clan. A haunting fable of ghetto economics, the song depicts a grim world of ''stick-up kids, corrupt cops and crack rocks,'' where ''drug loot'' is the only way for the young black men that haunt its street corners to earn a living. While ''C.R.E.A.M.'' reflects the rough-and-tumble life that the group's members had growing up in housing projects on Staten Island, its money-obsessed chorus takes on new meaning in the wake of Wu-Tang's success. In less than four years, Wu-Tang Clan has evolved into a hugely profitable hip-hop conglomerate that has made the industry rethink how it does business. Wu-Tang has used a brash entrepreneurial approach to build an empire that largely ignores common wisdom regarding contracts, marketing and choosing record companies.

VON a blustery Tuesday last January, Junot Diaz was summoned from his day job to the phone. A year out of graduate school, he made photocopies at Pfizer Pharmaceuticals in Manhattan by day and wrote fiction at night and in the early morning. When he hung up, he cried: ''Yo! Somebody wants to buy my book! I quit!'' That was the beginning of this year of being published and praised.

VJonathan Larson, who created the hit rock opera ''Rent,'' died as he was about to achieve success. Following is an account of the last days of his life and the first days of his production, assembled from the accounts of co-workers (in italic print) and from a New York State Department of Health case report released yesterday. Sunday, Jan. 21, 1996 At the New York Theater Workshop between the Bowery and Second Avenue in the East Village, ''Rent'' is in the final, frantic days of rehearsal before previews begin. In theater terminology, the period is ''10-out-of-12 days,'' when the actors may be kept at work for 10 hours out of a maximum of 12. At the New York Theater Workshop, this is a day when lighting, sound, costumes, props, sets are being integrated into the production.

VAfter arresting more than 70 people in the last month and confiscating assets that included ranches, vehicles and a convenience store, Federal officials say they have broken up one of the largest marijuana distribution rings operating along the Mexican border. Concentrated in Starr County, a remote area along the Rio Grande that is often listed in census records as one of the most impoverished counties in the nation, the ring smuggled more than 100 tons of marijuana across the border over the last decade and sent it on to at least nine states, United States Attorney Gaynelle Griffin Jones said here this week in announcing a 179-count indictment. All but a handful of the 79 people named in the action have been apprehended, she said.

VInternational 3-29 SERBIA FACES ANOTHER CRISIS Serbia's economy, in a tailspin after decades of Communism and nearly four years of sanctions, appears headed for a new crisis. 1 CANADA'S HEALTH CARE PROBLEMS Nothing holds a more sacred place in Canada's values than the country's health care system, and nothing incites more raw emotion than having to come to grips with its limitations. 3 RWANDANS ON THE MOVE AGAIN Tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees set off on foot toward home in a mass movement that could signal an end to their two and a half years in camps in Tanzania. 4 A SIGN OF HOPE IN TURKISH WAR The recently negotiated release of six Turkish soldiers captured by Kurdish rebels appears to reflect the beginning of a change in thinking about a conflict that has seemed likely to drag on forever. 9 PANAMA'S PLANS TO RUN ITS CANAL With the international shipping industry looking on, Panama's Congress has begun drafting the law that will govern the Panama Canal when the United States gives up control three years from now. 16 CHINESE FARMERS' OLD BURDENS China's peasantry is better off today than at any time in modern history.

VAt the peak of a storm last February, several of the nation's most gifted philosophers and political scientists met for a weekend at the Westchester County estate of George Soros, the Hungarian-born billionaire financier. As the wind rattled the windows, Mr. Soros raised a glass in honor of his guests and gave them a challenge: if they were to advise him on how to spend more money each year than the Ford Foundation does on philanthropy, much of it in the United States, what would they suggest? ''It was an astonishing session, as well as the most expensive philosophical tutorial anyone has ever had,'' said Alan Ryan, at the time a professor at Princeton and now the warden of New College at Oxford.

VThe use of illegal drugs by adolescents continued to rise this year, raising fresh questions about the effectiveness of drug prevention programs for schoolchildren. In the latest national survey, released yesterday, 40 percent of high seniors interviewed said they had used illegal drugs in the past year, compared with 39 percent from a survey in 1995. Half said they had tried drugs at some time in their lives and nearly a quarter said they had done so in the past month.

VThree men were charged with murder yesterday in the shooting deaths of an off-duty police officer and a Queens businessman last week. The arrests, which came after one suspect was picked up on a minor drug charge, were hailed by Police Commissioner Howard Safir as an especially gratifying example of how the city's crackdown on ''quality of life'' crimes can lead to major arrests. ''This case was solved based on a minor arrest, which we constantly talk about,'' Mr. Safir said, ''paying attention to small crimes and you solve big crimes. This is a perfect example of it.''

Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, head of the Clinton Administration's anti-drug effort, raised the issue most recently in a meeting here in mid-December. Mexican officials refused to approve the request, but indicated they would engage in further talks on the issue.

A recent comment by Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House director of national drug policy, might give us a hint. He said that, despite parents' own youthful drug peccadillos, their message to youngsters should be ''unambiguous: zero tolerance.''

VHugging an isolated stretch of the Rio Grande along the Mexican border, Starr County has long had a reputation as a haven for smugglers. In past decades, the booty was alcohol or cattle; these days, it is drugs. But even as people here have become accustomed to periodic crackdowns by drug enforcement officials and arrests of local citizens, no one can quite recall a sweep of the magnitude of a recent Federal operation. In all, 79 people were arrested and charged with involvement in a marijuana-smuggling ring that Federal officials describe as a multimillion-dollar enterprise.

VMurder by strangers has declined more than twice as much as murder by acquaintances over four years in New York City, part of a pronounced shift in both the nature and scope of homicide in the city. The city is almost certain to end the year with fewer than 1,000 murders, the lowest level since 1968, newly released police records show.

VVoter initiatives in California and Arizona approving the use of marijuana for medical purposes are spreading alarm among many families and confronting law enforcement officials with a tough dilemma. Although the voters in those two states have clearly spoken, it is impossible for either measure to be carried out without someone violating Federal law. The Clinton Administration thus has little choice but to insist that Federal drug statutes be enforced. That response is not enough, however. Federal authorities need to address concerns that a legitimate treatment for seriously ill patients is being blocked because of broader fears of marijuana abuse. The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration maintains there is no medical evidence that smoking marijuana has ever helped anyone. But it is difficult to dismiss the testimony from many seriously ill patients and their doctors that marijuana can ease pain, reduce the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy, stimulate the appetites of AIDS patients who are wasting away, and lower the pressure within the eyes of glaucoma victims. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a synthetic version of THC, a main ingredient of marijuana, that can help in such cases, but many patients complain that it is a poor substitute and is much more expensive.

VInternational A2-8 PROGRESS SEEN IN PERU CRISIS Diplomats grew optimistic that a hostage crisis in Peru could be resolved without bloodshed after the Government and Marxist rebels met face to face and appeared to soften their positions. A1 RED CROSS AT CENTER OF STANDOFF The senior Red Cross representative in Peru had just arrived, without enough time to unpack his boxes, when he was thrust into the role of mediator in a hostage crisis. A8 PRESSURE ON U.S. TO PAY AT U.N. Having orchestrated the ouster of Boutros Boutros-Ghali as Secretary General, the Clinton Administration is being pressed to pay outstanding United Nations dues. But the Republican Congress is resisting. A1 NO DEAL ON HEBRON Israeli and Palestinian sides failed to seal a deal on Hebron, leaving only two days till a self-imposed target on New Year's Day. A3 NORTH KOREA APOLOGIZES FOR SUB In a sign that it wants to improve relations with the rest of the world, North Korea expressed ''deep regret'' for its submarine infiltration of South Korean waters and promised not to do it again. A1 SOUTH KOREA'S PAINED TRANSITION News analysis: The harsh Government response to labor strikes has underscored the difficulties of the shift to democracy in South Korea, where pluralism is still based less on attitudes than institutions. A6 Striking workers threatened to paralyze Seoul with a mass rally. A6 ARMY SAID TO BACK SERB PROTESTS A letter expressing solidarity with the anti-Government demonstrators and said to be on behalf of an elite unit of the Yugoslav Army was read to cheering crowds at an opposition rally in Serbia. A3 ACCORD ENDS WAR IN GUATEMALA After 36 years of war that left more than 100,000 dead, a grateful but weary Guatemala watched the signing of a truce between the Government and the leftist guerrillas. A8 Camp Ashraf Journal: Iranians in exile, in Iraq. A4 National A9-12 ABANDONING GINGRICH Representative Michael P. Forbes, a Republican from Long Island who was once among the strongest supporters of Speaker Newt Gingrich, now says he will not vote to re-elect the Speaker. A1 THE PORTLAND EXPERIMENT Special Report: While some Western boom cities like Phoenix and Denver have seen largely uncontrolled growth, Portland, Ore., has prospered with strict laws against urban sprawl. A1 WRANGLING OVER WRESTLING The Texas Wrestling Officials Association has disbanded to avoid being ordered to provide referees for school wrestling matches in which girls compete against boys. The group faces a suit brought by two mothers and their daughters. A9 POLICE UNDER SUSPICION On Chicago's West Side, seven police officers have been arrested, and the community is wondering where to place its trust. A9 LANGUAGE AND RACE Poor performance by black students led the school board in Oakland, Calif., to adopt a resolution recognizing the idiosyncratic speech of many black children, and the resulting debate has spread nationwide. A9 CHAFF IN A FUND-RAISER'S FILES The files of John Huang, the former Democratic fund-raiser, contain plenty that is politically explosive, but also plenty that is just plain ridiculous. A11 SOCIAL SECURITY STRATEGIES There is a broad consensus that the Social Security system needs reform, but little agreement on what should be done, and numerous organizations want a part in the debate on the issue. A10 Metro Report B1-6 LILCO MERGER APPROVED In a deal with far-reaching political and financial implications, Brooklyn Union Gas and the Long Island Lighting Company agreed yesterday to a historic merger that would create a strong new utility and perhaps lead eventually to deep cuts in Long Island's electric rates.

VTwo young women, lifelong friends who vanished early Friday after leaving a nightclub in Jamaica, Queens, were found yesterday morning locked inside a storefront about half a mile away. One had been badly beaten and the other had apparently been bludgeoned to death. The discovery was made by the members of a social club who recognized the women's pictures from the television news Saturday evening and went to look for them in the store next door, Mama's Mini Mart at 109-10 Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, where they remembered having seen the women on Friday morning.

Voters in those two states approved propositions in November that relax restrictions on the medical use of some illegal drugs. But the Federal Government, uneasy with the measures, has been developing a strategy to counter them.

VAn article on Dec. 17 about charitable giving by the financier George Soros referred incompletely to the financing of ballot initiatives in Arizona and California to permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes. While Mr. Soros was the initiatives' single largest donor, with gifts of more than $1 million, another donor, Peter Lewis, also played a major role, giving more than $800,000.

VIF the Dallas Cowboys were really America's Team as they like to proclaim, their owner, Jerry Jones, would suspend Michael Irvin now. If only because, with so much smoke, the flames can't be far away. According to the Dallas police, an unidentified 23-year-old woman has complained that Irvin held a gun to her head Sunday night while his teammate, Erik Williams, and an unidentified man raped her in Williams's home.

VA driver crashed a bus into an apartment building here yesterday after he was attacked by a passenger, the police said. Sgt. Wally Wolfe said the driver was attacked after he stopped the Greenville-Lafayette bus traveling southbound on Ocean Avenue shortly before 8 P.M. He said the driver had stopped the bus to ask a male passenger to either turn down his radio or to stop smoking marijuana. Shortly after that, Sergeant Wolfe said, the driver was hit over the head with a pipe or the radio. He lost consciousness and the bus mounted the sidewalk and crashed into the three-story building at Ocean and Stegman Avenues. The driver was taken to Jersey City Medical Center, treated for head injuries and released. Sergeant Wolfe said no passengers were seriously hurt. The police arrested Damian Tyner, 22, of Jersey City.

VTo the Editor: Re ''Doctors Given Federal Threat on Marijuana'' (front page, Dec. 31): Apparently California's Proposition 215, which legalizes marijuana for medical use, wasn't so badly written after all. As its drafters knew, if doctors wrote a prescription for marijuana they would be subject to Federal punishment -- regardless of California law. That is why the proposition requires only a verbal or written recommendation from a doctor, not a prescription.

But a report published by the National Institute on Drug Abuse shows that the average potency of marijuana has not increased in more than a decade. Marijuana's potency is measured as the percentage of dry weight of Delta-9-THC in a sample. Delta-9-THC is the principal psychoactive ingredient of the marijuana plant.

VEVER since Ronald Reagan's ''new federalism'' revived the debate over states' rights in the 1980's -- and particularly since Republicans took control of Congress in 1994 -- power has seemed to be ebbing from Washington. Last year, the Federal Government gave up its six-decade responsibility for welfare. California, like other states, has moved to assert its authority in other areas, voting to sidestep the Federal commitment to affirmative action and Federal drug laws on marijuana. The trend may be unmistakable, but devolution, it turns out, isn't revolution. And it isn't easy, as advocates of states' rights, particularly in the West, are learning -- the hard way. They have been angered at recent assertions of authority by the Clinton Administration and the Federal judiciary.

VONE of the most ignominious chapters in American foreign policy came to a close last week with the signing of an armistice halting a 36-year-long civil war here that the Central Intelligence Agency both originated and sustained. But even as Guatemalans were celebrating the end of their national tragedy, the Drug Enforcement Administration was apparently standing ready to recruit their country's leaders in yet another American-inspired campaign. Barely released from their inherited enlistment in Washington's anti-Communist crusade, Guatemalan officials say they are now being pressed to play a more active role in the United States' war on narcotics. For his part, President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen, seems willing to go along. He is, after all, in need of new tasks to keep Guatemala's armed forces out of mischief now that they are no longer allowed to kill leftist guerrillas or their suspected sympathizers. Fighting Drugs

VWhy are Americans so cynical about government these days? Scholars and commentators deplore the phenomenon, but sometimes the public has reasons for its feeling. Consider what has just happened on the issue of marijuana use for medical purposes. The voters of California and Arizona, by large margins, approved ballot initiatives to let doctors recommend marijuana for pain relief and other medical purposes. The Clinton Administration's response, announced last week, was to say that the referendums would be overriden by the Federal policy on marijuana: total prohibition of its possession or use for any purpose.

VTo the Editor: Anthony Lewis, who in his Jan. 6 column writes about voter initiatives approving medical use of marijuana, might be interested to know that my father, Francis L. Young, who was an administrative law judge for the Drug Enforcement Administration, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma within four months of retiring in 1990. This was within two years of handing down an opinion on the medical use of marijuana that said, in part: ''Marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision. It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for D.E.A. to continue to stand between sufferers and the benefits of this substance.''

VNEW YORK Adirondack Land for Sale A century after William C. Whitney bought a vast retreat deep in the Adirondacks, his family, headed now by Marylou Whitney, has proposed to subdivide and sell more than a third of the remaining 51,000 acres. The proposal drew protests from environmental and recreation groups, which had sought since 1990 to have the entire Whitney estate bought by New York State, Governor Pataki said the proposal was a welcome sign that the land was up for sale, adding that the state would aggressively vie for it. $(Page A1.$)

VThe assignment I gave Simon, a 12-year-old part-time journalist and full-time Knicks fanatic, was to count how often beer was plugged during the course of a single game on TV. The tally kept mounting until finally he wrote on his pad: ''More combined beer commercials and signs in the game than the Clippers scored in the first quarter!'' A few days later, ever vigilant for a scoop, he reported seeing a new beverage ad on another Knicks broadcast. ''C-H-I-V-A-S Regal,'' Simon declaimed, demonstrating that ''Sesame Street'' has no monopoly on teaching kids how to spell.

VFrank Rich Op-Ed column on the double standard America applies to alcoholic beverages and to drugs, which he says is not lost on young people; says that since beer, wine and liquor are not about to be consigned to same status as marijuana, the most plausible alternative for reducing teen-age drug use may be to give marijuana the same status as alcohol (M)

VTOM KELLY doesn't like Mondays. By 8 A.M. tomorrow, Mr. Kelly will find at least two dozen telephone messages from gamblers and hotel guests who assume that he has nothing better to do than help them look for missing clothing, canes, credit cards, dentures, marriage licenses, medicine, jewelry, knives, keys, automobiles, bicycles, wheelchairs and even large amounts of cash. Assisting in morning-after hunts for missing items is not Mr. Kelly's job as the full-time manager of the Tropicana Casino Hotel's lost-and-found department. A 15-year employee of the Tropicana's security staff, Mr. Kelly rarely leaves his drab, cramped, two-room office, where it typically takes him until mid-afternoon on Mondays just to return phone calls and fill out the paperwork on the items reported lost or stolen over the weekend. Then he has to deal with what maids, slot machine attendants and the occasional good Samaritan have turned in.

VThe Relic Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore Directed by Peter Hyams R 110 minutes An evolutionary biologist (Ms. Miller), working at the Chicago Museum of Natural History (actually the Field Museum), stumbles upon a strange leaf in a shipment of relics from Brazil. (Never mind that the ship the relics were to arrive on is hauled into port with its crew dead and decapitated.) The next thing you know, a guard is, yes, decapitated, and a police lieutenant (Mr. Sizemore) is called in to find the killer. More decapitations follow, and a pattern turns up: the hypothalamus is always missing. And just as the museum has scheduled a big fund-raising event for its superstitions exhibit, an overgrown, hormone-boosted, giant gecko monster starts roaming the basement. VIOLENCE Those decapitations, claw marks, body parts, an autopsy. SEX Not with all those decapitations going on. PROFANITY The usual sort. FOOTNOTE A guard smokes marijuana just before being decapitated. For Which Children? AGES 12 and up They may have read the popular book. They may want to go. But this movie is full of intense moments and may be too much for impressionable teen-agers. LINDA LEE

VMessage to Love: The Isle Of Wight Festival At Film Forum in Manhattan Rock artists, promoters, agents, 600,000 fans Directed by Murray Lerner No rating 128 minutes It's 1970 in England, and ''the last great outdoor rock festival'' is being held on the Isle of Wight. Featuring Jimi Hendrix, the Who, the Doors, the Moody Blues, Kris Kristofferson, Joni Mitchell and many others, the festival turns ugly as cash-starved promoters and penceless hippies argue about the admission fee. Less a celebration of love than an evocation of the past, the film has swell music and features Mr. Hendrix and Jim Morrison of the Doors in their last public appearances. VIOLENCE Police patrol the fences with vicious dogs, but no one is hurt. SEX Two frontal shots of female nudity. PROFANITY We're talking rock stars here; obscenities flow on stage and off. FOOTNOTE The musicians exhort the fans to smoke marijuana, and they do. For Which Children? UNDER 10 They may like the music and the spectacle, but the language is rough. AGES 11 and up They'll probably enjoy seeing the stars of old and the hippies. Parents should be aware of the casual drug use. SUZANNE O'CONNOR

VA group of doctors and patients advocating the medical use of marijuana sued senior officials of the Clinton Administration today to try to block the Government from sanctions on doctors who recommend the drug to sick people under a new California law. The class-action lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court here, asserts that the Administration's plan to prosecute or strip prescription licenses from doctors who endorse the drug for patients with illnesses like cancer and AIDS intrudes on the doctor-patient relationship in violation of the First Amendment.

VTo the Editor: Frank Rich, in ''Drug War on the Rocks'' (column, Jan. 11), argues that young people receive contradictory messages from a society that outlaws marijuana but promotes greater consumption of alcohol and tobacco through advertising. That may be true, but his conclusion that the ''most plausible alternative for reducing teen-age drug use'' is to treat marijuana like alcohol, namely to legalize marijuana and regulate its sale, is open to question.

VCLINTON IS AT MIDCOURSE. WILL THERE BE A MIDCOURSE CORRECTION? A thing must first have a shape for the shape to be correctable. How does one ''correct'' a chaos? In last fall's election, though Clinton won 49 percent of the vote, according to a Time/CNN poll only 14 percent of those voting said they agreed with his positions -- and one wonders how even those few divined what those positions are. In the last half of his first term, Clinton's pliability was traced to Dick Morris, who called his strategy ''triangulation,'' a metaphor from sailing, where you tack with the wind given you, deviating from a course in order to angle back toward it. But Clinton needed no lessons in shiftiness. How do you teach a cat to twist as it falls? I am haunted by a story Lew Manilow told me. Manilow is a Clinton friend and financial backer. ''Joe Klein came up to me and poked his finger in my chest'' -- Manilow pointed his own finger at his chest, then lowered it to his belly button. (''Joe is even shorter than I am.'') Klein said: ''He turned on me, Lew. And he'll turn on you, too. Just wait and see.'' Klein had been de-Flowered, an ideological Gennifer. But while Flowers took her grievance to a tabloid for peanuts, Klein took his to Random House for millions.

VAn 18-year-old who went into a coma 10 days ago at a police station where he was being booked on charges stemming from a Bronx stabbing died yesterday morning, the police said. Officials said the man, Richard Thomas, had heroin, marijuana, a tranquilizer and alcohol in his system when he slipped into a coma on Jan. 11 at the 40th Precinct station house. He died at Lincoln Hospital, where he had been on a respirator ever since, said a police spokeswoman, Officer Noreen Murray.

VThe Food and Drug Administration issued two rulings today that have little in common except the certainty that they will have an impact in many American homes. One ruling affects the labels on cereal boxes, and the other will allow parents to test their children for drug use. The first ruling gives the makers of oatmeal and other oat-based cereals permission, effective immediately, to claim on their package labels that the cereals are good for the human heart -- up to a point.

VAFTER the enthusiastic reviews for Cameron Stracher's first novel, ''The Laws of Return,'' most neophyte writers would be doodling dollar signs with unmitigated glee. According to Publishers Weekly, the book, published in November by William Morrow and Company, is ''fiercely honest, caustically funny . . . first-class social comedy.'' Library Journal called it an ''impressive debut novel'' and ''a delightful tale.'' Time Out New York said, ''This bracing and ultimately moving novel marks the arrival of a strong new comic writer, one who rescues both lawyers and Long Island from terminal unfunniness.''

VINTERNATIONAL A3-11 Hamas Official Warns U.S. Not to Extradite Leader A top Hamas official in Gaza warned of possible retaliation against the United States if it extradites Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook to Israel. Mr. Abu Marzook has acknowledged heading the militant Islamic organization's political wing. ''Israel will gain nothing from more prisoners, and America will gain nothing by gaining a new enemy -- Hamas,'' the official said. Mr. Abu Marzook has denied any role in Hamas's military actions. A3 Vichy Figure Lashes Out Maurice Papon, a former French official ordered to stand trial on charges of crimes against humanity for deporting Jews to Nazi camps between 1942 and 1944, accused French Jews of helping to organize the deportations. He asserted that Jewish leaders in charge of administrating transit camps in France had, albeit under threat, selected which Jews were to be sent to death camps in Germany. He denied any guilt and blamed foreign forces in New York for orchestrating a campaign against himself and France. A5 Court Upholds Bhutto Dismissal Pakistan's highest court upheld President Farooq Leghari's dismissal of the Government of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto for corruption last November. The judges ruled that there was ample proof of corruption as well as evidence the government sanctioned killings of political opponents. A3 Peru and Japan to Confer President Alberto Fujimori of Peru agreed to meet with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan in Toronto this weekend to discuss the hostage crisis in Lima, now entering its sixth week. Mr. Hashimoto is known to be concerned that aggressive maneuvers by Peruvian security forces outside the residence of the Japanese Ambassador could jeopardize the lives of 72 hostages being held inside by leftist rebels. A11 Bulgarian Socialists Ask to Talk Bulgaria's governing Socialists, facing widening street protests and a collapsing economy, appealed for talks with opposition parties to set a date for early elections. The Socialists have overseen a caretaker Government since the Prime Minister resigned in December after his party lost the presidential election. The opposition said it would talk only if the Socialists gave up their efforts to form a new government. A4 For Some Albanians, Cash Back The poorest Albanians will get immediate cash payments from the frozen assets of failing get-rich-quick schemes, President Sali Berisha said. Others will receive account statements proving they put money into the pyramid schemes. The schemes were declared illegal this month after their failure to make payments set off unrest. It was unclear how many people would be reimbursed in cash, opening the way for more confusion and possible rioting from investors who fear their money could be lost for good. (AP) NATIONAL A12-16, B6-7 Sketch of Suspect In Bombing Is Identified The man whose sketch was distributed widely in connection with the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City has been identified as an Army private who had no role in the case. The identification was made by the mechanic from Junction City, Kan., whose description formed the basis for the sketch. A1 Hispanic Income Drops While the median household income for every other ethnic and racial group was rising, that for Hispanic families was falling, the latest Census Bureau statistics show. A1 Companies Object to Gift Ban Some international companies are objecting to the Democratic National Committee's decision to bar contributions from United States-based corporations with a foreign-owned parent. Companies as diverse -- and as large -- as Philips Electronics, Shell Oil Company, ICI Americas and Glaxo Wellcome have joined together to lobby against the ban. A Pennsylvania subsidiary of a French company that gave the Democrats $15,000 to attend a fund-raising dinner with President Clinton was called the day before the dinner and asked not to come; the company asked for its money back. B6 More Airline Safety Information The Federal Aviation Administration plans to make information available on airline safety and accidents on the World Wide Web next month. The statistics are now available only through the Freedom of Information Act. The agency warns that the information will not help in ranking the airlines for safety. B6 Top Military Leader to Retire The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, will retire in September, the White House announced. General Shalikashvili is following the lead of others who have served two two-year terms in the post. B7 Cuomo Confirmed to Lead HUD Andrew Cuomo, the son of the former New York Governor, was confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. He had spent three years as an assistant housing secretary. The Senate Commerce Committee recommended approval of William M. Daley as Commerce Secretary. (AP) Home Cancer Test Is Urged In an effort to fight the nation's second leading cancer killer, the American Gastroenterological Association issued new guidelines that call for a home test for colorectal cancer. If people use the tests every year after age 50, deaths from the disease could be cut by about a third, an effectiveness rate similar to that for mammograms against breast cancer. B7 Support for Medical Marijuana In an editorial, The New England Journal of Medicine called for allowing doctors to prescribe marijuana for medical purposes. (AP) NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Giuliani's Budget to Include Cut in Tax on Clothing Mayor Giuliani said he planned to seek $250 million in tax cuts, including eliminating the city's share of the sales tax on clothing under $500, in his preliminary budget. A1 Whitman Plans More Spending Governor Whitman proposed a $16.4 billion election-year budget for New Jersey that provides spending increases for public schools, prisons and the environment, and more than a dozen modest initiatives aimed at Democratic and swing voters. B1 Dinkins Toys With a Rematch Former Mayor David N. Dinkins said he was considering ending his political retirement and challenging Mayor Giuliani in this year's election. Some of his oldest advisers were surprised by his comments and skeptical that he would run. A1 M.T.A. Buying Cleaner Buses Transit officials said they would buy 500 new buses that run on compressed natural gas and electricity, representing about 15 percent of the city's fleet. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has long been planning to convert the fleet to run on cleaner fuels, but the announcement marked the first commitment to buy the new buses. B3 Dan Rather's Mystery: Solved The man who attacked Dan Rather in 1986 saying ''Kenneth, what is the frequency?'' appears to be the same person who shot an NBC stagehand to death outside Rockefeller Center in 1994, the authorities said.

VThe director of the National Institutes of Health plans to convene a conference in February to help resolve ''the public health dilemma'' raised by state referendums on the issue of permitting the use of marijuana for medical purposes. The conference is being organized by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to investigate the question of whether marijuana is an effective and appropriate medication, the Director, Dr. Harold Varmus, said in an interview yesterday. The speakers at the Feb. 19 and 20 conference have yet to be arranged but, as Dr. Varmus described it, the meeting at the National Institutes in Bethesda, Md., will be open to anyone.

VThe New England Journal of Medicine endorsed the medical use of marijuana this week, thus increasing the pressure on the Clinton Administration to accelerate a fair and reasoned re-examination of the drug's medical properties. When a leading medical journal finds therapeutic value in marijuana, it may be hard for drug officials to continue blocking medical uses pending conclusive clinical studies showing marijuana to be beneficial. The journal acknowledges that marijuana use may cause long-term adverse effects and lead to serious addiction. But it argues that these distant risks are not relevant issues when the drug is prescribed to combat intractable nausea and pain in seriously ill patients with AIDS, cancer and other diseases. It does not make sense to prohibit physicians from prescribing marijuana when they are allowed to prescribe morphine and meperidine, wrong dosages of which may hasten death, and when there is no risk of immediate death with marijuana. While a synthetic form of a key ingredient of marijuana is available by prescription, the journal said, smoking marijuana provides rapid and more effective relief.

VYoung adults who used illegal drugs or alcohol as teen-agers tend to cut down or quit when confronted by the responsibilities of marriage and family. But divorce can drive them back to their old habits, according to a new study. The study, compiled by five researchers at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, documents what many parents and their rebellious children have learned -- that substance abuse goes up when adolescents break free of parental restraints but then goes down once they mature and accept new responsibilities of love and marriage.

VNow in its third season on CBS, ''Chicago Hope,'' created by David E. Kelley (''Picket Fences''), got off to one of the more memorably unfortunate starts in prime time. Suddenly there were two new major hospital shows, and two major networks, with typically shaky programming wisdom, decided to compete head-to-head on Thursday nights. NBC's ''E. R.,'' more finely attuned to blood, guts and sex, quickly ran off with the reviews and ratings. It still does. All seemed lost for ''Chicago Hope,'' which, while not an instant grabber, simmered with potential. Rolling the dice, CBS moved the show to Monday night. The concept and plots were tightened. New faces were added to the cast, most notably Christine Lahti as Kathryn Austin, a cardiothoracic surgeon with a reform-minded steeliness to match her mouth-filling title. Viewers stayed tuned. More changes were gradually made. Like ''M*A*S*H'' and ''Cheers,'' ''Chicago Hope'' needed time to find its stride. Judging by current episodes, the series may have found it.

VAfter Carlos Camilo was arrested in the Bronx on a charge of selling marijuana, the authorities say, he skipped his court date and fled to Albuquerque, N.M., figuring he was safely out of the reach of the New York City Police Department. But he was low on money, so it came as a welcome surprise two weeks ago when he got an official-looking letter from something called the State of New York Division of Abandoned and Unclaimed Funds informing him that a windfall of $6,000 awaited him in its Bronx office. He hopped on a bus, rode 2,025 miles to the Bronx and went to the division's office for his check. He was disappointed. On the check's lower left-hand corner was a copy of the familiar Monopoly card: ''Go Directly to Jail. Do not pass go, do not collect $200.'' Mr. Camilo was searched, handcuffed and sent to a nearby Bronx precinct station house for booking. He did not collect any money.

VA small-time rap music promoter surrendered to the police this afternoon and was charged here with hiring two men to bomb a county court building and a police evidence room, in an apparent attempt to block his pending trial in a drug case that could have brought him a life prison term under California's three-strikes sentencing law. The promoter, Kevin L. Robinson, 29, had been the subject of a wide police search since Sunday, when the authorities arrested the two men who they said had planted three bombs in this working-class San Francisco suburb late last month.

VIn the last seven years, this city's flamboyant Police Chief, Nicholas Pastore, became a national figure in law enforcement circles as he transformed an iron-fisted Police Department into a friendly force that tried to win the hearts of neighborhood residents. He was a leading proponent of community policing, an approach adopted by departments across the nation. ''I'm not a cop's cop,'' Mr. Pastore said in 1991, a year after taking the job. ''I'm a people's cop.''

VHoping to step up its fight against drug trafficking, the United States instead finds itself stuck in a messy dispute with Jamaica that threatens to undermine anti-drug efforts throughout the Caribbean. The quarrel centers on Washington's attempt to negotiate an agreement that would let American ships operate in Jamaican waters. Nearly a dozen other Caribbean countries recently signed such accords, which typically allow the United States Coast Guard and Navy to penetrate a country's 12-mile territorial limit to pursue ships believed to be carrying drugs.

VIT WAS 30 YEARS AGO NEXT DECEMBER that the world first chortled at the scene in ''The Graduate'' in which a smug Los Angeles businessman takes aside the baby-faced Dustin Hoffman and declares, ''I just want to say one word to you -- just one word -- 'plastics.' '' ''The Graduate'' didn't invent the use of the word plastic to signify everything phony and superficial in American life. It merely sealed it in, well, celluloid. To sneer at all things plastic was to offer an instant definition of oneself as among the young, hip, truth-seeking cognoscenti locked in a moral power struggle with an older generation of square, corrupt, greedy, warmongering materialists. More than any other touch, its ridicule of plastic defined ''The Graduate'' as a film about the 60's generation gap.

VWe who have just finished serving on our county grand jury are adamant on one point: the secrecy of our proceedings is near-sacred. Only we are supposed to know what went on inside the Middlesex County Grand Jury room during our 18 weeks of service, a fact drilled into us ad nauseam by a judge and assorted prosecutors. So seriously do we grand jurors take this secrecy requirement that we are going to have to ask you to stop reading this article right now. Violators will be indicted. We admit that a ripple of pride went through us when we received our grand jury summons lo those many months ago. Having paid at least passing attention to the news in the last few decades -- Watergate, Abscam, Whitewater -- we knew that a grand jury was a fearsome thing, a mysterious yet powerful entity not unlike Superman, called in whenever the forces of evil threatened to get out of hand.

VBUNDLED up in oversized ski jackets, the 17 teen-agers strolled into the small room at St. Martin of Tours Roman Catholic Church, plopping down on folding metal chairs lined against turquoise walls. Some carried boom boxes. The bounce of a basketball against the linoleum floor reverberated through the air. It was Friday night and these teen-agers had come to rap with the neighborhood priest. Running his fingers through his tousled hair, the Rev. John Flynn sat at a desk, sprawled with papers, in the middle of the room, leading a discussion that jumped from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to police harassment to racism with the speed and energy of a race car. In this neighborhood in the East Tremont section of the central Bronx, where drugs and poverty threaten to drain existence itself, Father Flynn plays a pivotal force in preserving the pieces.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-15 Soccer Ball Makers Rule Child Labor Out of Bounds Major sporting goods companies have promised to combat the sale of soccer balls made by the thousands of children in Pakistan who are paid an average of 60 cents for each ball they stitch. The program is the first of its kind to include all the major competitors in an industry. It will seek to put the children in school and to help their families make up for the lost income. A12 Clinton and Netanyahu Meet President Clinton met with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in the White House, and praised him for his commitment to the peace process begun by his predecessors. They also discussed the prospects for resuming talks between Syria and Israel. A6 Politicians Arrested in Seoul South Korea's Home Minister, Kim Woo Suk, was arrested along with two other prominent politicians on charges of accepting bribes from the founder of Hanbo Steel, which collapsed earlier this year under $6 billion in debt. Televised news reports said prosecutors did not intend to summon any further politicians for questioning in the scandal, which has reached into circles close to President Kim Young Sam. A8 Chinese Face Defector Issue Chinese troops and security officers surrounded the South Korean Embassy in Beijing, where a top North Korean official was reported to be seeking asylum. The defection was a nightmare for China, which has links to both Koreas. It urged calm, and its foreign minister was to meet his South Korean counterpart today. A9 Tajiks Said to Kill Hostage Tajik rebels who were holding 14 hostages killed one of them, a United Nations observer, Russian news organizations reported. The United Nations warned that the report might be a ruse. Warlords in the Central Asian nation have increasingly resorted to hostage-taking; the group holding these hostages wants to free comrades in Afghanistan. A11 Kazakstan Seizes Uranium Several people were arrested in Kazakstan for trying to sell 2.2 pounds of radioactive uranium, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The would-be vendors were residents of the northeastern town of Semipalatinsk, once the Soviet Union's main nuclear testing ground. The report did not say whether the uranium was highly enriched and therefore usable for weapons. (AP) Ethiopia Charges Ex-Officials Ethiopia charged over 5,000 officials of the deposed military junta with crimes ranging from genocide to willful injury. More than 2,000 of those named are already in detention; some had been held without charges for nearly six years. Among those charged were the former Marxist dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, in exile in Zimbabwe, and the former Olympic marathon champion Mamo Wolde. A6 NATIONAL A16-30 Split Vote in House On Family-Planning Funds The House approved a measure to speed up the release of money for family-planning programs overseas. It also voted separately to reinstate Reagan-era restrictions preventing such money from being distributed to groups that perform or promote abortions. A1 Budget Is Called Unbalanced The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said President Clinton's budget plan would leave the Federal Government with a deficit of at least $49 billion in 2002. The White House had projected a $17 billion surplus that year. A30 Inquiry About Chinese Money Officials said the F.B.I. was investigating whether Chinese officials or their agents may have used people close to President Clinton to secretly donate campaign money to the Democratic Party over the past five years. A21 Shuttle Reels In Telescope The crew of the space shuttle Discovery hauled the Hubble Space Telescope aboard, and two astronauts climbed out into the open cargo bay on the first of four spacewalks to begin what is being called a one-billion-mile tuneup of the telescope. A25 President Defends Nominee During a White House press conference, President Clinton urged the Senate to act on the nomination of Anthony Lake to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Clinton brought the issue up himself, saying Mr. Lake, his national security adviser in his first term, was ''superbly qualified.'' Opponents have raised questions about Mr. Lake's actions on Bosnia and his stock dealings. A29 Ads Planned Against Drugs The Clinton Administration is planning a prime time advertising campaign to persuade teen-agers not to experiment with marijuana as part of its $313 million effort to educate youths against drugs. A27 New Rules for Surprised Pilots Air Force pilots will be told to check with air traffic controllers if they detect unexpected airplanes on their radar, rather than fly close for a visual identification. An F-16 pilot who tried the visual option last week off New Jersey caused a civilian passenger jet to dive and climb steeply to avoid a collision. A26 King Family Appeals for Trial Relatives of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. made a public appeal for a new trial for the man convicted of Dr. King's assassination. The man, James Earl Ray, confessed to killing Dr. King but later disowned that confession and has long been seeking a new trial. A16 Espy Prosecutor Loses Case The special prosecutor investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy suffered a setback: a jury acquitted two former executives of a crop-insurance company of making illegal campaign contributions to Mr. Espy's brother, who was seeking Mr. Espy's old House seat. A29 NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 Connecticut Budget Plan Cuts Taxes and Trains Gov. John G. Rowland proposed a two-year budget that would substantially cut Connecticut's income tax and reduce the state's work force by about 10 percent. It would also cut the nation's highest gasoline tax by a nickel, paying for the cut partly by closing three commuter rail lines. A1 Giuliani Wants to Ban Lobbying Mayor Giuliani said he wanted to prohibit all lobbying of city agencies. He said his administration was so accessible and fair that there was no need for anyone to hire lobbyists. But he conceded that he did not know how his impromptu idea would work. B1 Efforts on Abuse Faulted Advocates for battered women said Mayor Giuliani's efforts to help battered spouses had been undercut by his failure to spend enough money on them. Shelter space has increased, but so has the demand, partly because of a public awareness campaign by the city, they said. B1 Old Adelphi Trustees Surrender The 18 trustees of Adelphi University who were ousted by the State Board of Regents gave up their fight to remain in office. They said prolonged appeals over their removal could have endangered the university. B2 SPORTS B8-15 It's Spring Training Time The opening of spring training approached with the Yankees facing a dispute at second base and the Mets' manager urging Bill Pulsipher, Jason Isringhausen and Paul Wilson not to rush back from injuries.

VIn a new effort to stem the spiraling rise of illegal drug use by adolescents, the Clinton Administration wants to spend $175 million on a national advertising campaign that would seek to dissuade teen-agers from experimenting with marijuana and other drugs. The plan, included in the Administration's budget proposal sent to Congress last week, calls for financing anti-drug commercials on prime-time television, though other advertisements on radio and in print would be included. The appropriation, which Congress has yet to approve, amounts to little more than 1 percent of a $16 billion Federal budget for fighting drugs in the 1998 fiscal year. The advertising campaign is part of an additional $313 million that has been requested to educate youths against drugs.

VSOME ACTORS AND DIRECTORS seem to have a special chemistry at least as compelling as the on-screen rapport of certain famous acting duos: think of Billy Wilder directing Jack Lemmon or Sydney Pollack directing Robert Redford. One of the most rewarding and long-lasting of these actor-director collaborations has been that of Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson. They have been working together for close to 30 years and recently teamed for a sixth time for ''Blood and Wine,'' a crime story about a jewel heist that goes awry.

VIT is a deliciously sunny Saturday morning at the peak of the tourist season, and at Heritage Quay here, hundreds of passengers are being disgorged from a pair of towering cruise ships into shops and restaurants with names like Smoke & Booze or Rasta Pasta. As a band serenades the visitors with a reggae version of ''Mr. Bojangles,'' a middle-aged American suddenly begins to dance with a T-shirt vendor. ''Did we mention that this is paradise?'' asks one of the brochures handed to arriving tourists. Or so it seems to outsiders. Yet this is also the place that the novelist Jamaica Kincaid, who grew up here, describes as a ''monument to rottenness,'' an island nation barely the size of Queens that has been dominated for half a century by a single family whose doddering patriarch ''perhaps by now thinks that the government is his own business.'' And what about that mysterious electronic listening post, bristling with antennas, radar and satellite dishes, that the American military operates just across from the airport where the charter flights from Chicago and Manchester land?

VDespite strong opposition from Gov. Howard Dean, most Vermonters favor legalizing hemp as an industrial crop, according to a University of Vermont study. The study, conducted last year in response to a mandate from the Vermont Legislature, also found that a large number of Vermonters would buy products made with hemp. Hemp is a low potency, fibrous variety of Cannabis sativa, the species from which the flowers and leaves are harvested as marijuana. But it can also be used in fabrics, paints, edible and inedible oils, and for a variety of other uses.

VWhen Congress eliminated import duties on freshly cut flowers and many other products from some South American countries in 1991, it hoped to encourage farmers in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru to switch from illegal drug production to legitimate crops. Thanks to the Andean Trade Preferences Act, carnations, roses, chrysanthemums and other flowers have become Colombia's third-largest legal export, after oil and coffee. Of $475 million in Colombian flowers exported last year, more than $371 million were sent duty-free to the United States.

VFans came to mosh for the Airwalk Sno-Core tour, a sextuple bill of high-volume, high-impact, high-testosterone bands at Roseland on Wednesday night. The package tour, featuring Face to Face, the Pharcyde, Voodoo Glow Skulls and Less Than Jake, didn't count on this week's warm weather; on most stops, it is to present snowboarding events by day at mountain resorts along with concerts. Sports videos were shown between sets. What advertisers call ''life style marketing'' has found an unlikely tool among hard-touring post-punk bands, whose music promises some of the same thrills as skateboarding and stunt bicycling. At Roseland, marketers were determined to link the muscle of the music and the cachet of daredevil sports to Airwalk shoes, Sony video games and Rolling Stone magazine. Presumably, while flipping pages or pushing game buttons, fans would see themselves working up a virtual sweat.

Mr. Zedillo's decision in December to name Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo to head the federal drug agency capped a series of measures that broke longstanding tradition to draw the Mexican military into all phases of the drug war.

VINTERNATIONAL 3-15 First Cloning of Mammal Reported By Researchers Researchers in Britain announced that they had successfully cloned an adult mammal for the first time, creating a lamb using the DNA of an adult sheep. In theory, researchers said, the same technique could be used to take a cell from an adult human to create a genetically identical human. That prospect raises thorny ethical and philosophical questions. 1 Mexican Governors' Drug Links The Governor of the Mexican state that borders Arizona is working with a powerful drug trafficker, creating a haven for smugglers who send vast quantities of narcotics into the United States, according to American officials and intelligence. And the name of another Mexican Governor is on a United States list of prominent Mexicans suspected of corruption linked to drugs. 1

VThe day before the election last November, Larry Nichols met me at Gibson's 286 Family Restaurant in Conway, Ark., a half hour from Little Rock, and after a lunch topped off with chocolate pie, drove with me in his mother's gold Mercury Marquis to a ranch house on the south side of town. Nichols is a pale, slightly doughy man of 46, and he wore a blue Adidas track suit and chain-smoked Trues. Tuning the oversize television in the living room to CNN, he sat down in a recliner with a view of the front door and a handgun at his side. ''They may just kill me,'' he said. ''You'll read one day that I got drunk and ran into a moving bridge. Or Larry Nichols got depressed over everything and blew his head off.'' Larry Nichols was performing for me now, as he has performed for any number of journalists since Bill Clinton first announced he was running for President more than five years ago. ''They'' in Nichols's universe are shadowy Arkansas characters who have one way or another been connected politically to Clinton. Nichols himself was once a Clinton man. As Governor, Clinton hired him to be the marketing director for the Arkansas Development Finance Authority. Clinton later fired Nichols, charging that he had made unauthorized phone calls to Central America. Nichols, for his part, became convinced that Bill Clinton himself had some vague but sinister Central American connection during the time he was Governor.

ssVabstract

VPhilip Weiss article about fanatical 'Clinton crazies' who spend their lives hating the President; crazies include Arkansans like Larry Nichols and Gary Parks, who have developed monstrous view of Clinton as Satan's nephew and see themselves as martyrs; others are conservative and/or conspiratorial reporters like Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of London Sunday Telegraph, who portray Clinton as figurehead for corrupt political organization; others are freelance obsessives, for whom Internet was invented, who see high moral drama in Clinton scandals; prominent here are Hugh H Sprunt and Chris Ruddy, who devote themselves to conspiracy theorists' favorite case, suicide of White House counsel Vincent Foster; influential haters number perhaps 100, but their suspicions percolate to far larger audience; Pat Matrisciana, producer of Christian-right videos, has about 300,000 copies of his Clinton Chronicles video in circulation; photos; diagram on theories about Foster death; fixations seem to reveal less about Clinton than about strain of paranoia abroad in land, and deep distrust of Government and newspapers; Little Rock columnist Gene Lyons notes that, no matter what one thinks about Whitewater case, Clinton does not merit such hatred, except as symbol of what some people fear (L)

Officials said this conclusion was based on a wealth of evidence, including ''highly reliable'' informers' reports that the Governor, Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera, took part in meetings in which leading traffickers paid high-level politicians who were protecting their operations.

VMexico warned today that any move by the United States to downgrade this country's standing as a partner in the effort to fight narcotics smuggling would jeopardize Mexico's future cooperation in the drug war. Faced with a growing clamor in Washington about the corrupting influence of Mexican drug lords, Foreign Minister Angel Gurria issued a strongly worded appeal to President Clinton today, asking him to renew Mexico's certification as a cooperative ally in the fight against drugs when he files an annual progress report to Congress this week.

VWhen the letter from the Orange County government arrived last week, Rod Dunaway knew what it said even before opening the envelope. A heavy-equipment operator from Mission Viejo who smokes marijuana to relieve pain from glaucoma, Mr. Dunaway, 38, had recently taken a random drug test under a 1991 Federal law that requires random testing of many transportation workers. He tested positive for marijuana, and is now being dismissed by the county.

The emergency decree, which authorized ''all force'' by the army, police and secret police, came as enraged protesters ransacked military warehouses, burned buildings and looted banks in the southern half of the country. It remained unclear whether President Sali Berisha would be able to crush the riots, which erupted after the collapse of fraudulent investment schemes. A1 Swedes Concerned Over Gang Hundreds of Hell's Angels gathered in Sweden to celebrate the opening of the motorcycle gang's third clubhouse there in five years. Among the uninvited guests were some 300 Swedish police officers, who made sure the Angels had a miserable time. Law enforcement experts said the alarm was justified, as the Angels and a rival gang have expanded their territory in Scandinavia, bringing violence in their wake. A1

The annual Partnership Tracking Study for 1996, which focuses on children 9 through 12 years of age, found those children to be influenced by teen-agers' use of drugs, primarily marijuana.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-11 Colombia Halts Eradication Of Drug-Producing Crops Colombia suspended all aerial eradication of drug-producing crops and began an overall review of its cooperation with the United States in fighting drug trafficking. It appeared to be a response to Washington's decertification of Colombia as a cooperating partner in the fight against drugs. A1 U.S. Delegation Visits Mexico Several senior Clinton Administration officials visited Mexico City and met with President Ernesto Zedillo and his top aides. Officials refused to provide details about the visit, saying only that the delegation discussed joint anti-narcotics efforts with Mexico and preparations for President Clinton's first state visit to Mexico, scheduled for April 11 and 12. A9 Arafat's Whirlwind U.S. Tour Yasir Arafat sailed through New York, Georgia and Texas, seeking to put pressure on Israel to halt plans to build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian leader said agreements between Israel and the Palestinians might unravel without some change in the settlement decision. His trip was not without some unexpected theater, including a misunderstanding over where his plane would land. A3 Mubarak Denies Israeli Appeal President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said he would not intervene in the case of an Israeli accused of spying and scheduled to stand trial in Cairo, despite an appeal from the visiting Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Security officials said prosecutors would ask for the harshest possible sentence. Mr. Mubarak meets with President Clinton on Monday. A3 Swiss Propose Holocaust Fund President Arnold Koller of Switzerland proposed creating a $4.7 billion fund and using its interest earnings to aid victims of the Holocaust and other calamities. The proposal, under which Switzerland's gold reserves would be revalued, would offer longterm commitments to Holocaust survivors. The Swiss National Bank also offered to donate $70 million to a separate fund set up for short-term help. Both ideas require Parliament's approval. A6 North and South Korea Meet A senior delegation from North Korea met with United States and South Korean officials in New York City to discuss the possibility of negotiating a formal end to the Korean War. The Clinton Administration considered North Korea's attendance at the meeting a significant development in a discussion of lasting peace. A5 Albania Standoff Intensifies Albanian Government forces fought to regain control of two southern coastal towns that have become strongholds for armed citizens who are enraged at the Government for failing to warn them about fraudulent investment schemes. A6 NATIONAL A14-20, B10-12 Mrs. Clinton's Top Aide Handled a Political Gift Hillary Rodham Clinton's chief of staff handled a $50,000 donation to the Democratic Party from a California businessman who is central to investigations into improper fund-raising activities by the Democrats, Administration officials said. It was the first admission that a campaign donation had passed through the hands of an official on the White House grounds during the Clinton Administration. A1 Hubbell Was Paid $400,000 Webster L. Hubbell, the former Associate Attorney General, received more than $400,000 from a dozen enterprises after he was forced out of office to face a criminal investigation in 1994, according to his associates and Government records. Among the donors were the organizers of a multibillion-dollar development in China that won the Clinton Administration's backing. A1 Health Records Called Insecure The computerized medical records of millions of Americans are subject to misuse or abuse, but few people recognize that fact, a committee of the National Research Council said. Many steps could be taken to increase the security and privacy of the records, but little is being done because there are few incentives to safeguard them, the panel said. A1 Ohio River Surges Inland The Ohio River ran over its banks at Cincinnati and up the slope to Cinergy Field, the former Riverfront Stadium, which found itself in the river. The death toll from one of the Ohio Valley's worst floods of the century rose to more than 20, including four more bodies found by rescue workers in Falmouth, Ky., one of the towns hit hardest. Along the still-rising Ohio, where at least 5,000 families have been forced from their homes, many towns and cities were facing yet higher water. A14 Flak for Head of F.B.I. Members of a House subcommittee grilled Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I.'s director, about its provision of personnel files to the White House, its investigation of the Olympics bombing in Atlanta and the shortcomings of its vaunted crime laboratory. A15 Immigration Service Accused A House hearing about the Immigration and Naturalization Service led to accusations that the service had ignored the suggestions of Congressional auditors about how to prevent criminals from becoming citizens. Lawmakers also found that, despite a warning three years ago that criminal applicants might substitute others' fingerprints, the service had not put in place an operation to verify that the fingerprints were actually the applicant's until last week. A20 Indian Spiritualist Honored Pandurang Shastri Athavale, the founder of a spiritual movement in India that emphasizes self-knowledge and the awareness of God's love, received the world's largest monetary award, the $1.21 million Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion. A17 NEW YORK/REGION B1-9 2 Students Are Stabbed, One Fatally, at High School Two students were stabbed at Bayonne High School in New Jersey. One died and the other was critically wounded. A prosecutor said the killer apparently had a grudge against the student who died. A1 Unemployment Jumps in City New York City's unemployment rate reached 9.9 percent in January, the state said. It was the highest monthly rate in three years. Analysts said that the city's strengthening economy was drawing people back into the labor force faster than it could produce jobs. B1 Tightening Access to Guns President Clinton announced steps to make it harder for newcomers to the United States -- like the Empire State Building gunman -- to buy guns. B3 Ex-'Annie' Star Turns to TV Joanna Pacitti, the 12-year-old redhead who was removed from the Broadway-bound revival of ''Annie'' appeared on the Sally Jessy Raphael television show, her latest appearance in a campaign for public sympathy. She brought the house down with a medley of patriotic songs. B1 SPORTS B13-20 Manning Skips N.F.L. Draft Peyton Manning, the Tennessee quarterback considered the best player available in the National Football League draft, announced he would pass up the draft to continue his education. B13 3 Elected to Hall of Fame The Veterans Committee elected the former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda; Nellie Fox, the Chicago White Sox second baseman, and Willie Wells Sr., a Negro leagues shortstop, to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

VAn Airborne Express employee at Kennedy International Airport was arrested yesterday and charged with criminal possession of marijuana for smuggling a half-ton of the drug each week into the country, officials said. The man, Ralph Bien-Aime, of 147-01 Brookville Boulevard in Rosedale, Queens, was arrested by Port Authority detectives and United States Customs agents as he was about to deliver 200 to 300 pounds of marijuana to a home in Queens, according to Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority.

VThe tactic the Clinton Administration has chosen to head off the medical use of marijuana in California -- threatening doctors who recommend marijuana to their patients -- is a dangerous and unwarranted interference with free speech and a patient's right to hear the truth from a doctor. In its effort to enforce Federal narcotics laws, the Administration needs to make clear that it will do nothing to prevent doctors from delivering their best medical judgments to their patients. Proposition 215, approved by California voters last November, makes it legal under state law for a seriously ill patient to possess or cultivate marijuana for medical purposes if a doctor has advised, either orally or in writing, that the use of marijuana is medically appropriate.

VAnyone who grew up in a middle-class American suburb and itched to be one of the in-crowd should feel an uncomfortable twinge of recognition while watching John Sullivan's debut film, ''Sleepover.'' This microscopic study of adolescent summertime angst in a Connecticut coastal town follows a group of bored teen-agers as they embark on a midnight outing that leads to catastrophe. Few movies have captured the intricacies of adolescent peer pressure more tellingly. With characters ranging from 14 to 18, ''Sleepover,'' which opens today at the Anthology Film Archives, observes how gradations of age and experience determine a ruthless teen-age pecking order. The youngest and most naive obligingly endure the contempt of the more sophisticated in order to learn how to follow in their footsteps.

VCongress and the Clinton Administration appear headed for a collision over Mexico. Just weeks before President Clinton is scheduled to visit Mexico, Congress is moving to override the Administration's disingenuous certification that its Government is fully cooperating in the fight against illegal drugs. A successful override would invite a diplomatic confrontation with Mexico. But the crisis would be worth enduring if it led Washington to a more realistic appreciation of Mexico's problems and of President Ernesto Zedillo's failure to address them with sufficient resolve. The Administration invited a Congressional rebuff when it pretended all was well with Mexican drug enforcement. It acted immediately after a series of embarrassing incidents made plain that pervasive corruption in Mexico's police, military and ruling party has blunted drug enforcement and led Mexican officials to withhold vital information from American authorities.

VWherever he looks, Peter Jennings, our guide to tonight's all-American garden tour, finds marijuana plants being tended with diligence, affection and hope. He provides tips along the way on proper cultivation (plenty of light, not too much water), but, as the program's title, ''Pot of Gold,'' hints, his interest is less in horticulture than in the economics of what he says may be America's biggest cash crop. In the Pacific Northwest, he is told, for an investment of less than $2,000, the indoor gardener can make $200,000 a year tax free. Twenty-something entrepreneurs have joined together in this cottage, or ranch house, industry. One of them comments that whoever it was who said money doesn't grow on trees didn't know ''what trees to look at.'' We also meet the area's Johnny Potseed, who is on a mission to subvert laws against marijuana.

VPresident Clinton, who said in 1992 that he had tried marijuana as a Rhodes scholar in England but ''didn't inhale it,'' today dismissed the notion that baby boomers who had tried drugs had difficulty steering their own children away from experimentation. At an ABC radio ''town hall'' meeting with children about drugs, he was asked what he had told Chelsea about his own experience. Mr. Clinton said: ''Well, I basically told her what I've told everybody in America, which is, when I was 22 years old in England and I thought there were no consequences, I tried marijuana a couple of times. But if I had known then what I know now about it, I would not have done it.''

VMissing persons and people who are homeless, loveless, orphaned, abandoned or otherwise lost to the world converge in THE ECHO (Putnam, $23.95), another cunning psychological mystery from Minette Walters on the provocative subject of fatally intersecting lives. When a homeless man who calls himself Billy Blake starves to death in the garage of a woman who calls herself Amanda Powell, long-buried secrets start spilling out of their graves. Who was Billy Blake, besides a tormented man who shared the bleak poetic visions of William Blake? (''My mother groaned, my father wept.'') What was his relationship to Amanda's missing husband and the lover she refuses to acknowledge? And where, oh where, are the millions of dollars that disappeared with all the castoff identities? Michael Deacon, a magazine reporter whose professional interest in Billy's death develops into a deeper curiosity about his enigmatic life, pursues these questions single-mindedly with a little band of misfits who become his researchers. With so many threads to weave into the tight designs of her plot, Ms. Walters can use every one of these battered souls. The only price they exact is the rather jarring light and warmth they bring to an otherwise cold, dark tale. The technology in Jeffery Deaver's new thriller, THE BONE COLLECTOR (Viking, $22.95), is so dazzling it makes your eyes water. Lincoln Rhyme, a New York forensic scientist known in the trade as ''the world's foremost criminalist,'' uses a scanning electron microscope, an energy-dispersive X-ray unit, a vacuum metal fingerprint unit and a computerized gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer to analyze the tantalizing clues (rat hairs, bone dust, pocket lint, ladies' underwear) harvested from a serial killer's gruesome crime scenes. Quite a lot of loving detail also goes into this clever maniac's precision methods (including scalding and flaying and wild-animal attack) of inflicting torture and death. In his own lunatic way, he is every bit the scientist that Rhyme is. The problem here is that when their tools are in the toy chest, Mr. Deaver doesn't know what to do with his characters, except inflate them into caricatures. Rhyme, a quadriplegic whose movement is restricted to one finger, has no more credibility as a crimebuster than the inexperienced beat cop who becomes his lover and helpmate, although neither cuts as absurd a figure as the unmasked killer. Stick with the machines -- they're sexier. Anne Perry pushes the English manor-house mystery into dangerous new territory with ASHWORTH HALL (Fawcett Columbine, $24), which takes its title from the lordly country estate where leaders of opposing political factions from England and Ireland meet in the autumn of 1890 to hold secret, and entirely uneasy, talks on ''the Irish Problem.'' Little momentum builds from the opening plot moves, bogged down as they are by the pompous palaver of the Brits and the pseudopoetic gush of the Irish. Things pick up, though, when one Irish firebrand is discovered in bed with the wife of his enemy, and by the time the conference leader is found murdered in his bath, this one is off to the races. Superintendent Thomas Pitt of the Bow Street Station finds himself in this august company because of his wellborn wife's social connections. But this son of a gamekeeper is at home in the country, which gently softens his city-hardened sensibilities. ''He could remember too clearly being one of the servants himself ever to take them for granted,'' Ms. Perry says, succinctly explaining Pitt's compassionate manner with the frightened and the grief-stricken. In the end, though, it is his shrewd wife, Charlotte, who cuts to the core of the nationalist issues and reduces them to human scale. This subtle play on sex roles, a constant in this rewarding series, may well be the secret of its profound appeal. Bill Donovan, a captain with the New York Police Department who handles crimes involving ''weird suspects and exotic weapons,'' gets his heart's desire in Michael Jahn's sophisticated whodunit MURDER ON THEATRE ROW (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $23.95) when a killer with a crossbow makes a backstage appearance at ''Casablanca: The Musical.'' To make Donovan's job even more interesting, the weapon was stolen from the grave of a vaudeville performer buried in the subbasement of a newly restored theater (not unlike the historic New Amsterdam) in Times Square, and the ''weird'' suspects include an alcoholic music critic, various vicious actors and an English producer with a taste for extravagantly tasteless musicals. Mr. Jahn's forensic procedures don't bear serious scrutiny, but the author knows his way around the theater and has his sly fun sending up sacred cows and baring his nightmarish vision of the Disneyfication of Times Square. Now and then, even the best regional authors get a little maudlin about the beauty of their backyards. Not Gerry Boyle. His series hero, a journalist named Jack McMorrow who traded his urban crawl space for a cabin in the Maine wilderness, is too honest an observer to sentimentalize rural life. In POTSHOT (Putnam, $23.95), he wonders at the ''odd combination of momentum and inertia'' on which the old logging towns survive: ''People lived in these hard-bitten little towns because other people had lived here before them. That was the momentum; the inertia kept them from leaving.'' Maybe that's why Jack is so taken with a family of enterprising hippies who are growing marijuana in the woods. But before he can finish his article on their grass-roots drive to legalize the weed, the pot growers disappear and Jack makes the acquaintance of some serious drug dealers. Although it nearly kills him, he finally writes ''a good, real raw story'' that is not the least bit picturesque, but rather beautiful.

VIT'S 11 A.M. and Bobby Zarem is already having his first panic attack of the day. Lauren Bacall is on hold. So is Matthew Modine. Another line rings. He grabs it, even though his four assistants are idle, patiently waiting for their boss, one of New York's most compulsive and enduring celebrity publicists, to finish telling that story again, the one about meeting President Clinton the previous night. ''He knew who I was before I even opened my mouth,'' Mr. Zarem tells Ms. Bacall, after picking up the phone. ''I had tears in my eyes.''

VON Officer Brett Carlson's beat, there are no backroads of a poor neighborhood. There are no abandoned cars or graffiti-ridden walls. Officer Carlson patrols Strathmore Ridge, a standard, suburban condo complexwith six-to-eight unit dwellings, lawns, entrance gates and playgrounds. Built in the 1960's, the community offered affordable dwellings for retirees and young families. But within the last few years it has provided something different: in this wooded section of Ridge, drug pushers and buyers operate under a cloak of near-invisibility.

VTo the Editor: President Clinton has talked to his daughter, Chelsea, about his experiences with marijuana (news article, March 13). One wonders what he told her. Surely he did not say that the people he smoked with went crazy or became sick or addicted to heroin. Most of those Rhodes Scholars became lawyers, academics and public servants. Was that bad? Perhaps, but most do not think so.

VWithout being asked, Donald Watson cupped his hands to his mouth and began blowing and sucking air in choppy rhythms, all the while humming in his throat and tapping his feet in counterpoint. ''That's the way Chris used to do it,'' he said of the rap beats echoing off the dingy facades in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn where the two men used to rap, joke and trade stinging gulps of Olde English malt liquor. Of course, Mr. Watson added, that was years before his friend Christopher G. Wallace -- better known by his double-fisted monikers Biggie Smalls and the Notorious B.I.G. -- first made it big in the early 1990's. That was long before Mr. Wallace became an intimidating, 280-pound bejeweled icon of rap who was almost as well known for his girth and gangster guile as for his darkly clever lyrics and the cloud of trouble and marijuana smoke that seemed to follow him everywhere.

VIt was exactly six years ago this month that Albanian immigrants, fleeing poverty at home, first descended on this port city. Back then the people of Brindisi rallied by cooking great vats of spaghetti, collecting piles of used clothing and literally opening their homes to the poor, bedraggled immigrants. This time, as a smaller exodus makes its way across the Adriatic to Italy's southeast coast, the reaction is different. As buses whisk through the city streets carrying new arrivals from their rickety vessels to ad-hoc processing centers, the reception here is not only cooler, but often downright suspicious.

VThe United States has sharply criticized Mexico for failing to seize more than $160 million that American officials say they believe was deposited in Mexican banks by a drug trafficking suspect. In a statement this week, the Treasury Department said it was registering its ''strong protest'' over Mexico's handling of the case. But Mexican officials said today that the American statement was based on a misunderstanding of how much money the suspect had in his accounts.

VThe Senate voted today to support President Clinton's certification of Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs, but only after harshly criticizing Mexico's efforts and extracting a promise from the Administration to press Mexico to do more. The legislation passed, 94 to 5, in a compromise that Senate and White House negotiators reached on Wednesday night after a week of intense efforts to forestall a Senate vote to declare Mexico uncooperative -- a move that would have embarrassed the Administration and brought economic sanctions against Mexico.

VAt this dusty border crossroads east of San Diego, two Federal inspectors helped a Mexican drug ring move hundreds of pounds of cocaine across the border, simply by waving the smugglers through the checkpoint without even glancing inside their cars. In El Paso, two Federal Customs inspectors tried to shake down an informer posing as a drug smuggler, one of them demanding more than $1 million to look the other way when cocaine-laden vehicles crossed from the Mexican border city of Juarez into the United States.

VBRIBERY ON THE BORDER -- A special report.
p37814
ssVabstract
p37815
VSpecial report, Bribery on the Border, finds corruption of law-enforcement officials, at local and Federal levels has become corrosive byproduct of vast river of narcotics that pours into US across 2,012-mile border with Mexico; at least 46 Federal, state and local law enforcement officials have been indicted on or convicted of drug-related corruption charges in last three years in border states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas; number, which includes only cases in which drugs are transported across border by land, represents only small part of problem, since corruption often involves passively allowing smugglers to operate, making it extremely difficult to detect and even tougher to prosecute; Federal law enforcement officials openly concede they fear problem will grow worse as dealers have become more brazen and volume and value of drugs moving across border have skyrocketed; large-scale drug trafficking has continued, despite vows by successive US Administrations to stop it; traffickers, responding to US interdiction efforts in mid-1980's, shifted routes from Florida to Mexico, increasing reliance on Southwest border as transit point; Customs Service reports at five border crossings in California-Mexico border, marijuana seizures increased to 3,518 in 1996 from 2,490 in 1995--or more than 272,000 pounds of marijuana seized in 1996; photos; map; charts (L)

VINTERNATIONAL A3-9 Israel Presses Arafat On Steps to Curb Attacks Israel demanded that the Palestinian Authority take measures against further terrorism, but fell short of threatening to stop peace negotiations. The Government's statement was accompanied by declarations from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security chiefs charging the Palestinian leadership with giving an indirect ''green light'' for terror attacks. Security forces maintained a high alert after Friday's bombing in Tel Aviv. A1 Palestinian police officers faced the wrath of their own people as they tried to control a crowd hurling stones at Israeli soldiers. A6 Zaire Leader Ends Isolation Zaire's ailing President, Mobutu Sese Seko, made his first public appearance since returning home. He promised to unite his country, but gave no indication of how he planned to do it. Western diplomats predicted that he might resign, form a new Government or create a ''national council'' free of his control and give opposition parties a greater role in government. A9 An American Army airborne unit arrived in Congo to prepare for the possible evacuation of Americans from Zaire. A9 Chaos Continues in Albania Albania's President, Sali Berisha, dug in his heels and said he would not be ''blackmailed'' into resigning. Rebels from the port of Vlore, for their part, repeated their demand that Mr. Berisha go. One group from Vlore circulated a petition threatening the head of the secret police with death unless he resigned. Inflation soared. A8 European officials said the European Union was expected to provide a small contingent to provide security for the delivery of food and other aid in Albania. A8 Philippine Cloak for Korean Reporters scrambled frantically in the Philippines to try to find a North Korean defector being given refuge there temporarily after he was allowed to leave Beijing. The Government confirmed that he was in the country, but reporters were marveling at the success of officials at keeping their secret. A4 Belarus Expels U.S. Envoy An American diplomat was asked to leave Belarus after taking part in an anti-Government rally, state television said. The statement said that the embassy's first secretary had been detained during a protest against the President's pro-Moscow policies. In Washington, the White House said that the official would comply. A8 Burmese Religious Conflict Officials tightened security in the capital of Myanmar, formerly Burma, because of religious conflict. The unrest began a week ago in Mandalay, when Buddhist monks attacked mosques after reports that a Buddhist girl had been raped by a Muslim man. Monks play a major role in the affairs of the largely Buddhist country. A6 NATIONAL A10-13, B5-6 Deal With Cigarette Maker Yields Little for Smokers Thousands of smokers and their families stand to gain little financially under a proposal in which one of the nation's large cigarette makers would settle all present and future lawsuits by smokers, their survivors, cities, counties and insurers. An Alabama judge has given preliminary approval for the settlement with the company, the Liggett Group. That settlement is separate from one in which Liggett agreed to admit that smoking is addictive and causes cancer. A1 Drug Corruption on the Border Law-enforcement authorities said they had mounting evidence of systemic corruption of Federal and local officials by drug dealers in some remote counties along the Mexican border. Some of the suspicions involve customs and immigration inspectors, who had long been considered trustworthy defenders against the influx of marijuana, cocaine and heroin. A1 Rabbis Argue Over Judaism A group of Orthodox rabbis said it would issue a statement declaring that the Reform and Conservative movements, the more liberal branches of the faith, are ''not Judaism.'' A spokesman for the group said the statement was timed to counter efforts by Reform and Conservative leaders to gain official recognition for their movements in Israel. The statement was criticized by a number of Jewish religious leaders, including the president of the nation's largest Orthodox rabbinic organization. A11 New Guideline on Mammograms The American Cancer Society recommended that women begin annual mammograms to detect breast cancer at age 40. Until now, the cancer society had urged mammograms every year or two for women in their 40's. The society's board of directors announced the change at a science writers' conference. A10 Thaw Floods North Dakota Runoff from melting snow flooded hundreds of homes across North Dakota as ice jams sent rivers pouring over their banks. Several residents had to leave Beulah and Hazen, N.D., two small towns roughly 50 miles northwest of Bismarck where the Knife River spilled over its banks. The National Weather Service issued flood warnings for broad areas of western and south-central North Dakota, after two days of temperatures in the 50's. (Reuters) 2 Slain in Philadelphia Two women were bound, gagged, raped and killed in the West Philadelphia row home they shared, the police said. Arnim Evans, 28, of Philadelphia was charged with murder and rape after officers pulled him out of the home of the victims, Pamela Blue, 24, and Roseann Young, 35. Six unharmed children, ages 1 to 9, were in the home. The police said Mr. Evans was an acquaintance of the women. Capt. Joseph Mooney said the women appeared to have been strangled. (AP) NEW YORK/REGION B1-4 Whitman Assailed on Plan To Cover Pension Shortfall Governor Whitman is seeking to borrow $2.9 billion over 35 years to help cover a shortfall in New Jersey's pension system -- the first time any state has floated bonds to cover pension liabilities. She faces a $750 million budget gap in a year when she is running for re-election. Her critics said the plan would burden future taxpayers with the costs of the tax cuts she boasts about now. A1 Objections to Private Prison Several New York State officials said they objected to a company's proposal to build a privately owned prison in the Catskills and take in prisoners from other states. State law prohibits New York's own prisoners from being housed in private prisons, and Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco said he was not sure that the law would even allow the prison to take inmates from elsewhere. Officials in Fallsburg, where the prison would be built, said they needed it to shore up their tax base, especially since the State Senate's vote in January against casino gambling in the Catskills. B1 Schumer Criticizes Tuition Rise Representative Charles E. Schumer criticized Governor Pataki's proposal to increase tuition for New York's public college students by $400. Mr. Schumer, a Democrat who is thought to be considering a challenge to Mr. Pataki next year, urged the adoption of his own plan, which would allow parents to create tax-exempt savings accounts for tuition while their children are young. B2 Giuliani Defends End to Plan Mayor Giuliani vigorously defended his decision three years ago to dismantle an affirmative action program that steered city contracts to minority-owned businesses. He said the program, begun under Mayor David N. Dinkins, was of questionable legality. Critics have charged that minority-owned businesses are suffering under Mr. Giuliani. B2 Children See Murder-Suicide A man fatally shot his estranged girlfriend inside her apartment in upper Manhattan and then killed himself in front of the woman's teen-age daughter and 2-year-old son, the police said. The children were not injured. The police said the deaths were the culmination of a dispute between the victims. B3 SPORTSMONDAY C1-9 Arizona and N. Carolina Win Arizona yielded a 7-point lead with 1 minute 15 seconds to play, but held on to defeat Providence in overtime, 96-92, to win a trip to the Final Four. The Wildcats will face North Carolina, which earned its fourth -- and least expected -- trip of the decade to the national semifinals by exploiting Louisville's limitations in height and shooting ability to win, 97-74. The other semifinal game will pit Minnesota, which defeated U.C.L.A. 80-72 on Saturday, against Kentucky, which beat Utah 72-59. C1 Nets Apologize for Outburst The Nets publicly apologized for an outburst in which Coach John Calipari had called a reporter a ''Mexican idiot.'' The incident occurred when Calipari spotted the reporter while arguing with another writer in the team's parking lot. Calipari declined to discuss the incident. The reporter, Dan Garcia of The Star-Ledger, sent a letter about it to the N.B.A.; a league official said he could not comment because the letter had not yet arrived. C1 ARTS C11-15 Cuts Ahead for Lloyd Webber Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group is poised to reduce its New York staff in the wake of the closing of ''Sunset Boulevard.'' The group's London office has already reduced its staff by half. The financial failure of ''Sunset'' was just one of several setbacks the group has suffered recently. A1 Independents Take On Oscars The annual celebration of independent films that is held just before the Academy Award ceremonies took on the air of a rival Oscar night, with stretch limousines and hordes of camera crews at the entrance. Four of the five films competing tonight for best picture are independents. C11 BUSINESS DAY D1-10 China Grabs Investment Share A study released by the World Bank showed that China now attracts more than a third of all the investment in factories and other manufacturing facilities in developing nations.

VIs it possible that when the ascendant Newt Gingrich of '94 wrapped himself in the Leninist revolutionary rhetoric of the New Left, he wasn't kidding? Two years later -- as Mr. Gingrich slinks behind Al Gore to make nice to the Chinese -- it's becoming as easy to mistake the Republicans for McGovern Democrats as it is to mistake the Democrats for Rockefeller Republicans. Ideological cross-dressing, far from being a passing expedience concocted by Dick Morris and Bill Clinton for a re-election campaign, has turned into a bipartisan rage. Mr. Gingrich is now ''the most powerful liberal in American politics,'' writes a betrayed Representative Pete King, the New York Republican, in The Weekly Standard this week, citing the Speaker's retreat from tax cuts, his embrace of the movie star Alec Baldwin and the National Endowment for the Arts, and his decision to invite Jesse Jackson as an honored guest to January's State of the Union festivities. Not to be outflanked on the left, Jesse Helms was photographed on Tuesday holding hands with Madeleine Albright and may soon reverse his obstruction of an international chemical-weapons ban. Michael Reagan, the Los Angeles talk-show host, is so disgusted by such Republican drifts away from his father's ideals and toward Socialism that last week he resigned from the G.O.P., calling it ''the Rodney King party.''

VNo, the six black friends hanging out together in a Boston apartment over a Thanksgiving weekend, watching television, drinking beer and smoking ''blunts'' (hand-rolled tobacco and marijuana cigarettes), are not waiting for Godot, although it sometimes feels that way. The characters in their 20's who inhabit ''Black and White and Red All Over'' are caught up in a wave of black-on-black violence that is receiving sporadic coverage on a local television station. Exactly how they are connected to these events is revealed only in bits and pieces as the story unfolds. Even by the end of the movie, much is still unexplained. Set in the near future, the film, directed and written by DeMane Davis, Harry McCoy and Khari Streeter, has the style of a semi-improvised docudrama. Drenched in a mood of ominous claustrophobia, it evokes a black urban society so caught up in lethal turf wars that at times the apartment seems like a bunker. Most of the crucial events in the drama take place offscreen.

VEVER since the Nixon Administration, Washington has been pressing Mexico to crack down on its marijuana and poppy fields. The results have been mixed, and now, over the last decade or so, something more pernicious has occurred. Policies meant to push narcotics trafficking out of the Caribbean and destroy Colombia's Medellin and Cali cartels have produced the unwelcome side effect of funnelling drugs through Mexico on their way to the rich American market.

VBlack patches scarring verdant mountainsides that are strewn with burnt trees signal South America's latest inroad in the drug trade. It starts with peasants here clearing a few acres of forest to grow poppy flowers, and ends with heroin so pure it can be smoked or sniffed rather than injected. The heroin, which couriers transport in balloons, condoms or even surgical implants, sells on the streets of cities across the Northeast, in $10 envelopes with names like Revenge and Self-Destruction. It is being aggressively pushed at lower prices and higher purity levels, drawing users whose aversion to needles had kept them from trying heroin.

That conclusion, long suspected by family violence and criminal justice experts, has been confirmed by a study of every woman killed in New York City over five years, one of the first studies of its kind in the country.

VIn a time of anti-immigrant politics Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, is one politician who understands the contribution of immigrants to this country. He played a large part last year in stopping efforts in Congress to make sharp reductions in legal immigration. In a letter published in The New York Times last week Senator Abraham defended the 1996 immigration law against charges of harshness in its deportation provision. The letter requires respectful consideration. What it shows, I think, is that in today's climate even someone as sensitive as Senator Abraham can be swept along to try to justify the merciless.

VOn the night before Easter Sunday, vandalism reigned in the Long Island town of North Babylon. One minute a figure in black was hacksawing through a handicapped-parking sign in the Waldbaum's parking lot, the next minute a thief with more modest goals was stealing plastic straws from a McDonald's restaurant. Stop signs everywhere were vanishing. The blitz of mischief ended when two Suffolk County police officers noticed a commotion behind a bank on Deer Park Avenue. There they found dozens of teen-agers in a parking lot littered with the spoils of vandalism: stop signs, street signs, public pay phones, and at least one flag from a Shell gas station.

VIn the no-good-deed-goes-unpunished sweepstakes, pity poor ABC. Unable to win Nielsen rating points, the number-3 network spent all of March in search of Brownie points by staging a ''March Against Drugs,'' in which everyone from its soap-opera stars to its news anchors enlisted in the drug war by participating in public-service commercials and special drug-oriented programming. The payoff? ABC's efforts have been sniped at by journalists and drug-war reformers like Common Sense for Drug Policy and ignored by most everyone else. The heavily publicized grand finale of ABC's long March -- a town meeting with kids and parents conducted by Peter Jennings on Sunday night -- drew a pitiful 6 percent of the TV audience, the smallest of the network's season. Billed by ABC as the ''D-Day'' of its anti-drug offensive, it was more reminiscent of Tet. On the phone last week, Mr. Jennings described the month as a good-faith effort and a learning experience for him and his colleagues. True, true. But the entire drug war, America's most costly defeat since Vietnam, has been in good faith. The only hope for fixing it is to learn from its failures -- as exemplified by ABC's. The network's good deeds in its March offensive, and there were some, were defeated by hypocrisy, fatuous sloganeering and a reluctance to ask more than sporadic questions about the premises that have made the drug war a quagmire swallowing up lives, money and hope. Teen-age drug use has doubled since 1992.

And so teen-agers engage in the behavior they see being modeled by adults and ignore the cascade of meaningless words.

VNOT for many a day has a President tried as hard as Bill Clinton to save Americans from their bad habits, like smoking and drinking, no matter how much zeal other Americans have brought to crusades against this vice or that. Calvinism, it is true, lay at the center of life in the early years of the Republic. ''It is not quite accidental,'' observed the British historian D. W. Brogan, ''that the first great American novel deals with the public, legal punishment of adultery, and The Scarlet Letter has been more read than its lesson has been digested.''

A European complaint that was to have gone before the World Trade Organization on Monday will be suspended pending negotiations. The Clinton Administration agreed to seek a change in the Helms-Burton sanctions law; its prospects in Congress were unclear. 1 Iran Shunned, but Not by Russia Russia warmly welcomed the head of Iran's parliament and vowed to improve ties with Iran. His visit came a day after a German court said the Iranian Government had ordered the assassination of exiled dissidents, a ruling that prompted most European Union countries to recall their ambassadors from Teheran. Russia's courting of Iran was seen as an effort to placate anti-Western Russian nationalists. 5

The restraining order, issued by Judge Fern M. Smith, will at least temporarily stop the Federal Government's effort to undermine the California law by threatening to prosecute or strip the prescription licenses of doctors who endorse the medical use of the drug.

VThe Governor of Arizona said yesterday that he would sign a bill to neutralize a state ballot initiative that allows doctors to prescribe marijuana, heroin and other generally illegal drugs to sick or dying patients. The Arizona Senate voted 17 to 13 on Tuesday afternoon to suspend a central element of the initiative by requiring that any drug dispensed as medicine be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. A similar bill had already been approved by the Legislature's lower house.

VExpanding eastward since their frequently violent seizure of drug markets in California and Texas, Mexican drug cartels have planted their first beachhead in the New York metropolitan area over the last few months, according to law enforcement officials. So far, the Mexican cartels are largely playing a subsidiary role to Colombian groups already entrenched here. Shipping tons of cocaine and marijuana by truck from the Texas-Mexico border to northern Queens for distribution throughout the Northeast, the Mexican groups are also smuggling Colombian cartel drug profits in bulk cash from New York to Mexico for laundering in Mexico's loosely regulated banking system, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation officials.

VPOLITICIANS are said to use statistics the way drunks use lampposts: for support rather than illumination. The aphorism seems more apt for the war on drugs, which abounds with statistical lampposts that shed little light on the nation's preoccupation with illegal substances. America's drug problem seems impossible to grasp without some sense of its size and scope. But elected officials, and their constituents, want concrete evidence of what is essentially a shadowy illegal activity. And when sensibly vague estimates based on the little that is known won't suffice, law enforcement officials oblige them with numbers that one police officer characterized as ''P.F.A.,'' or ''pulled from the air.''

VDavid Bernt, a 17-year-old high school junior in the affluent Chicago suburb of Oak Park, remembers being one of the few who smoked in junior high school. ''But now if you go by there it seems to be everywhere,'' he said. Not everywhere, perhaps, but researchers calculate that teen-age smoking rates, after declining in the 1970's and leveling off in the 1980's, have climbed sharply over the last five years. Although everything from why the trend began to what might stop it is disputed, it adds up to a huge health problem for the country and a public relations disaster for the tobacco industry. Indeed, the trend has played a crucial role in driving the once intractable industry into negotiations for a global settlement with regulators and its legal adversaries. The negotiations are expected to resume today.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-11 Netanyahu Avoids Charges In Appointment Scandal Israel's top state prosecutors said they would not press charges against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a scandal over the appointment of an Attorney General. They said they did not have enough evidence to prosecute, but acknowledged a ''tangible suspicion'' that Mr. Netanyahu played a role in the case. They said they would charge the leader of a religious party involved in the scandal and would keep investigating one of Mr. Netanyahu's aides. A1 Top Defector Arrives in Seoul A high-level North Korean defector arrived in Seoul, 67 days after seeking asylum at the South Korean Embassy in Beijing. The defector, Hwang Jang Yop, said people in the North had already ''lost hope'' and that he wanted to prevent a war that the desperate Communist Government seemed intent on waging. A8

VConnecticut's State Legislature is considering a major overhaul of its drug laws that would shift the emphasis from punishment toward treatment of drug abuse as a public health problem, in part as an attempt to reduce the costs of imprisonment. Among the proposals are letting doctors prescribe methadone for patients with a heroin problem, forcing more convicted criminals into drug treatment programs and giving prosecutors the discretion to seek a modest fine for possession of an ounce or less of marijuana.

But it is hard to imagine that anyone else in this hilly blue-collar hamlet contemplated the sort of lives that friends and neighbors say Thomas J. Koskovich and Jason Vreeland did.

VWhile New York continues to stuff its prisons with drug offenders, the Connecticut Legislature is considering a more sensible approach that emphasizes treatment rather than punishment. Gov. John Rowland has yet to embrace a package of reforms to the state's drug laws, but the Legislature is pushing him in the right direction. Since 1980, Connecticut's prison population has jumped from 3,800 to nearly 15,000, with about 25 percent of those prisoners locked up on drug charges like dealing and possession. The state spends about $400 million a year to operate its prisons, more than it spends on its public colleges and universities.

VWith its corrugated tin milking barns, sloping avocado orchards and feathery pink almond trees, this communal farm on the lip of the Jerusalem forest is a serene and simple place. Roosters crow at 3 o'clock in the morning, cows are milked an hour later, and each day, 9,000 chicken eggs are rinsed, sorted and stamped. Everyone works Sunday through Friday, lives in a modest house and eats in the dining hall. Nobody needs money on the kibbutz, and no one owns a car.

VPeople are people regardless of their color. At least, that's what Betty and Robert Wardlow Sr. always taught their son, who listened and learned and made his parents proud. And sure enough, as a 20-year-old man it never mattered to Robert Jr. that he was black and many of his friends were white. God is colorblind, too. Everybody knows that, right? These days, the father thinks a lot about those lessons and he still wants to believe them. But some mornings it is harder to find his faith than others, especially when he tries to work up the nerve to go visit his namesake -- in the cemetery.

VSpecial report, Odyssey To Suicide, traces long journey of Heaven's Gate cult, from founding by Marshall Herff Applewhite and Bonnie Lu Nettles in 1973, to mass suicides by 39 members, including Applewhite, in mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif, on March 26, 1997; evolution of farfetched jerry-built doctrine, cobbled from scriptural and occult, and how it attracted others is seen as study of people in vertigo of psychic and religious upheaval; extraordinary record left behind by Applewhite and followers, including letters and other correspondence buried in boxes for past two decades, provide plot points in peculiar passage--from sincere religious zeal to delusional beliefs in divine calling, and finally to what most psychiatrists would call psychosis; described; photos (L)

VDiversity is on all lips. So is closure. So is icon. Just try to get through the day without reading or hearing about someone who is an icon, someone who is looking for closure and someone who is championing diversity. Oh yes, it can be done if you cut the plugs off your radios and television sets and burn all newspapers and magazines as they come through the door. Only the strongest can do that. The child for whose benefit I cut the plug off the TV set in 1949 has not spoken to me since.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-13 Zaire's President Agrees To Meet Rebel Leader President Mobutu Sese Seko agreed to meet the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, whose forces control two-thirds of Zaire, tomorrow aboard a South African ship off Africa's Atlantic coast. Bill Richardson, President Clinton's special envoy to Zaire, persuaded Mr. Mobutu to agree to the talks. A1 The United Nations flew 186 children and 50 other refugees from Kisangani, Zaire, to Rwanda. A12 Mexico Reforms Drug Force Mexico dismantled its main anti-drug force, which was disgraced in February when its director was discovered to be working for traffickers. Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said the agency would be replaced by a new organization, to be built from a nucleus of trusted agents. President Clinton is to visit Mexico in five days. A1 Labor Leads as Campaign Ends Britain's longest election campaign since 1918 ended the way it began: with the refashioned, smoothly operating Labor Party and its leader, Tony Blair, far ahead of the ruling Conservatives in the polls and in line to take the reins of Government for the first time in 18 years. A6 Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, was expected to win a Northern Ireland seat in the British Parliament. A6 Peace Crumbling in Chechnya Russian police fought rebels in Chechnya as a tenuous peace crumbled in the separatist republic. The shooting of a local official in the nearby republic of Ingushetia and a bomb that ripped through a train station in southern Russia, killing two people and wounding 17, added to the tension; Russian officials blamed Chechen rebels in both cases. A3 U.N. Agency Head to Leave Hiroshi Nakajima, the Japanese director-general of the World Health Organization, announced that he would not seek another term in office. He had been strongly criticized by the United States and other countries for his unwillingness to cut budgets. A5 Jordan Offers Entry to Marzook Jordan said it would grant entry to Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, the Hamas leader who has been jailed in Manhattan for 22 months on accusations of terrorism and immigration violations. It was unclear whether the United States would free him, although American and Israeli officials implied that it would. A7 Clinton Satisfied on Hong Kong President Clinton said he was satisfied with the assurances on Hong Kong's future that he had received from the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. But he said he was waiting to see if China's words matched its actions. Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, warned that China's favorable trading status depended upon its handling of the British colony's transition to Chinese rule. A8 NATIONAL A16-24, B12-15 Economy Surges, Driving U.S. Deficit Sharply Down Administration officials predicted that a surge in the economy would help drive down the Federal budget deficit this year to about $75 billion, its lowest level in more than 20 years. With balancing the budget made easier, officials said a deal between President Clinton and Congress was possible within hours. A1 The Senate tried to use a flood-relief bill to grab an advantage in the budget negotiations. President Clinton threatened to veto it. Each side accused the other of callousness toward those hurt by floods. B12 Labor Secretary Wins in Senate The Senate approved Alexis Herman as Secretary of Labor after months of delay over her role in campaign fund-raising. In return, President Clinton backed away from his plan for an executive order directing Federal agencies to consider awarding large construction projects to companies with unionized labor. A1 Exercise Fights Breast Cancer Regular exercise helps protect against breast cancer, scientists who studied more than 25,000 Norwegian women announced. More than a dozen smaller studies have found the same effect, but none were considered conclusive. A1 On Cue, Lizards Evolve An experiment with lizards showed that evolution moves in predictable ways and can occur so rapidly that changes emerge in as little as a decade or so, scientists said. The lizards, left for 14 years on different Bahamas islands, showed distinct changes to match their new environments. B14 Criticism on Veterans' Health The Government is still not doing enough to investigate the cause of health problems reported among veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, a special White House panel said. In response, the Pentagon and the C.I.A. appointed former Senator Warren B. Rudman as a special adviser on the issue. B14 Key Bombing Witness Attacked Timothy J. McVeigh's defense lawyer tried to portray Lori Fortier, a major Government witness against him, as a drug user and a liar who once hoped she and her husband could make big money by selling book and movie rights to their version of the Oklahoma City bombing. Ms. Fortier admitted having taken drugs but denied any interest in selling her story. A16 Talks Break Off in Texas The leader of an armed group claiming to represent an independent nation of Texas broke off negotiations with the state authorities who have surrounded his compound, officials said. Seventy miles away, the police arrested seven men with guns, explosives, marijuana and identity cards linking them to the group. A16 Chelsea Chooses California Chelsea Clinton decided to attend Stanford University next year. It is much farther from Washington than her other choices. B15 NEW YORK/REGION B1-10 $800 Million Surplus For New York City Mayor Giuliani said the city would finish its fiscal year with a surplus of more than $800 million. He said he would divide the money evenly between tax cuts, new spending and trying to reduce future deficits. A1 Arrest in 1963 Killing New York City detectives arrested Lawrence Henry, a 61-year-old father of five, yesterday and charged him with the 1963 murder of Lawrence J. Bart, an executive in the printing business. The police said they cracked the case with the help of a former prostitute who, having undergone a religious conversion and feeling burdened by guilt over her knowledge of the crime, came forward to identify the killer. B1 Acquittal in Abuse Case Burton N. Pugach was acquitted of charges that he had sexually abused and threatened to kill a woman after she ended a five-year affair with him. His defense witnesses included his wife, who, in 1959, was blinded when Mr. Pugach had lye thrown in her face. He was convicted then, but jurors said that record did not sway them in the new case. B3 Audits Blast Harlem Agency The Pataki administration released audit reports showing that the defunct Harlem Urban Development Corporation had received almost $100 million in state funds to help rebuild Harlem but had not produced a single major commercial project. B1 Woman Wins Top Math Prize Ioana Dumitriu, a New York University sophomore from Romania, became the first woman to win the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, the Olympics of college mathematics. The test is so difficult that half the people who take it score 2 or less of a possible 120. B1 SPORTS B17-22 Small Field for Derby Thirteen colts were entered for the 123d Kentucky Derby, the smallest field in 12 years. D.

VThe leader of an armed group claiming to represent the independent nation of Texas has broken off all negotiations with the state authorities who have surrounded him here, a spokesman for the state's Department of Public Safety said today. The spokesman, Mike Cox, said the group leader's silence had apparently dashed earlier hopes that ''substantial progress'' had been made on a surrender agreement that would end the four-day standoff in the Davis Mountains of West Texas.

VIN the fifth year of his presidency, Bill Clinton is finally venturing into the United States' backyard, traveling to Mexico, Costa Rica and Barbados this week to meet with the heads of Caribbean nations. But as he opens what the White House grandly calls a ''new dialogue,'' the discussion is likely to be defined, as always, by a decades-old dependency on one side and cold strategic considerations on the other. In a region where the United States' main concern has forever been its own security, what is new is that with the end of the cold war, the threat of the drug trade and increased illegal immigration has replaced Communism as the Caribbean nations' basis for claiming American attention.

VAccording to the map and the tourist brochures, this is the easternmost country in the Caribbean. But when Bill Clinton and his staff arrive here on May 9 for two days of meetings with the Prime Ministers of the English-speaking Caribbean, they will be landing in a place that is not really interested in providing the easygoing, fun-in-the-sun atmosphere for which the region is known. ''Little England'' is the nickname that this small island nation 1600 miles southeast of Miami wears with pride, and not just because most people attend the Anglican Church and play cricket, or because the harbor police wear uniforms that date from Lord Nelson's time. In a region that has made a virtual religion of relaxation, Barbados stands out as an island of primness and propriety.

VFor 20 years, Alfred Prosper has earned a living growing bananas on a six-acre plot that he owns near here. He is not a rich man, he will tell you, and the work is hard, but he has always made enough money to feed his family and to hire half a dozen workers to help him. But now Mr. Prosper, like thousands of other banana farmers throughout the Windward Islands, finds himself at the center of a bitter international trade dispute that threatens his livelihood. At the urging of Chiquita Brands, a unit of the American Financial Corporation and the world's largest banana producer, the Clinton Administration is seeking to overturn an agreement that guarantees small Caribbean banana farmers special access to the European Union market.

VTHIS was to have been the year of SoHo's demise as an art neighborhood. A number of major dealers have moved northwest to Chelsea, the next art frontier. Meanwhile, SoHo, whose preponderance of late-19th-century cast-iron buildings makes it one of Manhattan's architectural gems, has become the greatest mall in America. It is a retail mecca -- a bit of mail-order heaven on earth -- overrun each weekend by thousands of people who wouldn't know a cast-iron column if they tripped over one. But hold the presses. It turns out that the rise of Chelsea's art scene has not exactly meant SoHo's fall. Admittedly, the exodus of a few leading galleries has changed the way SoHo looks and feels. The neighborhood has lost more than a touch of class, which is to be expected when storefronts formerly plain and empty-windowed as art galleries are now crowded with tasteless merchandise. Take a walk past the former galleries of Metro Pictures on Greene Street and Paula Cooper on Wooster Street, for example, to get my point.

VYOU mean I came all this way . . . for nothing?'' reads the copy over a magnified image of a sperm, part of an advertisement in the first national campaign for an ovulation predictor kit that began appearing in May issues of national women's magazines, including Redbook and Ladies' Home Journal. Not coincidentally, the first ads for Unilever's Clearplan Easy appeared on Valentine's Day. They do not break any creative ground, although their use of levity is unusual for medical product ads. The ads are being credited with increasing sales 28 percent for the little-promoted product, according to February-April figures compiled by A. C. Nielsen.

VWhile she talks, Joanne Fazel (leftmost in photo) scrolls through a medical Web site, hunting for references to illicit drug use. What she sees -- text about the medicinal value of marijuana -- passes muster, so she moves on. ''You're just trying to determine if something's wrong and get out,'' she says, sounding more like a fighter pilot than the mother of a 9-year-old. You might call Fazel a cybermom. As a paid surfer for Microsystems Software, a Framingham, Mass.-based company that produces screening software, she spends her days hunting for noxious material. The product, called Cyber Patrol, has an enormous distribution. Eighty-five percent of people on line have free access to the software via commercial providers like America Online (anyone else wanting it must pay $29.95), and its yes-and-no list is huge. Cyber Patrol automatically blocks distasteful Web sites (CyberNOTs, numbering 18,000) and points toward some 40,000 CyberYES sites that the staff deems suitable. To keep on top of it all, Microsystems employs seven women and five men who roam cyberspace day and night, sniffing around for pornography, violence and cult rants. This private-sector approach certainly has fans on Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers believe private watchdogs are the only realistic hope for policing the Web.

VAn Essex County corrections officer was arrested yesterday and accused smuggling marijuana into the Essex County Jail to sell to inmates, prosecutors said. After a six-week investigation, county authorities caught the corrections officer, Mark Davis, 24, sneaking three foil-wrapped packets of the drug into the jail, said Ray Weiss, the prosecutor's spokesman. Along with marijuana, Mr. Davis was charged with selling prisoners sedatives, Mr. Weiss said. Mr. Davis, who had worked at the jail since October 1994, was suspended without pay.

VWHEN GRIFFIN DUNNE talks about his life, every anecdote sounds like the script of a short, darkly comic film. There's the window washer on a skyscraper, spied that very morning, who was stranded and being rescued by firefighters. Farther back, at age 3, Mr. Dunne discovered his own nanny dead on the bathroom floor. At age 5, leaping into the swimming pool to impress his parents' house guest Sean Connery, Mr. Dunne had to be saved from drowning by the man himself. It is possible that any one of those images will someday turn up on film. Mr. Dunne, who is best known for his role as a yuppie tangled up with downtown characters in Manhattan in Martin Scorsese's 1985 film ''After Hours,'' has had an uneven career as an actor. But he has made his way up Hollywood's success pyramid to the lofty positions of movie producer and director. And though it's not considered as lofty a calling in Hollywood, he has also collaborated on two scripts.

The next day the two girls -- Ewa Zieleniak, broad-shouldered and domineering, and Renata Podgovska, slight and more subdued -- described to the police almost blow for blow what they had done.

VA former friend of Alex Kelly testified today that Mr. Kelly lied to him about events on Feb. 10, 1986, the night a young woman says Mr. Kelly raped her after she accepted his offer to drive her home from a party in Darien. The former friend, Thomas M. Kelly, who is not related to the defendant, said that on the morning of Feb. 11, Alex Kelly told him that he did not drive the woman, then 16, home, contradicting the defense's contention that Mr. Kelly had consensual sex with his accuser in a Jeep Wagoneer that night. The prosecution is expected to argue that Alex Kelly was trying to establish an alibi.

VLike you, I've seen innumerable Calvin Klein ads featuring sallow, sullen, scrawny youths. Not once have I had an overwhelming urge to rush out and buy some heroin, and probably neither have you. Yet the death of Davide Sorrenti, a 20-year-old fashion photographer who overdosed on heroin in February, is now being held up as proof that such images have the power to turn people into junkies. On Wednesday President Clinton accused the fashion industry of ''increasing the allure of heroin among young people'' and urged it not to ''glamorize addiction'' to sell clothes. ''We now see on college campuses and in neighborhoods heroin becoming increasingly the drug of choice,'' he said. ''And we know that part of this has to do with the images that are finding their way to our young people.''

VA new trend in smoking has reached teen-agers, who are experimenting with cigars with unexpected frequency, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today. An estimated six million American teen-agers -- more than one-quarter of the boys and girls from 14 to 19 -- smoked at least one cigar last year, the agency said. A nationwide survey of 16,117 young people also found that 3.9 percent of the boys and 1.2 percent of the girls were frequent cigar smokers, having consumed more than 50 in the last year.

V''I DON'T go out on Saturday night, because I know what I'll see on Monday morning,'' said Elizabeth Spratt, chief of toxicological services for the county's Department of Laboratories and Research, part of the Medical Examiner's office here. And Monday morning often means a double load of work for her department. ''Friday and Saturday nights are bad,'' Ms. Spratt said. ''That's when most drunken-driving accidents and homicides take place. Thirty to 50 percent of all the blood and urine samples sent for scientific extraction from the state police, all the local police departments and the Medical Examiner's office arrive on Monday morning.''

VDOWNTOWN, the place and the concept, has had a remarkable run in this city. For the past 100 years, downtown has been synonymous with certain neighborhoods below 14th Street and any other part of town that is cool, bohemian and a little dangerous. But three weeks ago, James Truman, the editorial director of Conde Nast Magazines, was quoted in The New York Observer as saying, ''I have an intuition that downtown is dead as a subject.'' He said this by way of explaining why he had decided to move Details magazine, that chronicler of downtown, away from a bohemian to a young careerist sensibility. Paper, the magazine's rival, immediately shot back with a dissenting broadside about the death notice.

Within hours, Ms. Hussey was standing, handcuffed and disheveled, before Judge Jo Ann Ferdinand. The judge gave her a stark choice: Stand trial and risk a stretch in prison, or plead guilty and enter a drug treatment program.

VThe national tradition of Memorial Day also means the local tradition of Fleet Week, now 10 years old. The patriotic swell brought on by the holiday, coupled with the sight of several thousand sailors in crisp uniforms and gleaming ships docked on the Hudson, is a recruiter's dream. But while the thought of the military may bring the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines to most minds, it seemed that its smallest branch had the largest presence along the West Side waterfront yesterday. Red, white and blue bags filled with souvenirs and brochures handed out by Coast Guard recruiters were ubiquitous. Take the scene at the Coast Guard cutter Spencer, which is based in Boston. On the dock, Petty Officer Harry Wong, a reservist from the recruitment office at the Battery, pointed out nine insignias -- seven potted plants and two banners -- on the bow that represented major marijuana seizures and cocaine arrests. Aboard ship, tourists were shown a video of the crew's latest interdiction effort off the coast of Honduras last month; it resulted in the seizure of 71 bales of uncut cocaine worth more than $140 million.

She was greeting two medical workers from the Aboriginal Health Center who had driven out the rocky, dirt road on a hot, dry afternoon to check the wound above her mouth -- which needed four stitches and is still inflamed -- and to make sure she was taking her pills for high blood pressure, a racing heart and excessive body fluids.

VWhen the two got to Carl Schurz Park around 4 P.M. that Thursday, May 22, they saw a familiar tableau of serenity and release: the sparkling East River, dogs cavorting, children scaling monkey bars and, of course, their teen-age friends, gathered along the chess tables and benches by the basketball courts, in the cool shadows of the trees. Daphne Abdela was swinging a six-pack of Coors. Christopher Vasquez was staring blankly. She was a regular, but had not been around for two weeks, and the other teen-agers didn't remember her ever bringing him along. She had short brown hair and concealed her pudginess beneath her baggy grunge clothes. He had rimless glasses and a fade haircut. She had already started drinking, her friends recall. Before the night was over, he would be seen drinking, too.

VDespite some tabloid touches, ''Drug Run'' provides a seemingly authentic close-up of one way that heroin travels from the fields of Colombia to the streets of Western Europe. With a concealed camera and the claimed cooperation of the Cali cartel, tonight's ''Cinemax Reel Life'' documentary focuses on a ''mule,'' a young man who is seen swallowing what are described as packets of heroin that he has been commissioned to transport to Heathrow Airport in London. The report was previewed on ''60 Minutes'' last night. There are tips here for the care and feeding of human mules. It's mainly a matter of tending to the digestion, for if that goes awry or if the mule doesn't eliminate his cargo soon enough, his gastric juices may eat through the latex packets with dire consequences.

VA hidden benefit of New York City's decreasing crime rate is emerging now in the Police Department's growing ability to solve homicides, at a time when officials are celebrating yet another announcement of encouraging statistics. The city recorded fewer than 1,000 killings last year for the first time since 1968, according to figures released yesterday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And according to the New York City Police Department, its clearance rate climbed to 85 percent last year. The clearance rate is the ratio of homicide cases closed in the 12-month period to homicides reported during that time. The figure is in stark contrast to the national trend, which has seen clearance rates plummet over the last 30 years as more and more homicides have been committed by strangers.

VSenator Jesse Helms, the Republican chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, indicated today that he would block President Clinton's choice to be the next Ambassador to Mexico, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts. The President's selection of Mr. Weld, a prominent, popular Republican who was considered a potential contender in last year's Presidential race before he removed himself from the running, had been intended as a gesture of bipartisanship for a sensitive diplomatic post.

VIT began as an idolatrous crush. Soon, it had escalated into an elaborate tango of flirtation and desire. It was an ''odd and asymmetrical love relationship,'' one critic observed, that after 11 years was never consummated. It was an architectural affair to remember. And remember and remember. In commissioning Frank Gehry to concoct a fantasy house overlooking a golf course in suburban Cleveland, Peter B. Lewis was in many ways living out the pipe dreams of homeowners everywhere: being blessed with a seemingly limitless amount of money and a great architect to shape their reveries.

The witness, Dr. Kevin Ballard, a chemist from Baylor University, testified about a test he performed on 11-year-old bloodstains from the underpants of the accuser. He said the test showed marijuana use.

VSecretary of State Madeleine Albright's assiduous courtship of Senator Jesse Helms may have gained his cooperation on several foreign policy fronts, but it has obviously not vanquished his despotic streak. Mr. Helms, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has now arbitrarily determined that Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts is unfit to be Ambassador to Mexico, and the Senate shall not even have the chance to review his qualifications. It seems a timely moment for the majority leader, Trent Lott, and his colleagues to take another look at Mr. Helms's unsteady leadership. His committee is central to the conduct of American foreign policy, as the gateway for confirmation of senior diplomats and ratification of treaties. Placing the chairmanship in the wrong hands, as Mr. Helms has repeatedly demonstrated, can undermine diplomacy and embarrass the United States.

VHIS VOICE SHOOK AT FIRST, and he reached for his drink. ''Sherry,'' said Peter Fonda, the man who became an icon of the 1960's as the marijuana-smoking, motorcycle-driving Captain America in ''Easy Rider'' and the innocent who embraces LSD in the psychedelic film ''The Trip.'' ''I just like sherry,'' he explained. ''It does something to my mouth that makes all kinds of things possible there.'' In fact, Mr. Fonda, 57, appears to need little help when it comes to talking. His father, Henry Fonda, who died in 1982, may have been a man of few words, but Peter Fonda is a speed-talker. Words, like swarms of bees, surround him. It's as if -- in addition to his lanky body and narrow face -- he inherited the store of sentences left unsaid by his father, ''the silent terror,'' as Mr. Fonda calls him.

VWhen their lives first intersected at a high school in the Bronx four years ago, Jonathan M. Levin was a graduate student working as a substitute English teacher and Corey Arthur was a restless 15-year-old in his class, a marijuana-smoking rapper who had committed a robbery and was sliding into deeper trouble. Over the 1993-94 school year, the young man was a chronic truant. By spring, his arrests had begun -- for heroin possession in April, for cocaine possession in June and July. By September, he had been convicted, sentenced to one to three years and, instead of being imprisoned, was sent to an upstate boot camp for young first offenders.

VIF the sudden frenzy here over adultery in the military has a familiar ring to it, no wonder: the most directly relevant analogy is not Hester Prynne's New England but Zoe Baird's Washington. Military officers have been having sex for years with consenting adults to whom they were not married, without forfeiting either their careers or their public standing. Witness Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose well-known extramarital involvement with a woman in his chain of command cost him neither the command nor the Presidency. Now, a more limited indiscretion, revealed in the immediate aftermath of the Air Force's bungled handling of an adultery case against a female bomber pilot, will likely cost an Air Force general the chance to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

VAlex Kelly usually sits in court with an impassive gaze. But the other day, he became visibly piqued when reporters tried to get the details on Mr. Kelly's encounter in the men's room with the husband of the woman who says Mr. Kelly raped her 11 years ago. According to a radio reporter, Kevin Kane, who overheard the conversation, the husband asked if there were any paper towels. Mr. Kelly reportedly responded in crude slang that he was relieving himself. Then Mr. Kelly said, ''I'm definitely going to tell somebody about this,'' Mr. Kane reported. It is not known what offended Mr. Kelly.

VThe defense in the Alex Kelly rape trial rested today without calling Mr. Kelly to the witness stand. In the retrial of Mr. Kelly, 29, whose first trial ended with a deadlocked jury last fall, much of the defense's case has been built around the contention that the young woman who accused him of rape was intoxicated from beer and marijuana. With her judgment impaired, the defense maintains, the young woman, then a 16-year-old virgin, consented to sex with Mr. Kelly, a stranger who offered her a ride home from a Darien party 11 years ago.

VSumming up the defense of Alex Kelly, his lawyer said today that the 16-year-old girl who accused him of rape 11 years ago fabricated the story because she felt guilty about having sex in the back of a Jeep with a boy she just met, a boy with whom she had no future because he had a girlfriend. The defense lawyer, Thomas P. Puccio, characterized the accuser, now a married, 27-year-old pharmaceutical saleswoman, as a habitual liar who lied when she testified that she had not smoked marijuana on the night she lost her virginity to Mr. Kelly. It was the combination of the drug and beer that caused her to relax her inhibitions and consent to sex with his client, he argued.

Tomorrow this pride of North Carolina will send up a State Department authorization bill that is not merely a ''chairman's mark.'' In cooperation unprecedented in modern Senate history, our foreign policy budget will bear the mark of both chairman and ranking minority member.

VTo the Editor: While parents can offer children many legitimate reasons not to use drugs, including alcohol, few should resonate with teen-age girls as powerfully as the sexist and scientifically questionable claims by the defense in trial of the Alex Kelly, who was convicted of rape (front page, June 13). Men have long used alcohol to force sex on women, and society has often characterized women who drink as morally ''loose.'' Yet alcohol does not heighten sexual experience. What it does is cloud the judgment of both sexes, making women in particular more vulnerable to rape.

VWANT to see a politician really hem and haw? Show up at his or her next town meeting and ask about the issues now dominating American public discourse: Should adultery be tolerated in the military? Should cloning be banned or encouraged? Should doctors be allowed to help terminally ill patients commit suicide? Most politicians do not have well-thought-out answers to these questions. The political parties certainly don't. Democratic or Republican position papers on adultery? Highly doubtful.

Teen-agers need only retreat to their rooms, boot up the computer and click on a cartoon bumblebee named Buzzy to be whisked on line, through a graphic called Bong Canyon, to a mail-order house in Los Angeles that promises the scoop on ''legal highs,'' ''growing hallucinogens,'' ''cannabis alchemy,'' ''cooking with cannabis'' and other ''trippy, phat, groovy things.''

VNew York City detectives joined Federal agents Thursday in Washington Square Park to arrest dozens of marijuana dealers who the authorities say return again and again after serving short sentences. The joint city and Federal operation focused on eight defendants who were charged under the so-called Federal schoolhouse law, which prohibits the sale of drugs within 1,000 feet of a school, because it carries stiffer penalties. Those defendants will each face a minimum of one year in prison. Fifty others were arrested under the state law for sale or possession of marijuana.

VA tenant was ranting into the microphone at a public hearing. ''Rent control is for the lawyers, by the lawyers and of the lawyers,'' she yelled, jabbing a finger at the officials on the dais, who were rolling their eyes and chatting with each other. ''You don't listen to the people, you keep control by keeping people off balance and creating problems. You whales.'' The physical slur was more than the officials could bear. They rose heavily and went for another round of snacks on the counter behind their chairs. A few minutes later, they were more attentive when a landlord spoke, but he was also a housing commissioner. He offered a proposal that would create affordable housing for people whose annual incomes were no more than 35% of the city median.

VThe holiday toy craze of 1996 has sparked a trend in marijuana circles: Tickle Me Elmo pipes. ''It started right after Christmas,'' says a craftsman in Manhattan who makes Elmo pipes. ''Everybody started asking me could I make Elmo.'' Elmo as totem makes some sense, since potheads can probably sympathize with the ''Sesame Street'' regular's nonstop laughter. Not laughing is the Children's Television Workshop, which has already forced one store in Northfield, N.J., to stop selling Elmo-themed merchandise. We hope that's the end of it, says Lisa Sherman-Cohen, a senior publicist at C.T.W. It probably isn't. Elmo is my biggest seller, says the pipe maker gleefully. I really don't think it'll die down at all.

VMore snorters of heroin in Chicago and New York, among other cities, have taken to injecting the drug for a more efficient high, according to a report on national trends in illicit drug use released yesterday. Other drug users, in New York and Miami, have begun substituting heroin for crack cocaine, dismissing crack as a ghetto drug and believing that heroin is easier to manage, the report found. The report, called Pulse Check and issued twice a year, found that overall heroin use was rising slightly, while cocaine use was generally stable or declining, and that marijuana continued to be popular among adolescents.

VPeople who regularly smoke large amounts of marijuana may experience changes in their brain chemistry that are identical to changes seen in the brains of people who abuse heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine and alcohol, scientists have found. The findings, based on studies of rats, are being published today in the journal Science. They provide strong support for the emerging idea that all addictive drugs corrupt the same brain circuits, although to varying degrees, and suggest that chronic marijuana use may prime the brain for other drugs of abuse, a notion known as ''the gateway effect.''

VTo the Editor: The proliferation of material about drugs on the Internet (front page, June 20) makes me hopeful that we can finally have an informed discussion about the nation's drug policy. Thanks to the Internet, people can read and decide for themselves what to believe. Antidrug lobbyists widely publicize the work of Dr. Gabriel G. Nahas that purports to show the grave dangers of marijuana. On the Internet, however, one can read a critique of Dr. Nahas's work from two researchers at the University of Sydney and perhaps conclude that he may be an unreliable source of information.

VThe story in the paper had to be wrong. It said a drug pusher was arrested in Washington Square Park who had a record of 75 arrests for peddling marijuana and also was wanted on 25 outstanding warrants. The best of reporters can make mistakes and maybe it was a typo. How could a man be arrested so often and keep committing the crime of selling marijuana? And it did turn out to be mistake.

VWimbledon vs. Hong Kong NBC's competitors and many viewers were puzzled Monday by the network's skimpy coverage of Hong Kong's transition from British to Chinese rule. While ABC's Peter Jennings and CBS's Dan Rather were on American television screens, live from Hong Kong, from 11 A.M. (ABC) or 11:30 (CBS) until the end of the ceremonies, the green lawns of Wimbledon's tennis tournament prevailed on NBC until the last possible minute.

Disagreements with his stepfather escalated into hand-to-hand combat in their Queens home. A two-bit arrest was followed by another. Until one day, after hearing his father had died in the Persian Gulf War, Will M. was in handcuffs for stealing a bike at knifepoint.

VBRUSH UP YOUR ZULU. THE NEW South Africa is coming to Lincoln Center. Six plays, in fact, as part of Lincoln Center Festival '97, plus a ''Macbeth'' involving 66 drummers, singers, dancers and actors. It all begins on Tuesday, when the three-week arts festival opens. Still, if one doesn't kuluma isi Zulu or praat Afrikaans, one needn't worry. This time, South Africa is coming with supertitles. An American dramatist has even been working with playwrights here to make sure their syntax translates. Would you call the thief-defeating steel bar on a car's steering wheel a club? South Africans call it a gorilla. Do you care if the birds are swallowed by the fish? You would if, like millions of South African soccer fans, you hope the Moroka Swallows are trounced by Mark Fish, star of the Orlando Pirates.

VA regional newspaper reported today that relatives of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, Mexico's most powerful drug trafficker, had announced his death, but the authorities said they could not confirm the report. Mexican law enforcement officials today visited the ranch where Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's mother lives to inquire about the reports, and they lodged an official request to inspect the trafficker's body if he had died. But television reporters at the scene said the officials had found no body.

VAN amusement park is always a happy place until you've worked there a few months. Sometimes it still is after that. But more often, even the most cheerful workers eventually succumb to day after day of brain-frying heat, screaming children and parents shouting about who cut in front of whose kid in line. Such was my experience when I spent a summer working at a big New Jersey theme park. To be honest, my job as an admissions gate attendant wasn't too bad. All the hundreds of summer employees received free guest passes and discounts in the employee store. Food in the staff cafeteria was cheap. These things were important: while some people didn't really need the money, others did. The latter group included elderly people on fixed incomes and people like me who were trying to scrape money together for the next semester of college.

VIn what appears to be a macabre final chapter for one of the hemisphere's premier pulp fiction figures, the Government said today that ''there are indications'' that a man who died here after facial surgery and midriff liposuction was Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the billionaire drug trafficker. The announcement came during a transcontinental pursuit of the body, in which Mexican anti-drug agents, who once seemed sluggish in prosecuting the drug trafficker, aggressively chased his presumed cadaver.

VWhen the Pepsi-sponsored Smokin' Grooves tour landed at the Coca-Cola-sponsored Jones Beach Theater here this weekend, there were a lot of mixed, conflicting messages. The singer Erykah Badu tried to teach the audience about numerology, beginning her lesson with the question, ''How many degrees are there in a circle?'' and Cypress Hill promoted stupefaction with questions like, ''Is everybody insane in here?'' Ms. Badu wafted sandalwood incense into the audience, and Cypress Hill wafted marijuana smoke. The rest of the acts on the bill -- the jazz-tinged hip-hop of the Roots, the raunchy come-ons of Foxy Brown, the transcendent funk of George Clinton, the playful rap of the Pharcyde -- were no more unified in viewpoint or sound.

VPrince Norodom Ranariddh, who was ousted as Cambodia's joint leader last weekend, said in an interview today that his Co-Prime Minister, Hun Sen, had decided a month ago to seize power in a coup to avoid investigations into drug trafficking by his associates and a grenade attack on an opposition political rally. In an emotional account of recent events and an impassioned defense of his role in them, the Prince said Mr. Hun Sen did not want to face elections scheduled to be held before next May, and had been maneuvered into agreeing to them only under pressure from European diplomats.

VTHE phone inside the trailer is ringing. Dave Moto snakes an arm in the window and picks it up. ''Good afternoon,'' he says smoothly, ''Kea'Boos Enterprises.'' It is his erstwhile security guard, who has been missing for four days, along with Mr. Moto's wallet. She wants to know what's going on. ''Nothing,'' he says. ''Not a damn thing.'' He tells her she cannot have her job back and slams the phone down.

VResponding to reports that President Clinton might bow to political pressure and back off from nominating him as Ambassador to Mexico, Gov. William F. Weld today challenged the White House to fight to win him the Mexico job and said he would accept no substitute. Mr. Weld, a moderate Republican, also took on Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, in what he cast as a battle for the soul of the Republican Party. Branding Mr. Weld as soft on drugs -- which Mr. Weld denies -- Senator Helms has vowed to kill the Governor's ambassadorial nomination by refusing to hold a committee hearing on it.

VOne morning in May, Sgt. Scott Savage of the San Jose Police Department's narcotics unit paid a visit to the newest tenant in the modest one-story professional building at the corner of Meridian and San Carlos: the Santa Clara County Medical Cannabis Center. Sergeant Savage, who has the upbeat demeanor of a young suburban cop (think ''Adam-12'') and wears polo shirts to work, has one of the more unusual jobs in American law enforcement. He is responsible for developing a set of regulations and procedures to govern the distribution of medical marijuana in San Jose, work he likes to describe as ''very creative'' and ''a thinking man's game.'' Since November, when voters in California overwhelmingly approved Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, it has been legal under state law for any ''seriously ill'' Californian to obtain marijuana upon the recommendation of a physician. Ballot initiatives are a famously messy way to make law, however, and the language of Prop 215, which took shape in the marijuana-smoke-filled rooms of San Francisco's notorious Cannabis Buyers Club, is even wispier than most. It doesn't explain exactly how the marijuana is supposed to find its way from the field to the patient without breaking state laws not addressed by Prop 215. During the campaign, California's Attorney General, Dan Lungren, had predicted ''legal anarchy'' if Prop 215 were to pass.

VTo the Editor: In ''Family Values, as Reflected by the Grateful Dead'' (July 13), Bill Kent writes that the recent increase in Grateful Dead-related music festival ''has become a family affair.'' He goes on to quote several adult Dead fans who take their young children to the various festivals across the state. One parent is quoted as saying, ''I always felt comfortable bringing my kids to Dead shows.'' Mr. Kent also quotes someone as saying the shows are no longer the drug fests they once were. I don't know about you, but the last thing I would want to do is bring my kids to a Dead-related show.

VKent Graham has had a busy past few months preparing to take over the Arizona Cardinals' starting quarterback job, but he could not help but notice all of the changes that have taken place in the National Football League. ''You have to be locked up in a box not to see what has been going on in the league the last few months,'' he said on the eve of leaving his home in the Chicago area for training camp in Flagstaff, Ariz. ''It's hard to keep track of who is coaching what team and what player is where.''

VShortly after dawn, sonny wipff is driving the perimeter of his ranch. The sun is just appearing on the horizon as he gets out of his pickup truck and crouches next to a section of barbed-wire fence that has been flattened. He strokes his mustache, reading the traces of footprints and bicycle tracks in the sandy soil, then glances at the bluff on the other side of the Rio Grande, toward Mexico. Here and there, discarded damp clothing and empty plastic water jugs litter the gently rolling flatlands. The bicycles are something new, Wipff says. His neighbor Bud Natus saw the first signs of them, trail bikes and 10-speeds, on the spread he runs for his brother-in-law a few miles away -- tread marks leading from the river toward the paved roads that branch out from the border town of Eagle Pass, the county seat several miles downriver. A few years ago, Wipff -- who, at 57, has lived on the ranch all his life -- would have thought the tire treads were the evidence of the daily passage of people fleeing the poverty of Mexico. Now he suspects they are evidence of bikes modified to carry 100-pound loads of marijuana, which are transferred to vans and trucks for the three-hour run up to San Antonio and the U.S. drug markets beyond.

VSecular societies find their spirituality in unexpected places: mountains and forests, skyscrapers and museums. And bridges; specifically, in New York, the Brooklyn Bridge, and most intensely at night. As crime has dropped in New York and tourism has grown, so has the number of after-dark pedestrians on the bridge. Sgt. John Geary of the 84th Precinct said in his 15 years on and off the bridge beat, he had never seen so many walkers, especially during the recent heat wave.

VGov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts plans to resign on Monday so he can devote full attention to his embattled nomination for the post of Ambassador to Mexico, two of his closest advisers said tonight. Mr. Weld had been weighing whether to leave office for days, and he almost did last week, before his advisers talked him out of it. But he has made no secret of his diminished interest in serving as Governor, and his advisers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he had decided that he could not adequately run the state and lobby for his nomination simultaneously.

VWilliam F. Weld's decision to resign as Governor of Massachusetts and campaign for the job of ambassador to Mexico is a strong step based on his self-interest as he sees it. Now the U.S. Senate should take a strong step based on the country's self-interest, by rejecting him for the job. And, in America's interest, Senate hearings should be held quickly. If conducted intelligently, they will show Americans that the issue is not the senatorial delays in confirming the President's laggard nominations for ambassadorships. Nor is the issue Senator Jesse Helms, who has been responsible for those delays that were not the President's fault. It is drugs, and the survival of the national struggle against them.

VAs a former director of national drug policy, I have been an outspoken advocate of tougher drug policies, and I believe that one of the most troubling social trends of this decade is the explosive increase in marijuana use by young people. But there is another area that the public needs to pay attention to as well: the link between alcohol and crime. Most crime is not related to drinking, and most drinking never results in crime. But some people are far more prone to violence when they are drinking or drunk. The scientific literature strongly suggests that alcohol, like drugs, acts as a ''multiplier'' of crime. The use of alcohol, like drugs, results in higher levels of aggression and crime. And where you find a concentration of liquor stores, you often find the neighborhood to be suffering from alcohol-related social problems.

VNot every governor would give up his job to campaign for Senate confirmation as ambassador to Mexico, but then not every governor has the independent means, political ambitions and quirky instincts of William Weld. Mr. Weld's decision to vacate the Statehouse in Boston sets up one of the oddest and potentially most interesting personal confrontations Washington has seen in years. He may not overcome the recondite objections of Senator Jesse Helms, but in challenging the North Carolina Republican's imperious, parochial management of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Weld does a service to his party and the nation. Mr. Weld's gumption is admirable, but should not be mistaken for pure principle. He has tired of the governorship, as he demonstrated by running unsuccessfully for the Senate last year, and clearly would not mind serving as Vice President or President someday. A fiscal conservative and social moderate, he will now be able to showcase his political philosophy before a national audience as he presses his case around Washington and in the media. That cannot help but be healthy for a party that has defined itself so narrowly on social issues like abortion that it has lost touch with many of its traditional supporters. With inherited wealth, Mr. Weld does not have to worry about being out of work if his nomination dies.

VTo the Editor: I'm neither a Republican nor a marijuana user, but I really felt that A. M. Rosenthal's July 29 column, ''Reject William Weld,'' was off target. Mr. Rosenthal believes that Mr. Weld's support for legalizing marijuana use for medical purposes was tantamount to supporting the legalization of all narcotics. This, Mr. Rosenthal contends, is reason to reject Mr. Weld's nomination to be ambassador to Mexico. As your editorial the same day points out, Mr. Weld is a former Federal prosecutor. Furthermore, Census Bureau crime statistics for Governor Weld's state, Massachusetts, show that the rate of violent crime there fell between 1990 and 1994 while the incarceration rate increased over the same period. This is hardly the track record of someone soft on crime.

VFor years, Senator Jesse Helms has told Mexicans that we are barbarians at the gate, dishonest and disobedient neighbors who should be lectured instead of listened to. No one in Washington has used his pulpit to criticize Mexico as stridently. Perhaps no other American politician is as thoroughly disliked south of the border. For Mexicans, the name Helms is synonymous with Mexico-bashing. And from a Mexican point of view, an enemy of Jesse Helms is a friend of Mexico. Therefore, a growing number of opinion leaders, academics and diplomats here are rooting for William Weld, President Clinton's nominee for ambassador.

Weld's nomination to be Ambassador to Mexico, single-handedly, is only the latest example of a Washington axiom: Everyone is afraid of the Republican from North Carolina. President Clinton was so intent on not crossing Mr. Helms, White House aides said, that he was careful to offer only a tepid endorsement of Mr. Weld as an aside in a speech this week.

V''FOX'S MINI-SERIES ''INTENSITY'' begins with Patsy Cline on the radio and Mom's boyfriend's hand in the marijuana Baggie. Then he kills two neighbors just for fun. That scene isn't in Dean Koontz's 1996 novel of the same name, but Mr. Koontz contends that he is thrilled with the adaptation, because the spirit of the book has been retained. Many would say that is a very dark spirit. In a season of increasingly horrific film and television bad guys, the villain of ''Intensity,'' to be shown Tuesday and Wednesday nights at 8, may be the most frighteningly evil in a long while. Edgler Vess is a serial killer who lives for the look of terror in his victims' eyes. As he explains to two gas-station employees just before he shoots them dead, he prefers hunting to fishing because in fishing ''you can't see anything in their eyes.''

VTo the Editor: William J. Bennett's July 29 Op-Ed article noting the strong link between alcohol availability and crime was on target. Alcohol is the most widely available and most abused drug, and it is the starter drug for youth. Eighty-seven percent of high school students have experimented with alcohol compared with those who have tried cigarettes (62 percent), marijuana (35 percent) or cocaine (6 percent).

VFela, the Nigerian singer and band leader who combined pulsating Afro-beat rhythms and scathing pidgin English lyrics to goad Nigeria's leaders and denounce their authoritarian regimes, died on Saturday at his home in Lagos. He was 58 and had been Africa's most famous musician and his country's foremost political dissident. The immediate cause was heart failure, but he had suffered from AIDS, his older brother, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, said at a news conference in Lagos, Reuters reported.

VGov. Christine Todd Whitman signed into law yesterday three bills that will stiffen drug-sentencing guidelines and make it easier for prosecutors to seize the property of convicted drug dealers. Under one measure, prosecutors may ask courts to order a lien on properties belonging to those convicted of ''dealing large amounts of drugs for profit,'' even if it cannot be proved that the property was purchased with drug profits. Instead of seizing property, prosecutors may ask courts to impose fines of $25,000 to $200,000.

VI AM sure that there is an array of complex psychological explanations for why an increasing number of athletes have taken to carrying weapons. Guns seem to be the new fad, like earrings and tattoos. ''Not athletes per se,'' said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard. ''Athletes from certain kinds of backgrounds. If they came up in a tough neighborhood it is not unusual that a lot of the guys are packing guns. When you talk to them about it they will tell you it's for protection. They had family members or friends robbed or shot.''

Drug use among young adults 18 to 25 years old continued to rise, the survey said, and increasing numbers of young people said they doubted that drug use was risky.

VSeparately, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon had enough power, paranoia and megalomania to fill several shelves of history and psychology books. Think what they might have done together. The product of their only meeting is now a popular item at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, Calif.: a photograph taken in the Oval Office of the President and the drug-addicted pop idol, who had a fancy to become a Federal marshal in the war against drugs. The hilarious mock docudrama ''Elvis Meets Nixon'' lovingly reproduces that historic 1970 photo-op. It even more lovingly reproduces the outfit Presley wore to the White House: a purple crushed velvet suit with a caped jacket, bell-bottom pants and a gold belt as wide as a tire. As two of the film's wry commentators point out, ''You can't make this up.''

VOn a stifling afternoon, Luis Arnoldo Lopez, late of Los Angeles, gathers with members of the Mara Salvatrucha gang to smoke marijuana, sniff glue and inscribe gang tattoos on one another's skin. Suddenly, their conversation shifts to the rival 18th Street gang. ''They killed Cuchillo, so we have to kill them,'' a teen-ager nicknamed ''Snoopy'' complains to Mr. Lopez. ''They have been robbing and killing us, so we have to protect ourselves.''

VFirst of two articles, Deadly Exports, examining effects of stepped-up US efforts to deport growing numbers of immigrants who have become criminals; under effort mandated by Congress decade ago and strengthened with new financing in past four years, US is shipping back to countries of origin legal and illegal immigrants who have been convicted of broad range of crimes; however, program intended to lower American crime rate, free up prison space and save American taxpayers money, is having far more noticeable and unintended side effects; has resulted in exportation of American gang habits in such countries as El Salvador and around Caribbean, and trapped and marked for deportation small but significant number of people who under other circumstances would be considered good candidates to become law-abiding and productive; has also had boomerang effect, in which many who were deported have returned quickly after forging new connections to crime rings in own lands and compounding their ability to commit new crimes in US; effects of deportations in El Salvador, where American-bred gang violence is on rise discussed; Immigration and Naturalization Service has deported approximately 37,000 criminals in past fiscal year, up from 27,000 in three prior years, and more than 23,000 during first half of 1997, for annual rate of more than 45,000; map; photos (M)

With Governor Whitman and every state legislator up for re-election in November, lawmakers have passed one bill after another to keep thousands of criminals behind bars for longer times. And the Governor has signed the bills with much fanfare, saying they will make New Jersey a safer place.

VANYONE WHO HAS SEEN Robert Carlyle only in ''Trainspotting,'' the unsettling 1996 film about junkies in Scotland, might well wonder about his sanity. In that movie, Mr. Carlyle, a 36-year-old Glaswegian, plays the psychotic Begbie with such conviction that the actor himself seems possessed by demons. But, be assured, in the handful of roles that have won him recognition as one of Britain's new acting talents, he has also been gentle and loving. Indeed, Mr. Carlyle is all too wary of being typecast as a ''Glasgow hard man.'' In Britain, he need not worry. True, he has played a couple of psychopaths apart from Begbie. But television viewers here have most recently seen him in the title role of ''Hamish Macbeth,'' a BBC serial about a gentle marijuana-smoking Highlands policeman. In Antonia Bird's ''Priest,'' he played the gay lover of a troubled Roman Catholic priest. In Ken Loach's film ''Carla's Song,'' still unreleased in the United States, he is a Glasgow bus driver who falls in love with a Nicaraguan exile.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-10 Envoy Urges Cooperation In Market Bombing Inquiry Dennis Ross, President Clinton's special envoy to the Middle East, urged top Israeli and Palestinian security officials to resurrect their peace negotiations by working together to find out who unleashed two suicide bombers in a Jerusalem market last month. The 14th victim of that bombing died in the hospital. The Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility, but the bombers have yet to be identified. Palestinian youths and Israeli troops clashed in the West Bank town of Ramallah. A6 Israeli Police Evict Worshipers Israeli police officers forcibly removed some 150 Conservative Jews from the Western Wall in Jerusalem, where men and women had tried to worship together. Orthodox Jews, growing in political influence and currently in control of the Western Wall, insist on a physical partition between men and women. A7

VFor nearly a year, 18-wheel tractor-trailers, driven by seasoned truckers recruited in Michigan, have been rolling northward to New York from the Mexican border, delivering tons of concealed cocaine and marijuana and carrying back millions of dollars in illegal drug profits. Federal officials said the truckers were dispatched by Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking syndicate, once headed by the late Amado Carrillo Fuentes, which set out to seize a share of the New York market, the country's most lucrative, even when it meant encroaching on territory that was the domain of the Colombian drug cartel.

VSix months after city investigators swooped into a shelter for battered women and removed the entire 44-member staff after allegations that workers had forced women to have sex and ignored reports of child abuse, the Commissioner of the Department of Investigation said yesterday that he had found no evidence to support the allegations. The statement by Commisioner Edward J. Kuriansky was in stark contrast with his remarks on Feb. 11, when he announced that he had ''evidence of widespread wrongdoing'' at the New Day Shelter in the Bronx.

V''The Delta,'' Ira Sachs's somber portrait of a sexually confused teen-ager growing up in the South, zeroes in on a quality of adolescent life that most youth-oriented movies bend over backward to avoid portraying: its sheer stultifying boredom. Life is difficult enough if you're a footloose teen-ager with grown-up desires living in a religious household under the watchful eye of parents who view you as a child. Throw in the first stirrings of homosexuality and the angst can be suffocating. Lincoln Bloom (Shayne Gray), the film's baby-faced main character, is a nice-looking white middle-class teen-ager from Memphis who leads a double life. Much of his spare time is spent with a peevish girlfriend (Rachel Zan Huss) hanging around with friends who have nothing better to do than drive around aimlessly, smoking marijuana and drinking beer. Now and then, Lincoln steals off to a remote rural intersection where gay men furtively cruise in cars. Sometimes he visits an X-rated video store that is also a gay cruising ground.

Vacant apartments have become a maze of traps, meant to block out drug dealers' rivals and the police. Electrified wires have been stretched across window frames. Holes have been smashed in the walls and floors to provide easy escape routes. And hallway floors have been smeared with Vaseline to trip up unwary intruders.

VFor decades, the Rev. Patrick Moloney was known as a compassionate priest who battled drug dealers and sheltered homeless teen-agers on the most blighted streets of New York's Lower East Side. But these days, he performs his priestly duties in the picture-postcard site of a former seminary perched on a ridge here in the Allegheny Mountains. And he is known as Federal prisoner 28251-0545, having been sentenced to 51 months behind bars for his role in a $7.4 million robbery.

VIf you live in the South, then you immediately recognize that there is another player involved in this Jesse Helms-William Weld-Richard Lugar struggle over the soul of the Republican Party. That player is the devil. He occupies a much different place in Southern life than he does in the rest of the country. He is a living presence here, not just a concept. I have no idea how he got here; for that information you'll have to consult the works of William Faulkner or Billy Bob Thornton. But, as Jesse Helms knows, he is here, and as a neighbor he takes a little getting used to. True, the devil does have his fun side. Night life in the South is marvelously seedy and there is a very palpable sense of sin. The biker bars are rougher, the gay bars are gayer (the South is the home of drag), the nudie bars are nudie-er. And ah, the parking lot of a Southern bar on a muggy Saturday night. That truly is the devil's playground. With any luck you'll find drugs, prostitution, gambling and firecrackers, not to mention the town's leading minister and a county commissioner or two.

VDRUG-RELATED violence once ruled a stretch of Sixth Avenue in Sunset Park. Three years ago, on the corner at 52d Street, a drug dealer killed a rival teen-age drug seller, firing two bullets into the back of his head. Two years ago, down the street, another teen-ager was held to the ground by rival drug dealers and slashed in the face dozens of times with a razor blade. Residents had lost control. A semblance of tranquillity has settled over the neighborhood now. On these streets of working-class Italian, Irish, Chinese and Latin American immigrants, residents say fear has been replaced by an ease they haven't felt for years.

VAs the man in the videotape begins to spill the inner secrets of Mexico's most violent drug gang, he appears nervous, chewing off pieces of his left thumbnail and gulping water. Alejandro Enrique Hodoyan had been a minor though well-placed member of the drug organization, running guns and errands. On the tape, he sits center stage, recounting in a soft voice how his brother and a circle of their childhood friends joined a criminal enterprise that killed dozens of police commanders, prosecutors, drug rivals and innocent bystanders.

VCarolyn, a prostitute who many years ago abandoned her young son to the care of her churchgoing mother, works a ''crack stroll'' in Harlem, where men come to buy fleeting sex along with their drugs. ''The best thing to do is be where the crack is, because that's where the money is,'' she said. ''When they buy crack, once they take that pull, they want a woman.''

V'Ooooh, I was mad!'' Opal Caples says, recalling the notice from the welfare office. ''They said we had to start working for our welfare check! I said, 'How could they do this to us?' I didn't feel it was right, to take our money -- that's for our children.'' And as a black woman living in Milwaukee's sprawling black ghetto, Caples detected a hidden agenda. No one talked about work rules in the 1930's, when ''welfare was made for middle-class white women,'' she says. ''They're really just targeting the black women.'' A bright, animated, street-smart woman who punctuates her speech with knowing glances -- you know what I'm talking about, her look insists -- Caples is telling her story on the No. 12 bus one July afternoon as it shakes and wheezes down Teutonia Avenue, past the check-cashing counters, liquor stores and lounges. She has dropped her three young daughters with her cousin, Jewel (actually with Jewel's 13-year-old nephew, Little Chuck, since Jewel wasn't around), and before long she'll be toting trash and swabbing toilets in the gastrointestinal lab of a downtown hospital. It's second-shift work and she's unhappy that her girls are asleep by the time the No. 12 shakes home. ''They don't even see me at night,'' she complains.

VThe three wooden cargo crates dropped off by a courier at the international airport in San Juan, P.R., for a Delta Air Lines flight to New York City looked harmless. But when the courier's nervousness raised suspicions about their contents, law-enforcement officials looked inside, and found 1,000 pounds of cocaine. The shipment was part of a scheme that lasted three to four years, in which Federal officials said thousands of pounds of Colombian cocaine were hidden in suitcases and cargo crates aboard Delta flights from Puerto Rico and unloaded for nationwide distribution.

VALLEN IVERSON, the National Basketball Association rookie of the year and star guard for the Philadelphia 76ers, pleaded no contest yesterday to carrying a concealed weapon and was placed on probation for three years. A marijuana possession charge was dropped in a plea agreement. Under the agreement Iverson reached with prosecutors, he must also undergo monthly drug testing for two years and may not own a gun during that time. The 22-year-old Iverson was a passenger in a car he owned that was stopped by a state trooper on Aug. 3 for speeding on Interstate 64 near Richmond. A search of the car revealed a .45-caliber pistol belonging to Iverson and two marijuana cigarettes -- one under Iverson's seat, another in the back seat. Iverson was charged with possession of marijuana and possession of firearms with a controlled substance.

VIf an antiques dealer facing drug and firearms charges and a prisoner serving time in Pennsylvania for art theft and cocaine trafficking are to be believed, they hold the key to recovering 13 works of art taken in the largest art theft in history. And the cards saying simply ''Stolen on March 18, 1990'' that hang on several blank walls of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston may be close to coming down. In return, the two men, William P. Youngsworth 3d and Myles J. Connor Jr., want the charges against them dropped, immunity from prosecution, release from prison and, of course, reward money, which in this case is $5 million.

VWhen a small-town Southern girl ran away to the big city, the first thing she did was dye her hair purple. The second was to assume a new identity: ''Sidney Love.'' Now, a little more than a month later, she may be running with prostitutes and drug addicts, police detectives say. And if all this sounds like a typical New York story, it may be, except for the fact that the Fire Department is on full alert. Last week, posters of the girl went up in every station house, and firefighters circulated more than 1,000 fliers asking for the whereabouts of Tiffany P. Giles, the 15-year-old stepdaughter of a Louisiana fireman.

''I was stunned at how emotional the debate is,'' Professor MacCoun said. ''The emotions are very understandable -- drugs can cause a lot of serious harm to society. But I think the emotions have made it hard to talk about solutions in an effective way.''

The 36-year-old Princess was fatally injured and her companion, Emad Mohamed al-Fayed, 41, was killed when their chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz tried to speed away from photographers pursuing on motorcycles and crashed. A1 French police opened a criminal investigation to determine whether a chase of Diana's automobile by seven photographers on motorcycles was responsible for the fatal car crash. After questioning them all night, the authorities placed the photographers in formal detention, which allows them to be held for 48 hours without charges. A1

VThe brother of a man who was killed by a New York City police officer in a dispute over a suburban parking spot said today that ''the fact my brother was black probably made it a lot easier'' for the officer to shoot him. The off-duty officer, Richard B. DiGuglielmo, ''was territorial,'' said William Campbell, the brother of the victim, Charles Campbell. ''This gentleman would have probably committed the same crime against anyone. The fact my brother was black probably made it a lot easier for him to lose his temper, to act crazy.''

VThe hunt for missing masterpieces stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990 appears to be entering a sensitive new phase of discussions between Federal officials, a jailed art thief and a convicted associate, an antiques dealer who says he holds the key to solving the $300 million theft. The dealer, William P. Youngworth 3d, made an unusual appearance on the ABC News program ''Nightline'' on Wednesday, saying he could ''probably facilitate'' the return of the works, including a Vermeer and three Rembrandts, and was as far as he knew the only one who could do so. But Mr. Youngworth said he could not have stolen them -- and he had the perfect alibi -- he was in prison at the time.

VCRYSTAL SCHIFFER was clad entirely in black except for the words on her T-shirt: Constantly Miserable. Jonathan Miller had shaggy hair, a tie-dyed shirt and shoelaces shockingly pink. Sitting on a curb outside Garden State Plaza last week, the couple enthusiastically explained why their high school classmates referred to them as freaks. ''Everyone else can walk through the hallways and nobody notices them,'' said Jonathan, a skinny 17-year-old who started his senior year at Lakeland Regional High School in Wanaque last week. ''We come in wearing combat boots or black lipstick, whatever, and everyone is staring, nobody can believe it. We stand out. That's our point.''

No matter what the police did to stamp out the drug trade there, dealers stood brazenly on the sidewalks and hawked cocaine and marijuana, even playing games of dominoes between sales. ''Cars were coming here from all over the place to buy,'' said Jose Rodriguez, 14.

VIn a game of 135 plays, Marshall's Randy Moss had his large hands on the football just eight times today. Twice was enough. Moss, a wide receiver who is described by his coach as the best player in the country, turned his first catch into a 90-yard touchdown play, 1 yard short of the longest in the 73-year history of Army's Michie Stadium.

VHugh is a 40-something writer from Phoenix who has a taste for prescription tranquilizers and painkillers -- Xanax, Valium, Tylenol with codeine -- that his American doctor won't let him have. Doc's advice: ''Don't drink Coke before you go to bed.'' Not good enough, says Hugh. So, like hundreds of other presumably jangled fun-seekers and college students, he regularly travels to Nogales, Mexico, to scoop up Mexican versions of these mood enhancers. Doctors in the United States frown on the practice -- many will only prescribe these drugs by the pill -- but as Hugh demonstrated during a recent trip, buying prescription drugs in Nogales is amazingly cheap and easy. No appointment needed, no ailment required. In a twist, it's also legal. U.S. Border Patrol officials only want to see a copy of your quickie Mexican prescription.

VTHERE is no shortage of efforts in homes, schools and communities to discourage teen-agers from taking drugs, smoking, drinking or having sex. The question is, What really works? One answer, from a major study of adolescents, is that families are more important than previously thought, perhaps as important as peers. The portion of the study's data that has been analyzed so far did not look at peer pressure, but the findings call into question the idea that peer relationships almost completely eclipse family relationships in their influence over teen-agers' behavior, said Dr. Robert William Blum, one of the study's researchers and the director of the Adolescent Health Program at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The primacy of peer relationships has been a widely held concept among professionals since the 1960's.

VGaveling his colleagues to silence, Senator Jesse Helms asserted his power as a committee chairman today and, with an iron hand and a snarl, ran roughshod over the nomination of William F. Weld to be Ambassador to Mexico. President Clinton declared the battle ''not over'' and said he would urge Senator Trent Lott, the Republican leader, who has the power to circumvent Mr. Helms, to bring the nomination to the floor for a vote. Some senators were contemplating a move to galvanize public pressure on Mr. Lott to do just that.

VTHE quarrel gets played out daily in thousands of families. Stay away from marijuana, the exasperated parent warns; it will mess up your future. The teen-ager retorts: But you tried it and it didn't hurt you. At home or school, when the conversation turns to illegal drugs the subject is usually marijuana. As many as 70 million Americans, including many of today's parents, have smoked it. And as their children can be quick to point out, the vast majority did not go on to be addicted to cocaine or heroin.

VON a moonless night two weeks ago, as the first of the autumn winds sliced through Tompkins Square Park, a group of shivering runaways clutched themselves and dreamed of nothing more than a warm sleeping bag and a half-smoked butt. Their conversations were the usual ones about dope and sex for sale and the calamity of their young existence. It is the desperate nights like these that make the dim memories of the homes they fled in Florida and Illinois and California seem brighter.

After serving a quarter-century behind bars, Gustavo Colon, one of the chieftains of the notorious Latin Kings, was to have walked out of a downstate prison on Friday. A limousine was to have been waiting to take him back to Chicago, a grand gesture by his underlings in the gang, which calls itself the Almighty Latin King Nation.

VWhen Pedro Marrero, a 73-year-old laborer, took two frisky young grandsons to live in his modest apartment on Manhattan's Lower East Side, he coped as best he could. The boys' father was in prison for drug dealing, and their mother had drifted off to the streets to chase drugs. ''If I hadn't done it,'' Mr. Marrero said, twisting a worn baseball cap in his calloused hands, ''the boys would have ended up being adopted, and we never would have seen them again.''

VWhen the roads freeze in New Canaan, Conn., during the climactic night in ''The Ice Storm,'' the elegant and deeply disquieting drama that opens the 35th New York Film Festival this evening, everything starts to slide. The tenuous bonds that hold two suburban families together have finally come undone. Spouses cheat; drink and drugs anesthetize; parents and children share households but have no common ground. ''If you're worried about anything at all, just feel free to ask,'' a father tells his teen-age son awkwardly. ''And we'll, uh, look it up.''

VThe stories appeared week by week, most of them wire dispatches, not much bigger than dots on the professional sports landscape. There were lines to be drawn, though, connections to be made. When they were, it spelled out N.B.A., only N stood for naughty, B for battery, A for arrest. By its typical expansionist standards, the National Basketball Association had a wonderful summer, with a capital W. But its stunning W.N.B.A. launch aside, the trend of players and other N.B.A. people who show up on police dockets or in embarrassing positions accelerated this off season. Drug busts, gun possession, drunken driving, sexual assault, bizarre behavior, tax evasion, wiretapping -- you name it, someone from the N.B.A. was doing it, and none of these raps could even be pinned on Dennis Rodman.

Youngworth 3d, in sunglasses and a Phillies cigar T-shirt, tucked into a seafood lunch with his wife, Judith. He looked up and saw a peculiar sight: a man on a staircase on the far side of the restaurant pointing a video camera in his direction with its red light on.

VJOSEPH ROSEN is a devoted Kmart shopper. He loves the acres of merchandise, the endless variety, the convenience. Kmart's Astor Place emporium is just a few short blocks from his lower Fifth Avenue co-op, making it a quick bicycle ride away when he gets the urge to shop. It is a balmy Saturday in September and Mr. Rosen has already made two visits to the store. He is wearing a brightly colored nylon sweatsuit, wire-frame glasses and a Jamesport knapsack on his back. He calls it his ''Italian tourist'' look.

''They want to make the park into some sort of grass museum,'' said Ms. Cassell, a lawyer whose Lhasa apso, Monet, wandered (illegally) onto a new bed of grass. ''They came up to me the other day and asked for identification. Identification? I said. This is America.''

VSandy Ojeda remembers vividly the first football game she attended with her 14-year-old daughter at the girl's new school earlier this month, not because of the football but because of the drug raid. Vials came out of pockets as the police searched a group of teen-agers under the bleachers. One youngster cracked his head open as he resisted arrest. By the time it was all over, she said, four teen-agers had been hauled away by the police.

VTHERE are more than seven million New Yorkers. Some 650,000 of them are teen-agers. That's 650,000 running the punishing marathon from age 13 to 19 in a superheated urban environment. Teen-agers may grow up faster in New York than anywhere else in the country. They may be more jaded, and more likely to see their street fashion and their language translated into the popular culture. But wherever they congregate, the rules tend to remain constant. Teen-agers like to cluster. They seek excitement and romance. They flirt with danger. They fight a constant battle against crushing boredom and curfews. They posture. They are embarrassed by their parents. On Friday, Sept. 19, from dusk to the wee hours, a team of writers set out to watch and listen in on some New York teen-agers. They headed for typical gathering spots, from Astoria Park in Queens to Astor Place in Manhattan to a skating and dance center in the South Bronx. Some of the youths were rich, some poor. Some were happy to give their names; some insisted on anonymity. Some looked at Manhattan as their playground; some saw it as a far-off constellation of lights. But for everyone it was, well, a Friday night. In fact, the last of summer.

VWhen Dale Layton and two friends in the suburbs here first heard the call to build a nationwide movement uniting Christian men of all races, they were eager to help as white Christians. But Mr. Layton said there was one obstacle: ''We didn't know any blacks.'' But one of Mr. Layton's friends was an exterminator who had done some pest control work at a black man's house. The black man belonged to a large church whose pastor was an influential black minister. And so three years ago Mr. Layton, a plastic-tubing salesman, and his two friends met with the minister, the Rev. Willie B. O'Neal, sitting at a glass-top table in his church study and trying to sell him and several other wary black church leaders on a new national evangelical organization called Promise Keepers.

VThe message on the answering machine giving directions to yesterday's memorial reading of Allen Ginsberg's poem ''Howl'' could not have been more fitting: from the East 72d Street entrance to Central Park, ''follow the flower children'' to Frisbee Hill. A couple hundred of the faithful gathered in the park, sitting on blankets as they nibbled at vegetarian meals and brownies and listened to poetry readings, to commemorate the poet laureate of the Beat Generation. An overcast sky that constantly threatened to scatter the listeners seemed a fitting backdrop for the hippies, or the hippies at heart, who inevitably appear more anachronistic as the distance from the 1960's and 70's widens.

VTo the Editor: The story of thalidomide is stunningly similar to that of medical marijuana (Op-Ed, Sept. 25). Both drugs are obtained illegally by patients at ''buyers' clubs.'' Both are available through restricted Federal ''compassionate use'' programs. And both have been subject to agitation and prohibition. The difference is that thalidomide is associated with horrifying birth defects, whereas marijuana, for all its controversy, is far less toxic than other drugs used to treat the same ailments.

VThe driver of the limousine involved in an accident that injured two Detroit Red Wings will be charged with driving without a license, prosecutors in Pontiac, Mich., said yesterday. The one misdemeanor count -- driving with a suspended license, second offense -- means no felony prosecution of Richard Gnida is planned despite tests that showed marijuana in the driver's system. If convicted, Gnida, 28, could face up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

VAnnouncing a series of antidrug measures that he hopes to make the hallmark of a second term, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he would expand special police drug-fighting efforts into Queens and the Bronx, offer more treatment for addicts and make Washington Square Park a drug-free zone by placing it off limits to those convicted of selling drugs there. In a speech billed as a major policy announcement, Mayor Giuliani told a roomful of administration officials and police commanders that he thought drug use could be reduced in the city, much as crime has been reduced in the last four years. ''I want to be able to hold up a national magazine two or three years from now and have New York City lead America in massive reductions in drug abuse,'' Mayor Giuliani said.

VIt has been some time since Washington Square Park offered what Henry James called ''a kind of established repose which is not of frequent occurrence in other quarters of the long, shrill city.'' These days the park has been a haven for skate punks, folk singers, buskers and bikers, a draw for tourists looking for the unusual, and, much to the chagrin of the police and neighbors, a drug bazaar. There have been crackdowns before: in 1985, 1987, 1996. Each time, there was an increased police presence and a flurry of arrests followed by a declared victory and then detente. Each time, law enforcement officials said, drug dealers returned to the park as soon as they had made their way through the criminal justice system. One man was arrested for selling drugs there this summer for the 76th time, the police said.

VTOM LEIGHTON twice ran unsuccessfully for Congress as an independent allied with the Green Party. Unfazed, he boned up on the issues as he embarked on his current quest to become Manhattan borough president. While he isn't exactly on a roll this time, at least one of his issues is. He wants to end the prohibition of marijuana. As the candidate of the Marijuana-Green Party, Mr. Leighton says that marijuana should not be lumped together with drugs like heroin or cocaine. With his slogan of ''Health Freedom Now,'' he would like adults to be free to choose (or not) marijuana for personal or medical use without criminal penalty. The money currently spent on arresting people for possessing pot, he said, could be better used to go after more serious criminals or funding alternative health-care programs.

VAfter a summer of disturbing events involving National Basketball Association players, Commissioner David Stern yesterday suspended Philadelphia's Allen Iverson for one game and Portland's Isaiah Rider for two games for behavior detrimental to the game. ''N.B.A. players are obligated to conduct themselves to the highest possible standards,'' Stern said in a statement. ''And these suspensions should serve to remind everyone associated with the N.B.A. that improper or unprofessional behavior on or off the court will be met with appropriate penalties.''

VIsaiah Rider thought he finally was putting some distance between himself and his troubled past when the National Basketball Association sneaked up and slapped him in the face with it. Rider says he was blindsided by the league's decision to suspend him for two games for past off-court transgressions. He believes he is being unfairly singled out when there are plenty of other examples the league has ignored. An image, he is discovering, is a very hard thing to change.

It began one recent morning at 10 in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The jury was sworn in. The judge was ready. The Government was supposed to call its first witness. But by 10:30, it was over. No one testified. No opening statements were made. The judge sent the jurors home.

It cost him his career. Police Officer Christine Pittman lost her job in New York City for what the authorities in Rockland County considered attempted arson. They said she poured lighter fluid on her fiance, then doused the hallway of a Nyack, N.Y., apartment building with the flammable liquid.

VThe disappearance here earlier this year of Manuel Hernandez, a Texas drywall contractor and former marijuana dealer, with two relatives began like many others. Uniformed federal policemen smashed into a working-class home and dragged the men away, in full view of municipal police officers and frightened neighbors. Then came the official denials. Mr. Hernandez's wife, Maria Elba, trudged for days from police stations to hospitals and morgues, everywhere getting the same brusque treatment: nobody knew anything about Mr. Hernandez. Although he is an American citizen, the United States Consulate was not much help either.

VA Toll of 'Disappearances' In Mexico's War on Drugs
p56733
ssVabstract
p56734
VScores, perhaps hundreds of people, including some US citizens, have disappeared at hands of Mexican security police in northern Mexico in recent months, possibly as part of dirty war against suspected drug traffickers, and also at instigation of traffickers seeking to eliminate competition or punished debtors; nearly 90 people have vanished in gritty border town of Ciudad Juarez, including Manuel Hernandez, Texas drywall contractor and former marijuana dealer who waas dragged away by uniformed federal police in full view of local police; officials have denied knowledge, and US Embassy has not helped; human rights groups say nowhere in world have so many people disappeared in context of drug-related violence, and with such official stonewalling; two Americans, Jaime F Hervella and Saul Sanchez, formed association of relatives of missing persons after fruitless three-year search for Saul Sanchez Jr, 35-year-old US Navy veteranwho disappeared in Juarez while selling communications equipment to Mexican federal police; group meets in El Paso for fear of Mexican police; photos; map; Clinton Administration has turned blind eye, continuing to praise Mexico's anti-drug efforts; many of abductions apparently are at behest of Juarez-based cartel of late Amado Carillo Fuentes; Juarez mayor says 'we can't hope' that corrupt officers will act like police in other places (M)

VThe Board of Education's top investigator yesterday recommended dismissing a New York City school security officer who had admitted that he was a leader of the Latin Kings, a tightly organized street gang that officials say enforces its rules through violence. The investigator, Edward F. Stancik, issued the recommendation as he called for a ''uniform antigang program'' that would prohibit gang-related graffiti and what he called ''gang intimidation strategies'' in the schools. Mr. Stancik also urged school officials to give gang-related offenses special priority in the school disciplinary system. ''School officials should proceed quickly and forcefully, applying fair, firm and consistent penalties,'' he said.

VSt. John's Wins Mark Levine completed 20 of 33 passes for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns last night and St. John's beat Marist, 24-7, for its third straight victory. St. John's (4-1) also got field goals of 34, 30 and 24 yards from Christian Soto. St. John's scored 13 unanswered points in the second quarter before Marist (2-3) could get on the board. Levine threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Steve KalbereR with 9 minutes 28 seconds left in the half and Soto added field goals of 34 yards with 2:38 left and 30 with 2 seconds left before halftime. J.J. Allen ran 4 yards for a touchdown with 3:37 left in the third period cut the St. John's lead to 13-7. Levine's 14-yard pass to James Morton with 12:21 to play pushed the lead to 19-7 and Kalberer threw a 2-point conversion pass to Pat Kenna. Soto's third field goal, with 3:40 to play, wrapped up the scoring. (AP) Pitts Has Cancer Elijah Pitts, a Buffalo Bills assistant coach, has been found to have cancer and could miss the rest of the season while he undergoes what the team described as ''prolonged therapy.'' Pitts, 59, the assistant head coach to Marv Levy, underwent surgery earlier this week at Buffalo General Hospital to remove a malignancy in his abdomen. He has started chemotherapy. Levy underwent surgery for prostate cancer two years ago and was replaced for three games by Pitts, who has never been a full-time N.F.L. head coach. He has spent 16 of his 25 N.F.L. seasons as a coach with Buffalo. Pitts played nine years with the Green Bay Packers under the Hall of Fame coach Vince Lombardi. (AP) Morris Surrenders Baltimore Ravens running back Bam Morris turned himself in to authorities in Rockwall County, Tex., yesterday after a warrant was issued on a motion to revoke his 10-year probation on a drug conviction. Morris was arraigned by a justice of the peace and was awaiting a hearing at which his bond would be set, Sheriff Jacques Kiere said. The county prosecutor, Ray Sumrow, said Morris's probation should be revoked because he violated two conditions of his probation by using alcohol and by failing to report to his probation officer seven times from July 1996 to August 1997. Morris, who was suspended by the N.F.L. for the first four games of this season after a drug test revealed in January that he had used alcohol, pleaded guilty to marijuana possession after his arrest in March 1996 on Interstate 30 near Rockwall.(AP) Houston Is Waived The Kansas City Chiefs waived linebacker Bobby Houston and placed safety Kevin Ross on injured reserve with a knee injury that will sideline him for the rest of the season, the team said. Houston, a starter with the Jets from 1992 to 1996, has 354 tackles over eight N.F.L. seasons. (Bloomberg News)

VMilitary law specialists say they will be closely watching judicial hearings this week in a case that raises a fundamental question about the fairness of military justice: Can the accused be assigned a defense lawyer who was previously the prosecutor in the very same case? The case involves Maj. Charles M. Haney Jr., 45, who was convicted in 1990 on drug charges after base-wide urine testing showed cocaine and marijuana in his system. Major Haney, who maintains his innocence and had an otherwise unblemished record after 19 years in the Air Force, was sentenced to eight months in prison and ordered dismissed from the service.

VTWO months ago in Federal court in East St. Louis, Ill., Michael Blucker, 28, a paroled thief, sued Illinois state prison guards and other employees whom he accused of ignoring his requests for help when he was allegedly raped and treated as a ''sex slave'' by gang members while behind bars. Mr. Blucker, who is HIV-positive, says he was infected as a result of the sexual abuse. After a weeklong trial, the jury rejected claims against five of the seven defendants but was unable to reach a verdict on the other two -- a prison psychiatrist and the prison's head of internal investigations. Mr. Blucker's claims against those two are scheduled to be retried this week.

VAs the House this week considers a measure to reauthorize Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, among the most interested onlookers will be the private freight rail companies, which could benefit greatly from an obscure provision in the bill. That item, inserted by members of the House Transportation Committee, would limit for the first time the amount of damages companies like CSX and the Union Pacific Corporation could incur for people injured by the companies' negligence -- even if it was deliberate. And, even more important, those costs would be paid in most cases by Amtrak and ultimately the public treasury.

VGov. Christine Todd Whitman and State Senator James E. McGreevey clashed over property taxes and automobile insurance rates tonight during their second televised debate as they each sought to portray themselves as the champions of homeowners and drivers. In Whippany, during the one-hour debate, Mrs. Whitman put on a feisty defense of her record and delivered well-mannered but sharp attacks on Mr. McGreevey, her Democratic opponent, lambasting his plan to reduce auto insurance rates and his votes in the Legislature to support tax increases. ''The only fraud in auto insurance right now is within the Senator's proposal because he knows that the 10 percent rollback simply can't happen,'' Mrs. Whitman said.

VJudge Harold J. Rothwax, who began his legal career as a combative defense lawyer and civil rights advocate in New York but who later gained wide attention in a campaign to limit the rights of defendants, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 67. The cause was complications from a stroke that he suffered on Sept. 6, said Nicholas Scoppetta, the Commissioner of the city's Administration for Children's Services and a friend of Judge Rothwax.

VThe director of the United Nations anti-narcotics organization said today that the militant Islamic movement that controls most of Afghanistan had agreed to enforce a ban on opium poppy production and smuggling with the help of international crime-fighting organizations. The official, Under Secretary General Pino Arlacchi, said in an interview that the agreement with the Taliban, who seized power in Kabul in September 1996, had taken six months to negotiate.

VContrary to the wholesome image marketed by the National Basketball Association, 60 to 70 percent of its 350-plus players smoke marijuana and drink excessively, according to conversations with more than two dozen players, former players, agents and basketball executives. ''If they tested for pot, there would be no league,'' said Richard Dumas, the former Phoenix Suns guard who was banned from the league for drug and alcohol use and is now playing in Europe. ''Weed is something guys grow up doing, and there's no reason for them to stop. Because almost everyone does it, no one wants to test for it. They're afraid to.''

VWhile the popularity of marijuana and other drugs appears to be leveling off among older high school students, more of their younger brothers and sisters are experimenting with illicit drugs, according to the country's largest survey of adolescent drug use. The findings released yesterday by Pride, an organization based in Atlanta that works with schools and parents to discourage youthful drug use, contradicts some major findings in an earlier annual survey for the Department of Health and Human Services. The Government study, called the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, reported in August that the number of teen-agers using drugs in the previous month had dropped to 9 percent in 1996, from 10.9 percent in 1995.

VThe White House's drug policy director, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, argued today before sometimes skeptical Senators that the best hope of stopping illegal drugs from crossing the southwestern border lies in helping Mexico reform its corrupt police and weak legal systems, rather than merely criticizing their flaws. Testifying at a joint session of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, General McCaffrey said the Administration's strategy of working in partnership with Mexico to fight drugs was beginning to reap benefits.

VAmong the high moments, low moments and many, many embarrassing moments in the young life of ''CBS News Saturday Morning,'' the breakfast souffle for which Susan Molinari left a seat in Congress, one of the more telling came when Michael Riera, a family therapist, spoke on the show about the self-consciousness of teen-agers. If ''you go to a classic high school,'' Riera told Molinari and her buttery co-anchor, Russ Mitchell, ''all the kids are working hard to look relaxed and cool.'' Molinari picked up the cue, although perhaps not in the way her producers had planned. ''We try and do that here,'' she ad-libbed cheerfully. ''Some of us are still struggling with that, Michael.''

VA state Superior Court judge last week blocked Ridgefield Park from randomly testing its student athletes for drugs until the district can show in court that drugs are indeed a widespread problem. Judge Sybil R. Moses ruled in Hackensack on Tuesday that affidavits by coaches and players attesting to marijuana and other drug use contained hearsay, and ordered that direct testimony be given some time this spring. The case is believed to be the first challenge to such testing in New Jersey, where a handful of schools engage in the practice. James Katz, a lawyer arguing the case for the state American Civil Liberties Union, said the testing violated privacy rights guaranteed by the state constitution. Alisa Jacobson, a lawyer for the district, said, ''Obviously, we think it's constitutional.''

VTo the Sports Editor: Regarding marijuana usage among professional athletes (''N.B.A.'s Uncontrolled Substance,'' The Times, Oct. 26), National Basketball Association Commissioner David Stern gives readers the false impression that marijuana causes ''muscle deterioration'' and lengthens the recovery time from injuries. To the contrary, marijuana is a muscle relaxant and an anesthetic that may actually reduce the time in which players can return to action. Many are probably self-medicating for chronic pain and stress. Some may even believe (mistakenly) that marijuana enhances their ability to prepare for a game and to concentrate on the field. Solid scientific research is called for on the effects of marijuana use on competitive sports players -- in combination with alcohol and other drugs, but also by itself.

VLee (Scratch) Perry had a lot on his mind on Friday night at Wetlands. During his two-and-a-half-hour set, Mr. Perry discoursed on Jah Rastafari and Jesus, Krishna and Moses, space aliens and marijuana, poverty and the International Monetary Fund, computers, supermarkets and sex. For much of his career, the 61-year-old Mr. Perry has been a wordless presence as the producer of some of the most influential recordings in 20th-century pop. Brilliant and famously eccentric, Mr. Perry once put a microphone on a palm tree to capture what he considered the living African heartbeat. His productions are full of echoes and distortions, sudden noises and disorienting absences, and they have influenced not only reggae but hip-hop, rock and all sorts of dance music.

VKANSAS CITY Quarterback Elvis Grbac, who rejuvenated the Chiefs' offense in just half a season, will be out for at least a month with a broken collarbone. Grbac was slammed to the ground Monday night in the fourth quarter of Kansas City's 13-10 victory over Pittsburgh. After lying motionless for several minutes, he rose and walked off the field in pain, and the Chiefs confirmed yesterday that he had broken his left collarbone.

VOregon voters refused yesterday to repeal the country's only law allowing doctor-assisted suicide, first passed three years ago but never put into effect because of a series of legal and political challenges. With more than half the state's precincts reporting, the repeal effort, one of more than 50 ballot initiatives decided across the country in the day's voting, was going down to defeat by a ratio of better than 3 to 2, according to The Associated Press.

VIn a scandal that will further damage a sport already hurt by poor performances and monetary problems, nine weight lifters have been suspended from a residence program at the Olympic training center in Colorado Springs for allegedly using banned substances, weight lifting officials said last night. The dismissals, which occurred on Oct. 17 and 18, were made public in a recent letter sent to weight lifting clubs around the country by George Greenway, executive director of USA Weightlifting, the national governing body. Mike Moran, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, confirmed last night that some weight lifters had been dismissed from the training center, although he did not know the exact number.

VDisappointed supporters of a $2.4 billion statewide school construction initiative may be wondering how it went down to defeat when New York City residents, the bulk of the state's voters on Tuesday, supported it by a margin of over 70 percent. The answer is simple. That was 70 percent of those who actually voted on the school bond act, but most city voters didn't address the issue. They couldn't find it on their ballots. Indeed, the wonder is that anyone managed to locate the proposal on a ballot that looked like an electoral version of ''Where's Waldo?'' Not only were all four statewide questions stacked on the far right, they were squashed amid a raft of little-known independent candidates for various offices. In Manhattan, for instance, voters could find the school construction proposal and a referendum on the constitutional convention stuck in between a line for the Fusion Party candidate for Comptroller and the Marijuana Green candidate for Borough President.

VMELVA Max, almost prim in a black-and-white houndstooth wool suit, sat in a back row of Midtown Community Court on West 54th Street last week trading war stories with a fellow defendant, a young man who had been arrested while smoking marijuana on the street. He seemed sheepish; the last one of four on a toke, why didn't he have the sense to throw it away when the cops showed up? But he shook his head in sympathetic indignation when he heard her story. Sometime after midnight on Friday, Oct. 10, Ms. Max says, she stopped a Tenth Precinct patrol car outside her restaurant, La Lunchonette, on the corner of Tenth Avenue and 18th Street and asked a sergeant to do something about the motorycle noise caused by patrons of a nearby bar. A few minutes later, Ms. Max, a 40-year-old mother of two, was up against the patrol car, her hands cuffed behind her, charged with obstruction of justice, harassing an officer and disorderly conduct. If there hadn't been a witness, and if her husband the chef, Jean-Francois Fraysse, hadn't shown up after she'd been strip-searched at the station house, she might not have been let free just before 4 A.M. with a desk appearance ticket returnable Nov. 12.

VRABBI KHAIMOV stood at his apartment window in Corona, Queens, salsa music rumbling from his radio. Upstairs, a dozen South Asian cab drivers came and went in shifts. One particular man likes to lift weights in the middle of the night, keeping the rabbi and his wife from sleeping. ''I cannot take this 'boom, boom,' '' the rabbi said, pounding the ceiling with a broom handle. The noise returned like Morse code. ''I must leave this place,'' he said, pulling at his chin. ''Maybe I never should have come.''

VShe was only 17, but four years on the streets of El Barrio had made her hard. Friends said the young runaway had drifted from bed to bed, from man to man. One had slashed her face, another had knocked out her front teeth. Three cigarette burns on her arm signified her only loyalty, to the Bloods gang. She dressed, talked and fought like a thug. She smoked dope and always needed cash. A month ago, however, the chaotic existence of Marta Nelson turned a corner. A new boyfriend, Israel Jose Perez, had come along, treating her with respect. He tried to expand her East Harlem horizons with ventures to Greenwich Village, SoHo and Central Park. She moved in with him. He got her away from marijuana and urged her to abandon her gang and get into a school program for dropouts.

VThe single-page form, titled ''Request for medication to end my life in a humane and dignified manner,'' is circulating now in the only state ever to legalize assisted suicide. But whether doctors in Oregon will actually do what the law allows them to is suddenly clouded by a threat from Washington. Acting on a request from two Republican members of Congress who oppose the Oregon law, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration has warned that doctors here who prescribe drugs to help terminally ill patients kill themselves could face severe sanctions.

VThis suburb of about 190,000 people hardly looks like a place where young people regularly die of heroin. Plano, 20 miles north of Dallas's forlorn downtown, is all big and new, with similar sprawling houses crammed side by side. It is a modern Texas boom town, having grown from a population of under 4,000 in 1960. People move here to avoid inner-city schools and urban crime. Many arrived for well-paying jobs at companies like the computer services concern EDS, which has its headquarters here. In 1989, Plano's median household income of $53,905 beat the national figure of $30,056 by 79 percent.

VNew York City police officers will be permitted to wear their uniforms while working off duty in a pilot program to start in February, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday. Under the plan, the Police Department will assign officers who request off-duty work to private employers, said Marilyn Mode, the department's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information. The officers, who will be paid overtime rates of about $26 an hour, will typically provide security for private businesses.

VCHURCH ATTENDANCE IS down, and people seem to be searching for religion anywhere but in the pews, yet Hollywood is experiencing a religious revival this fall with a total of four prime-time television shows about the clergy. It is no coincidence that in its own hackneyed way, the television industry seems to be grasping for God. The success of last season's ''Touched by an Angel,'' now television's second-highest rated drama after ''E.R.,'' has set off a new crusade.

VFor nearly five years, the New York City Medical Marijuana Buyers' Club has successful navigated the gray area between the shady drug dealers who are its suppliers and the police, whom the group has been careful to avoid encountering or provoking. By keeping relatively secretive and nomadic, the club thought it had built a peaceable existence to match its ostensibly altruistic purpose: to provide the drug and its physical comforts to those suffering from AIDS, cancer and other disabling diseases. That seeming peace came to an end on Tuesday night, club officials say, when two armed gunmen burst into an apartment just north of City Hall as volunteers were finishing selling marijuana to a group of new members. Johann Moore, the founder of the group, said the men, who wore ski masks, had ordered about 12 people to lie down and stole $5,700 worth of marijuana and cash.

VAnne Drennan, a Police Department spokeswoman in Vancouver, B.C., frankly says that ''Vancouver is known for having the highest-grade marijuana in the world,'' adding that busting potheads ''is not a priority with us.'' This climate has given rise to places like Hemp B.C., a Vancouver head shop that features an attached eatery and smokery called the Cannabis Cafe. The cafe is one of North America's only pot bars that allows any adult -- not just ''medicinal'' users -- to smoke openly, and the place isn't shy about this technically illegal arrangement. In fact, in full-page newspaper ads that ran recently, it invited delegates in town for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation trade forum to drop by for a freebie. Here's what awaited the curious. What You See ''Welcome to Hemp B.C.,'' reads a handwritten greeting, adding: ''... we request that you be 18 or older to smoke pot. Thank you.'' The head shop and cafe sit in the historic Gastown neighborhood, and feature bongs of many colors and a painting of the Virgin Mary clutching cannabis leaves. Marijuana is not for sale in the cafe, though giveaways are common. Each table is set with a domed vaporizer, which cooks rather than burns the pot for a vapory hit of THC mist.

VThe surging stock market has spawned widespread investment fraud across the country, with New York as the epicenter of the problem, according to law enforcement officials and securities regulators. The fraud involves the sale of marginal companies' low-priced stocks to amateur investors who are besieged by telephone sales calls. While the victims are usually told that the company in question is the next Microsoft or McDonald's, the shares they buy often turn out to be worthless.

VOn the blustery shore of Lake Ontario, in Canada's most heavily populated region, four aging nuclear reactors bedeviled by leaks, failures and operators who sometimes drank beer or smoked marijuana on the job are being shut down because they cannot be safely run by one of the largest utility companies in North America. At the same time, workers are busy excavating a huge site in China, about 60 miles south of Shanghai, where two Canadian reactors similar to the troubled ones in Canada are being built under Canadian supervision.

VA junior high school teacher in Queens hit two police officers while being arrested Monday night on charges of driving a stolen van and then tried to bribe the officers to drop the charges, the police said yesterday. They added that drugs and a prostitute were in the van. The teacher, Albert P. Lewis, 33, was spotted driving the stolen green Dodge Caravan near his home in Flushing, Queens, about 7:30 P.M. Monday, said Officer Joseph Cavitolo, a department spokesman. He said that when the officers tried to stop Mr. Lewis, he shoved, punched and kicked both officers, leaving one with a sprained wrist and the other with a sprained shoulder.

VAfter 13 years, 10 months and 12 days in prison, two Alabama brothers walked free on Tuesday after DNA tests indicated that they were wrongfully convicted of raping and kidnapping a woman in 1983. The two men, Dale E. Mahan, 36, and Ronnie B. Mahan, 50, spent their first hours of freedom catching up with relatives, telephoning old friends, and savoring the long-forgotten tastes of cheeseburgers, french fries and Coca-Cola. As with many former inmates, they took note of the trivial liberties that others take for granted: the forks and knives at the dinner table, the jingle of loose change in their pockets.

But Mr. Williams said he never imagined that his most formidable problem would be the New Jersey Department of Education. For most of his short tenure, the Superintendent has been battling the State Education Commissioner, Leo F. Klagholz, over his plan to put a middle school in a vacant high school building.

VThe Federal and local authorities around the nation announced today that they had smashed one of the largest methamphetamine networks in the United States. They also said the operation had resulted in the arrest of 100 suspects and the breaking up of a ring that had been a major American contractor of Mexico's largest methamphetamine gang. Top officials in Washington said the arrests were a significant breakthrough in their fight against the proliferating trade in methamphetamine, or ''speed.'' Once used largely by motorcycle gangs, methamphetamine has replaced crack as the drug of choice in many parts of the United States. The drug's popularity has slowly spread from the Southwest, where it was easily and cheaply obtainable from Mexican sources, to the Midwest and, more recently, to states in the East and Southeast.

VAs Congress prepares to consider landmark legislation intended to reduce underage tobacco use, a growing number of states, cities and schools are taking measures to crack down on what they see as a major cause of the problem: young people themselves. Over the past year, states like Florida, Idaho, Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas have passed laws that could result in stiff penalties for minors who try to buy or possess cigarettes or chewing tobacco. Those convicted of such offenses could lose their driver's licenses, face fines of up to $1,000 or even be imprisoned for up to six months.

VSTATES AND CITIES IMPOSE NEW LAWS ON YOUNG SMOKERS

ssVabstract
p62037
VAs Congress weighs landmark legislation intended to reduce underage tobacco use, growing number of cities and schools are taking measures to crack down on what they see as major cause of problem, namely, young people themselves; over past year, Florida, Idaho, Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas have passed laws that could result in stiff penalties for minors who try to buy or possess cigarettes or chewing tobacco; some cities are using undercover police officers to catch youths who smoke, and some schools tha test students for illegal substances are also screening them for nicotine; new measures follow failure of repeated efforts in recent years to use educational programs and other measures to halt growth in number of minors who use tobacco; while many anti-smoking advocates support toughened approach, others see new state laws, many of which are backed by tobacco industry, as draconian response to custom that was once teen-age rite of passage; photo (M)

VTHE rallying cry among young drinkers used to be a rousing ''Party Hearty!'' Increasingly, it is now a sobering ''Party Hardly,'' especially after the alcohol-related death of a Port Chester college student earlier this year, the suspension of high school athletes in Harrison and Peekskill this fall and recent drinking fatalities at college campuses nationwide. ''There has to be a better way,'' said a worried Shannon Fogarty, president of the Greek Council at Iona College, which represents 14 sororities and fraternities on the New Rochelle campus. ''We've got to change things.''

The coffee maker burbled, Ms. Rose's daughters, 8 and 10, played a boisterous game of Monopoly, and her 11-year-old son goofed around with a whoopee cushion. As her husband cooked up a huge pot of spaghetti in the kitchen, Ms. Rose collapsed on the sofa, wiping her brow, a proud smile on her face as she watched the children play.

VA state appeals court ruled today that the police can close marijuana buyers' clubs despite a state law that makes it legal to use marijuana for medicinal purposes. If allowed to operate, such clubs would set a precedent for ''marijuana to be sold as a loss leader or at cost in co-ops, grocery stores, liquor stores etc., or to be provided on a complimentary basis at bars, restaurants, nightclubs or casinos,'' said the ruling from the First District Court of Appeals. It held that Proposition 215, which was approved by voters in 1996 and which permitted the medical use of marijuana, did not legalize such groups.

This is the South Bronx that Ellen Rodriguez sees, and she wishes President Clinton had seen it, too. ''Just too bad he didn't come around to this area so he could see the way some of these people really live,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, who works at La Casita, a residence for mothers recovering from drug addiction on 156th Street near Prospect. ''It's just sad to see.''

VFour and a half years ago an Indonesian mariner named Amir Humuntal Lumban Tobing was at the center of one of the most notorious smuggling cases in recent American history. He was the captain of the Golden Venture, the decrepit freighter that was run aground off Queens in June 1993 with nearly 300 illegal Chinese immigrants aboard, 10 of whom drowned or died from hypothermia after they swam toward shore while virtually all the rest were quickly seized.

VIn a sedate, upper-middle-class neighborhood here, where streets carry the names of Methodist bishops, young Mat thaeus Reinhart Jaehnig grew up in a large neo-Georgian brick house and attended a private school that nurtured freethinking. The household was headed by his father, a cerebral pastor whose pacifism dated from a childhood in war-ravaged Germany. Last month, at the age of 25, Mr. Jaehnig burst into Denver's consciousness as a drugged-out skinhead who stole a red Pontiac Trans-Am, led the police on a wild 30-mile chase, killed a police officer in a blaze of automatic weapon fire and then committed suicide.

VOn the surface, the Federal law known as Section 924(c) looks about as simple and straightforward as legislation ever gets: it uses plain English, no legal jargon, not even any big words. It imposes a mandatory five-year prison sentence on anyone who ''uses or carries a firearm'' while committing a drug crime or crime of violence. Yet that simple phrase, ''uses or carries,'' has spawned years of litigation in the Federal courts, producing multiple shades of meaning. Two years ago, the Supreme Court finally resolved the meaning of the word ''use.'' To come within the statute, the Court ruled unanimously in a 1995 opinion, Bailey v. United States, a gun had to be actively deployed, not just left sitting in a closet or nightstand drawer.

VA state appeals court ruled on Friday that the police could close marijuana buyers' clubs despite a state law that made it legal to use marijuana for medicinal purposes. Such clubs would set a precedent for ''marijuana to be sold as a loss leader or at cost in co-ops, grocery stores, liquor stores etc., or to be provided on a complimentary basis at bars, restaurants, nightclubs or casinos,'' said the ruling from the First District Court of Appeals. It held that Proposition 215, which was approved by voters in 1996 and which permitted the medical use of marijuana, did not legalize such groups.

VWhen the Wailers began in 1961, they included Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Junior Braithwaite and Neville O'Riley Livingston, who renamed himself Bunny Wailer. Mr. Braithwaite left the group in 1965; Marley and Tosh died in the 1980's. That leaves Bunny Wailer, who quit the Wailers in 1973, as the sole claimant to the Wailers' legacy. At the Beacon Theater on Sunday night, he treated that legacy as three elements: dance music, songs of liberation and Rastafarian gospel music, none entirely separate from the others. No matter what the message was, it arrived with an ebullient groove. Mr. Wailer left the Wailers in part because he didn't like touring, and he rarely leaves Jamaica, where he became a consistent hit maker in the 1980's. He performed in New York City in 1986 and returned only this year. Mr. Wailer won a Grammy Award in 1990 for ''Time Will Tell,'' one of his albums of Marley songs, and the Beacon show was billed as a tribute to Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. He did sing a few Wailers songs -- ''Simmer Down,'' ''Crazy Baldhead'' and ''No Woman No Cry'' -- as well as Mr. Tosh's ''Legalize It.'' But most of the concert was devoted to Mr. Wailer's own repertory. His songwriting has eroded in the 1990's, but the set featured material from the 80's, when Mr. Wailer came up with songs of resistance like ''Rise and Shine'' and ''Serious Thing'' along with more lighthearted songs like ''Rock 'n' Groove'' and ''Cool Runnings.''

VTwo prison guards and two recreation workers at the Federal prison at Fort Dix were arrested yesterday on charges of taking bribes from inmates to smuggle drugs, alcohol and other contraband into the prison, Federal prosecutors said. The four correction officers were charged with taking a total of at least $3,100 from January to October to obtain the smuggled items, which included marijuana, steroids, gym sneakers, cigars, weight-loss pills and skin cream, said Stuart Rabner, an assistant United States attorney.

VThough older high school students are reportedly still smoking marijuana in increasing numbers, their flirtation with other illegal drugs appears to be slowing, and drug use among eighth graders has stopped climbing for the first time in more than five years. The findings, compiled by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and announced by President Clinton yesterday, offered the first encouraging evidence since 1992 that adolescent drug use, which started rebounding months before he moved into the White House, could be leveling off.

VIf it is 10 P.M., Winnie Coppage knows exactly where her three grandchildren are. ''Once it's dark, they're in here with me,'' she said, flashing them a tough-love glare. ''They have no business being on the streets with all that shooting, stealing and drugging.'' Sitting on the floor of their apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, the girls, Nefertiti, 15, and Shakemha, 11, scribbled poetry in their notebooks while Jonathan, 9, stared at the television set, his cheeks stuffed with potato chips. Darkness was settling over Gates Avenue and a group of junkies had already begun huddling downstairs under the awning of a corner bodega.

The prosecutor, Arthur Green Jr., an assistant district attorney in Jefferson County, said he planned to proceed despite a new admission by the victim that she had sex on the day she said she was raped with both her husband and a boyfriend. What is more, preliminary DNA test results show that the semen found in the woman's vagina and on her clothing came from the boyfriend.

VThere had been a report of gunfire crackling from a rooftop, and the police had swarmed to the Glenwood Houses in Canarsie, Brooklyn. Guns were drawn, including that of Officer Michael J. Davitt, 36, who in 14 years on the force had fired eight times, shot two people and been sent down twice for weapons retraining. Danger swirled in the wintry air. All at once, William J. Whitfield, 22, who was wanted on minor assault and marijuana charges but who was not armed and apparently had had nothing to do with any shooting in the area, came out to find a pay phone and arrange to take his fiancee and their children to his mother's home for Christmas dinner.

VThe police officer who shot an unarmed man in a Brooklyn grocery store on Christmas Day will not give his account to detectives before Wednesday at the earliest, investigators said yesterday as protests over the slaying grew and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani urged New Yorkers to refrain from premature judgment. Apparently seeking to avoid procedural errors in a politically volatile case, investigators were in no hurry to talk to Officer Michael J. Davitt about the shooting of William J. Whitfield, 22, in the Milky Way, at 1669 Ralph Avenue in Canarsie shortly after 1 P.M. on Thursday.

VSheila Corrales has a Park Avenue address and enjoys expansive views from her 14th-floor apartment. ''Sounds fancy,'' she said. ''But believe me, it's not.'' That is because the Corrales family lives on Park Avenue at 102d Street, a neighborhood that boasts more drug dealers than doormen. At night, gunfire often jars Mrs. Corrales awake and sends her scrambling around in the dark to check on her three children. When she walks through the lobby of the George Washington Carver Houses with Nicole, 13, Sarah, 9, and Roger Jr., 6, the smell of marijuana smoke is sometimes overpowering.

VIT's Christmas Day just after dusk, and at a corner delicatessen on Avenue D things seem pretty bleak. Crudely taped-on posters and boxes of laundry detergent block out most of the windows, and paint peels in strips from the tin awning. The lights in the glassed refrigerators are off, and dusty cans of dog food and soup sit untouched on the shelves. A few customers breeze in and out, but most of the business seems to consist of 10-cent candies and the occasional cigar.

VSOCIAL historians, seeking clues to the mindset of an age, have been known to scrutinize court and marriage records, myths and fairy tales and even humor. With the city's image cleaner now, the question had been raised: has that cranky and bilious institution known as the New York Joke mellowed? Not really, according to an examination of jokes produced upon our request by David Letterman's monologue writers. There is little mercy therein, proving that asking a comedy writer to surrender a wicked touch is like taking the sword from a samurai.

VHoping to build a new bulwark against the flow of illegal drugs from Latin America, the United States is providing the Mexican military with extensive covert intelligence support and training hundreds of its officers to help shape a network of anti-drug troops around the country, United States and Mexican officials say. The officials say the assistance has included training, equipment and advice from the Central Intelligence Agency to establish an elite army intelligence unit that has quietly moved to the forefront of Mexico's anti-drug effort, sometimes ahead of a new civilian police force that the United States is also pledged to support.

VOn the morning after Times Square held a New Year's Eve party for 500,000 revelers, the neighborhood seemed subdued, but hardly hung over. Where hordes had battled for breathing room, mothers pushed strollers and teen-agers cruised by on Rollerblades. Pigeons pecked at pretzels left along the sidewalks, and enough confetti remained in the air to mark the launching of the Titanic.

VThe comedian Chris Farley died of an overdose of cocaine and morphine, the Cook County Medical Examiner said today. A significant contributing factor, the examiner said, was a narrowing of the arteries supplying the heart muscle. Mr. Farley's body was found on Dec. 18 on the floor of his apartment here. The police said they found no sign of foul play or drugs in the apartment.

VGetting in to see John Casteen III is no easy matter. As president of the University of Virginia, one of the nation's premier colleges, he is often on the road, raising money for a $750 million capital fund drive that does not end until the year 2000. When he is on campus, he is tightly scheduled. Early in the morning, appointments begin to back up in the elegant waiting room outside his Madison Hall office. Alumni, faculty, undergraduates, doctoral candidates, state legislators, bankers, the student reporter from The Cavalier Daily -- they all want a few minutes. But one afternoon in early December, the busy president abruptly canceled his appointments and drove two hours from the Charlottesville campus to Reston in northern Virginia, to visit the parents of Leslie Baltz, an honors student in the Class of '98. President Casteen makes these visits once or twice a year, though he is never sure if the parents will want to see him, given the circumstances.

VPracticality has been a feature of American life from the start, and a reason for the country's success. Americans on the whole eschewed ideology. We judged ideas by whether they worked. When they didn't, we tried something else. A strange contemporary exception to that tradition is the war on drugs. By any rational test it is an overwhelming failure. Yet our leading politicians persist in calling for ever more stringent measures to enforce the policy of total prohibition, doing their best to prevent even a discussion of alternatives.

VRick James savored every minute he was onstage at Tramps on Saturday night. He was touring for the first time since he served a three-year jail sentence for assaulting a woman, and he was performing in New York City for the first time since 1991. He sang a song he wrote for the Temptations, ''Standing on the Top,'' about how fleeting fame can be, and he wasn't shy about mentioning his former cocaine addiction or alluding to his jail time. ''But I'm back again,'' he insisted, and he set out to remind the audience just what made him a multimillion-selling star in the late 1970's and early 80's: crisp, irresistible grooves and songs about sex and getting stoned. The crowd that packed the club had not forgotten. All Mr. James had to do was cue the bass riff of ''You and I'' or ''Bustin' Out,'' and the audience was singing along, shouting verses as well as choruses. Every so often, Mr. James would stop the band while fans kept the songs going. His blatantly bawdy hits were dance music and make-out music during the last gasp of 1970's hedonism, before AIDS and crack were in the news; now, they hold nostalgia for an era of pleasure without risks, while their snappy grooves are still being recycled in hip-hop. M.C. Hammer's huge hit ''U Can't Touch This'' was built on Mr. James's signature song, ''Super Freak.''

VRaheem Dawkins, a 16-year-old from Brownsville, Brooklyn, does volunteer community service at his local police precinct and wants to be a police officer. So when he saw an off-duty officer being attacked in a Manhattan subway station early on New Year's morning, he didn't hesitate; he jumped in to help. But as Mr. Dawkins tried to pull the attacker away, the officer opened fire and shot his would-be savior.

VRaheem Dawkins, 16, was shot by police officer he was trying to protect from attacker, then described in police report as 'possible suspect'; incident occurred in Manhattan subway station on New Year's morning; Dawkins, seriously wounded, lay in hospital for week before police spokesman, answering reporter's query, acknowledged that Dawkins was in fact trying to aid officer when he was shot; Deputy Inspector Michael Collins says police failed to inform news organizations about incident, apparently because of procedural error; but before department's acknowledgment that Dawkins was hero, not villain, some investigators expressed dismay over handling of case; say police are embarrassed that good Samaritan got shot; photo (M)

VTo the Editor: Anthony Lewis (column, Jan. 5) states that the country's war on drugs is ''an overwhelming failure.'' But it is not a failure that cocaine and crack use have dropped. In fact, it is a reason cited to explain the drop in crime across the country. Nor is it a failure that even with a rise in marijuana use the past few years, adolescent marijuana use is still lower than in the peak years of the late 1970's.

VEight days after being shot by an off-duty police officer he was trying to save from a beating or worse, a 16-year-old police buff was visited at his hospital bedside by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and praised as a good Samaritan in a case in which he was initially viewed as a possible suspect. ''We wanted to give him something to show our appreciation,'' the Mayor said after meeting the youth, Raheem Dawkins, at St. Vincent's Hospital and giving him a Police Department cap. ''As soon as he recovers we will do something for him at City Hall, give him some official recognition of his acting as a good Samaritan.''

VWhen it opened in late 1994 as a cafe by day and a hipster bar by night, Nation was almost immediately praised by customers as one of those strangely appealing New York hybrids. Nation, at 50 Avenue A, was a place that could serve a frothy cappuccino in the morning and afternoon and offer a chilled martini and a cool disk jockey when the sun went down. The police say it was also a pothead's paradise, where patrons could buy and smoke marijuana in the confines of the loungy back room.

Morris admitted to missing seven meetings with his probation officer since going on deferred adjudication in June 1996. But he denied two other allegations and, as part of a plea bargain, was punished for four months instead of a possible 10 years.

VThe great Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist, that modern-day yarn of all Boston yarns, that real-life clash between the snobbish Bostonians of Henry James and the thuggish friends of Eddie Coyle, squeezes easily into a nutshell: Once there was a flamboyant moneybags patroness who collected oodles of fine art in a turn-of-the-century palazzo by the marshy Fenway. In 1990, thieves dressed as police officers invaded the palazzo-museum and pulled off the biggest art theft in American history, snatching 11 paintings now valued at perhaps $300 million. Despite Herculean efforts, the authorities have never recovered them.

VHE had marvelous hands, magical hands. DeWitt White grew up poor in a Bronx neighborhood where piano lessons, not to mention pianos, were in short supply. But at 12, he discovered classical music and a prodigious talent for playing it. By 15, he had played in student performances at Carnegie Hall, Columbia University, the New York Botanical Garden, performed so beautifully that he silenced and shamed those who judged him by his baggy jeans, his wild hair, his dark skin. He was raw, but his playing had a power, a passion, that portended greatness.

VJimmy Chang moved to Camden last fall, taking over the family takeout restaurant just as the nighttime gatherings near his corner were winnowing down to what some people here call the ''children of the night.'' And there they remain on freezing January nights -- drug dealers and their customers, girlfriends and hangers-on -- picking up chicken wings and fried rice until the metal grates come down at 1 or 2 A.M. Mr. Chang also arrived, it turns out, just in time to walk into a constitutional question. After many months of public complaints and one false start, the Camden City Council narrowly passed an ordinance this month requiring food-service businesses that do not have seating for at least 15 people to close at midnight -- the goal being to deprive people like Mr. Chang's customers of their dead-of-night hangouts. And a group of restaurant owners is challenging the measure in court, contending that the city is punishing them unfairly in its endless war on drugs.

VIn his bid to become the top Federal prosecutor in the Southern District of Texas, Roland Garcia Jr. presents some impressive credentials. He is a partner in a prestigious law firm here, a director of the Houston Bar Association and a past president of the Hispanic Bar Association. The Democratic members of Congress in the Southern District have officially recommended him for the post. But with his name now before President Clinton, the 39-year-old Mr. Garcia is finding his campaign for the United States Attorney's job clouded by something he neglected to disclose, at least initially, to the Congressmen here: His younger brother is in Federal prison, convicted of involvement in drug-running and of the murder of an associate who crossed him on a deal.

VWith a toughly worded speech designed to frame both the legislative session and his re-election campaign, Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday ridiculed the notion that societal factors were to blame for violent crime and pledged to push for bills this year that would make it easier to imprison and, in some cases, execute criminals. Speaking to a group of district attorneys in Manhattan, Mr. Pataki described as ''nonsense'' the argument that a criminal's actions stemmed from ''a culmination of social factors beyond his control.''

VThere is no lock on the gate leading to the courtyard for the apartments at 253 East 77th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, a fact that tenants there feel anxious in mentioning because it may be an open invitation to criminals. But, they say, they are tired of schoolchildren smoking marijuana in the courtyard, homeless people defecating in hallways and strangers doing private business, possibly drug deals, in the courtyard's blind spots. And they are tired of what, they say, is the landlord's dragging her feet in installing the lock.

The White House has maintained that Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign denial of an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers was ''not at odds'' with the testimony he offered under oath on Jan. 17 in his deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit.

VAt the Sundance Film Festival, where young white audiences predominate and much of this year's emphasis was on antic white characters having trouble with their love lives, two big winners were films about black men in prison. Top dramatic honors went to Marc Levin's ''Slam,'' made in a muscular documentary style and featuring a strong performance from Saul Williams, who plays a young man from the ghetto who is jailed on a marijuana charge. Punctuated by tough, galvanizing outbursts of rap poetry, ''Slam'' tells a not entirely unpredictable story in newly energetic fashion. In this year's much stronger documentary category, a Grand Jury Prize went to ''The Farm,'' a lucid and affecting look at life inside America's largest maximum-security prison. Filmed in Angola, La., by Jonathan Stack and Liz Garbus over the course of a year, it concentrates closely on six inmates and their varied problems. In a radical change of pace, ''The Farm'' shared this prize with ''Frat House,'' by Todd Phillips and Andrew Gurland, a cool look at the staggering stupidity, obscenity and brutishness of fraternity hazing, with one of the filmmakers even experiencing Hell Week firsthand. ''And after going through it, one question still remains,'' he says as narrator: ''Why is it that some guys are so afraid of standing out that they are willing to do almost anything to fit in?''

Morris, 26, led the Ravens in rushing in each of the last two seasons but missed time both years while serving suspensions mandated by the National Football League for substance abuse. Morris, an unrestricted free agent, is serving a four-month jail term for violating probation in connection with his 1996 arrest for marijuana possession.

VA police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man in a Brooklyn grocery store last month was cleared of all criminal charges yesterday by a grand jury that found his actions justified under a law governing the use of deadly force, the Brooklyn District Attorney said. After hearing 24 witnesses -- 13 civilians and 11 police officers -- over three weeks in a case that had ignited protests and prompted a change in police procedure, the panel refused to indict Officer Michael J. Davitt in the death of William J. Whitfield, 22, in a confrontation in Canarsie on Christmas Day.

VBam Morris's story is one of those that makes anyone who has followed it shake his head. Sadly, it has become an all too common one in football, and in sports in general. In 1994, Morris was a rookie running back with the Pittsburgh Steelers. That season he rushed for over 800 yards -- 146 of them in a single game against the Giants.

VALWAYS IN PURSUIT Fresh American Perspectives, 1995-1997 By Stanley Crouch 321 pages. Pantheon Books. $25. What is appealing about the views of Stanley Crouch, a columnist for The New York Daily News and a jazz critic, is that he fully acknowledges the worst about the contemporary American scene yet remains deeply optimistic about the country's future.

VSteve Earle respects the country-music staples: road songs, love songs and outlaw songs. It's just that in his songs, the road usually leads nowhere, the outlaws get caught and the romances can be summed up with, as one song puts it, ''Nothing ventured, nothing lost.'' Often, Mr. Earle's music gives his words a buoyant backdrop, full of twangy guitar hooks and clear-cut choruses. But his voice -- a hoarse, crumbling rasp full of bitter experience -- offers no false comforts. Mr. Earle's set at Tramps on Wednesday night, the first of two sold-out nights, was roots-rock with widespread roots. In a generous set that stretched more than two hours, Mr. Earle played most of his new album, ''El Corazon'' (Warner Brothers), along with unflinching songs from his previous albums. Between songs, he alluded to the drug addiction he overcame in the mid-1990's and offered self-deprecating aphorisms. ''In affairs of the heart,'' he said, ''trust absolutely nobody, and least of all me.''

VAt a time when the public is clamoring for tougher school discipline, many educators across the nation are edging into the role of policing not just what goes on within their own buildings, but off-campus problems as well, from fistfights at the mall or sexual harassment on the school bus to drinking, smoking or drug use in students' homes. Many schools now have codes of conduct barring the use of alcohol, drugs or tobacco by athletes and others who participate in extracurricular activities. Many also have policies requiring suspension or expulsion when a student is arrested, and some intervene even when the police have not been contacted.

VTECHNOLOGY giveth and technology taketh away. The athletes of the Winter Games don't mind when the latest technology gives them clap skates that rocket them to faster times, nor do they mind when technology discovers ways to wax their skis for improved traction. But hey, dude, it's no fun when technology picks up a few extra nanograms of a controlled substance in the body of a gold-medal winner at the Winter Games. Then, technology is inhumane and cruel and capricious.

VTHEY owe the kid another ceremony. All the craven officials with their blazers and their badges and their bungled drug policies ought to summon Ross Rebagliati to Central Square one of these nights and bow down and kiss his medal in public and utter that traditional Japanese phrase, ''Gomen nasai.'' I am so sorry. They hung the kid out to dry, with their gibberish and their void. The blond dude won a gold medal in snowboarding and then had his name flashed around the world as the drug fiend from hell who tested positive for, good grief, cannabis. The federations and the associations made him fear for his gold medal, and forced him to ''cooperate,'' as the saying goes, with the Japanese police, which could not have been a lot of laughs, considering that the host country will slam you in jail or banish you for life for minimal amounts of dope.

VAsk Tricia Zwilinske why she used to smoke marijuana every day, why she failed all her classes or why rebellious behavior led to her being dismissed from four high schools and all she offers is a wan smile and a sheepish shrug. ''Everyone else was doing it,'' Tricia, 15, said haltingly as she played with her bangs. ''It was the thing to do.'' In some ways, Tricia managed better than many peers, some of whom became addicted to major drugs, gave up on school or ended up in jail. Her last boyfriend is in jail for dealing crack. In fact, none of her friends at Sheepshead Bay High School, she said, made it to graduation. ''Everyone is running wild,'' she said.

VBATTLE OF SURVIVAL -- Jean-Luc Cretier of France won the gold medal today in a men's downhill that may be remembered as much for those who fell as for those who won. After the event had been delayed for five days because of bad weather, 43 skiers started down the treacherous course, but only 28 finished it. Among the unfortunate was the Austrian star Hermann Maier, whose gold-medal hopes vanished in a spectacular crash in which he flipped 30 feet in the air and blew through two fences. But he walked away. Page C1. MEDAL RETURNED -- Ross Rebagliati, the Canadian snowboarder who had been disqualified after he tested positive for marijuana, will get to keep his gold medal after all. Page C2.

VThe juxtaposition may be unintentional, but the promotional spots for the Daytona 500 stock car race that CBS has been running throughout its coverage of the Winter Olympics have an uncanny similarity to many of the events in Nagano. Both are filled with crashes and collisions and the anxiety that someone is going to ruin a lifetime of training by making a disqualifying mistake. That may not provide the noblest of reasons to watch the Olympic competition, but after a week of viewing it is clear that the potential for crushing failure is one of the things that draws viewers to what can only be described as a collection of some of the world's oddest sports.

VWarning: These Olympics can cause severe disorientation, prompting such existential questions as ''When an event is delayed, and the telecast of that delay is delayed, does it all become 'live'?'' Take Thursday night. TV viewers knew the men's downhill skiing had been delayed for days by winter weather (what do they expect in winter?). But there, on prime time, it was delayed again. The previous night, after endless CBS teasing, viewers finally saw Picabo Street win the super giant slalom -- a victory they'd already read about in the morning paper. So this ''delay'' in the men's downhill had to be another tease, right? No, this time it was live.

VAs soon as golf's leading logos, Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, stepped up to the moral tee, the case of Casey Martin got interesting. Until then, it just seemed like a silly squabble over using a cart during the later rounds of tournament play. Sure he should use a cart, but who knew the subtext? Maybe country-club owners were concerned about their grass; maybe golfers who walked fast or carried their own clubs would want to be rewarded with strokes; maybe there was fear that the greens would be invaded by a new generation of pot-smoking turf-boarders and sand-lugers.

VIt was hardly a crime to attract much attention in a hard-bitten urban environment. Four teen-agers high on drugs and alcohol encountered two brothers, both around 30 and both drunk, in a tough neighborhood of St. Louis one November night in 1986. Name-calling, quarreling and a rumble ensued. Three of the youths took off with a few stolen dollars. Reginald L. Powell, at 18 the eldest of the attackers, stayed behind to finish off the victims with a knife.

VDuring the cold war, the Berlin Film Festival had loads of money and a strong political mission. Today it is hard up and struggling to find a new identity. Not that it has many options. At the world's main film festivals, business has long since supplanted art or even politics as the main concern. Berlin, it seems, has had little choice but to go commercial. As in recent years, the big American studios have again used Berlin as a European showcase for movies already released in the United States, among them ''Good Will Hunting,'' ''The Boxer,'' ''Jackie Brown,'' ''Wag the Dog'' and ''The Gingerbread Man.'' The festival provides the films with a good deal of free publicity, but they will all soon be in theaters here.

VBerlin Film Festival goes commercial since it no longer has the money and political mission it had during cold war; big American studios use festival this year to generate free publicity in Europe for movies already released in US; however, at least three new films are enthusiastically received by critics and audiences: Coen brothers' The Big Lebvowski, Neil Jordan's The Butcher Boy and Walter Salles's Central Station from Brazil; photos (M)

VA new salary cap and a new general manager have not changed the Giants' basic operating principle when it comes to dealing with its young, most promising players. Yesterday, the Giants locked up the All-Pro linebacker Jessie Armstead through the 2002 season, restructuring and extending the contract of the team's top defensive player with a five-year deal worth $15 million. The contract had four years remaining.

VTo the Editor: As an athlete who was subject to drug screening, I found George Vecsey too cavalier on Ross Rebagliati (column, Feb. 13). The rules on drugs are intended to prevent an unfair advantage and to protect the health of vulnerable athletes. Banning an athlete from smoking marijuana before careering down a mountain at high speed makes sense. This is true for other sports that require the agility and clear mind that drugs hamper.

VTo the Sports Editor: I was disturbed to read the comments of George Vecsey (''Snowboard Dude Says: No Big Deal,'' The Times, Feb. 13). Not only does he miss the mark on Ross Rebagliati, the snowboarder who used marijuana, but he vilifies International Olympic Committee officials who were upholding a sense of decency in an event intended to speak to our highest ideals and he trivializes the issue of drug use.

VILLEGAL drugs are a big problem for Garry M. Ritzky: too many of his job applicants use them. Mr. Ritzky, risk and human resources director for Turner Brothers Trucking Inc., a transportation and oil services company in Oklahoma City, is having a hard time finding candidates who are clean of cocaine, marijuana and heroin. ''We have an oil pipe operation that uses unskilled laborers, and we're seeing more positive drug tests,'' he said. ''We had three last week.'' The number of positive drug tests among applicants for low-skilled jobs at Turner Brothers has doubled in the last year, Mr. Ritzky added.

VFour men who accepted delivery of 700 pounds of marijuana from Mexico were arrested in the Bronx on Friday night, the police said. Acting on a tip from officials of the shipping company, Roadway Express Van Lines, who had become suspicious of the cargo, the authorities tracked the truck after it cleared customs in El Paso, Tex., and made the three-day trip to Brooklyn, said Lieut. Lebro Burnette of the Brooklyn North Narcotics Division. The marijuana in the truck had a street value of $4 million, the police said.

VTo the Sports Editor: Regarding his column about Ross Rebagliati: George Vecsey is way off base when describing Whistler, British Columbia. Whistler is far from a mecca for pot-smoking skiers and snowboarders. It is rather subdued and geared for the serious winter athlete. At Whistler, the happy hour is O.K., but by 10 P.M. during the week it's lights out. Although the locals do seem as if they were from an episode of ''Northern Exposure,'' everyone is friendly. If you visit the place, you'll only find majestic views and great skiing. DANIEL MALONEY Stamford, Conn.

VA Vermonter who had lived for a while in a back-to-nature community, Laura Kross was called to give a deposition when the Federal Government sued to take over the property on the ground that people were growing marijuana there. Ms. Kross lied; asked whether she had seen residents smoking marijuana on the property, she said, ''Uh-uh.'' For that, Ms. Kross was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced. In recalling the case, Gregory L. Waples, an Assistant United States Attorney in Vermont, said she had been prosecuted ''because she committed perjury.''

VAnton Rosenberg, a storied sometime artist and occasional musician who embodied the Greenwich Village hipster ideal of 1950's cool to such a laid-back degree and with such determined detachment that he never amounted to much of anything, died on Feb. 14 at a hospital near his home in Woodstock, N.Y. He was 71 and best known as the model for the character Julian Alexander in Jack Kerouac's novel ''The Subterraneans.'' The cause was cancer, his family said.

VIT seems like a very long time ago during the Edo Dynasty, I believe it was -- that I wrote that the 1998 Winter Games were now official because the Great Gretzky and the Mighty Kwan had arrived. Turns out I was barking up the wrong palm tree. (My guide book tells me there are palm trees right here in Nagano Prefecture. I never saw one, but maybe I was always sitting on the wrong side of a hellish number of press buses.)

VFOR nearly a decade, school districts throughout the state have been expelling students for behavior not on school property but nevertheless deemed by school boards to be ''seriously disruptive of the educational process.'' That aggressive use of a state policy sanctioned by the Attorney General's office in the late 1980's and put into law by the General Assembly two years ago is meant to allow schools to keep gang leaders, drug dealers and violent teen-agers out of classrooms and hallways. Under the policy, schools have had considerable discretion in expelling students for off-campus acts seen as endangering students and school staff. (It is generally accepted that schools have been able to expel students for disruptive behavior or criminal activity on school grounds.)

VAFTER having so much trouble at the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, because of snow, rain and slush, the last thing CBS needed was a problem with a swoosh. But it got one. Critics questioned CBS's decision to have its announcers for the games, who work for the sports division, wear ski jackets prominently displaying the swoosh, the internationally recognized symbol of Nike, the giant sports equipment and clothing manufacturer.

V''Where's Jelani? Where's Jelani? Where's Jelani?'' There were better places for the U.C.L.A. Bruins to appear this afternoon than Cameron Indoor Stadium. The Duke students, the Cameron Crazies, do not recognize privacy when opponents pass through these doors. So the absence of Jelani McCoy, the former Bruin center who attributed his resignation from the team a week ago to news media scrutiny, was treated with a different spin.

VThe State Supreme Court cleared the way today for the possible closing of all medical marijuana clubs in California as it left intact a lower court's ruling that the clubs could not sell the drug, despite a 1996 voter initiative. The court unanimously denied review of an appellate decision, issued last December, that said the ballot measure, Proposition 215, did not allow anyone to sell marijuana and did not allow a commercial enterprise to furnish marijuana as a ''primary care giver.''

VDorothy Dicent grew up surrounded by the cheerful commotion of five brothers and sisters in South Carolina. But she spent most of her childhood alone. Confused by voices that whispered in her head and a black hollow of melancholy inside her, she spent most of her time closeted away in her room, often battling suicidal urges. When she started cutting herself with a razor, her mother took her to a psychiatrist whose diagnosis was manic depression. She was 11 years old.

VA day after a ruling against medical marijuana clubs took effect statewide, a judge today granted a state request for an injunction against the Cannabis Cultivators Club here. The club said its operations would be unaffected. ''We are abiding by the law,'' said J. David Nick, a lawyer for Dennis Peron, founder of the club and author of Proposition 215, the medical marijuana initiative approved by voters in November 1996. Mr. Nick said the club's continued distribution of marijuana to patients complied with a state appeals court ruling and the injunction issued today.

VThe Clinton Administration does no favor to Mexico or its own credibility by certifying that Mexico is ''fully cooperating'' in the fight against drug trafficking. Compounding the damage, the White House Drug Policy Director, Barry McCaffrey, fatuously claims that Mexican cooperation is ''absolutely superlative.'' A more truthful assessment can be found in the Drug Enforcement Administration's confidential evaluation, described by Tim Golden in yesterday's Times. The D.E.A. concludes that ''the Government of Mexico has not accomplished its counter-narcotics goals or succeeded in cooperation with the United States Government.'' Mexican trafficking has increased, the D.E.A. notes, and the corruption of its enforcement agencies ''continues unabated.''

VThe advertised price was $30 for an eighth of an ounce of ''Five Star Mexican Gold,'' and dollar bills were exchanged at a brisk clip today for plastic bags of marijuana. But, in deference to a new court ruling barring the sale of the drug by clubs, a hastily erected sign over the marijuana bar read: ''Remuneration Station.'' ''We are not selling marijuana anymore,'' Dennis Peron, founder of the Cannabis Cultivators Club, said today, explaining his latest strategy to keep open what looks like America's closest copy of an Amsterdam hashish bar. ''We are selling fertilizer, nutrients, lighting, pruning, the labor for production.''

VTHE driver was late, the aide had the directions all wrong, and as Colombia's Ambassador rode up Capitol Hill the other day to defend his country's drug-fighting record before one more skeptical audience, his only armor was two copies of a thin, boring-looking Government report. For the emissary of a country whose drug-enforcement efforts had failed the United States' certification test two years in a row, the Ambassador, Juan Carlos Esguerra, was looking remarkably unperturbed. ''When we didn't know what it would mean to be decertified, we were terribly worried that it would have catastrophic effects,'' Mr. Esguerra said, recalling the all-out lobbying campaigns that Colombia waged in past years in vain attempts to avoid the Clinton Administration's censure. ''Once you know the impact, you know you can handle it.''

VAS of early January, Mike Nick was an unknown, just a stocky 21-year-old who could do crazy tricks like aerial spins and flips on short, fat planks that resemble miniature snowboards. Then he won the first-ever skiboarding contest at the winter X Games in Crested Butte, Colo., and he was mobbed by reporters. A dozen ringed him slopeside, and the announcer for ESPN -- which produces the X Games and broadcasts the alternative-sports Olympics on its two cable television channels -- informed a million-plus viewers that Nick, a junior at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, was now ''the sensation of rotation.'' You could almost hear the cash registers going ka-ching. Skiboarding, a sport that didn't even exist until 1995, had suddenly become legitimate. Frontside Films, in Santa Monica, Calif., has secured financing to produce ''Skiboarding: The Movie.'' A six-stop professional skiboarding tour has been organized for next year, and Nick's sponsor, Line Skiboards of Albany, N.Y., instantly doubled its production staff.

Milan Lejhanec of Ridgewood, Queens, and another individual whose identity was withheld by Federal prosecutors because he was at large, were charged with eight counts, including alien smuggling, visa fraud, and transporting and inducing women into prostitution. If convicted on all charges, they could face up to 50 years in prison.

VEVEN if the only noteworthy thing Marian McPartland had done in her long life was play jazz piano outstandingly well, she would still be deserving of the all-star concert being given in honor of her birthday on Saturday at Town Hall. But Ms. McPartland, who was born in Windsor, England, 80 years ago Friday, is far more than just a pianist. She is also a strikingly individual composer, an excellent writer, the host of one of the longest-running jazz programs in the history of network radio and, as if all that weren't enough for one lifetime, the widow of Jimmy McPartland, the tough-talking cornet player from Chicago who replaced Bix Beiderbecke in the Wolverines when his wife-to-be was only 6 years old. Confronted with a list of her achievements, Ms. McPartland, a small, delicate-looking woman with sharp eyes and a strong chin, is apt to make bashful noises and change the subject. ''She's never had an ego problem,'' says Bill Crow, who played bass in her trio 40 years ago and will be rejoining her at Town Hall, together with the drummer Joe Morello, another McPartland alumnus who, like so many of her former sidemen, went on to have a stellar career in his own right (Mr. Morello's next stop was the Dave Brubeck Quartet). ''She's always had a wonderful ear and harmonic imagination, and it's gotten better and better. But you wouldn't know it from talking to her.''

VDr. Benjamin Spock, the pediatrician who gently coached anxious postwar parents to trust their ''own common sense,'' only to be blamed by some critics for the self-indulgence of those parents' children, the 60's generation, died on Sunday at his home in San Diego. He was 94. Over half a century, Dr. Spock's homey handbook on child care, now titled ''Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care,'' became one of the best sellers of all time. Therese Zazycki, a spokeswoman for Pocket Books, its main publisher, said yesterday that almost 50 million copies have been sold around the world, translated into 42 languages.

VOn a recent blustery afternoon at Bayonne Park, Kevin DiGiorgio pushed his father's car across the parking lot, sprinted down a field while pulling a sled carrying 300 pounds and raced up a hill with 140 pounds of extra weight on his torso. These unorthodox, muscle-searing training methods have enabled DiGiorgio, a 17-year-old senior at Bayonne High School, to develop into the nation's leading high school shot-putter. DiGiorgio has won 25 consecutive shot-put competitions over two years, thrown the 12-pound ball more than a foot farther than his nearest opponent, set several state records and on Sunday won his third straight title in the National Scholastic Indoor Track and Field Championships in Boston.

VIt has been 20 years since Jake Burton began turning out snowboards from his small shop in Londonderry, Vt. He is the largest snowboard manufacturer in the world now, but a lot of good that did him at the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. ''I couldn't get into the riders' room to talk to the athletes,'' the 43-year-old Burton said recently about not having the proper Olympic credentials. ''But that was part of how the ski federation does it. We're just not accustomed to that level of bureaucracy.''

VThe political battles and attendant bitterness over government financing of the arts is enough to make one long for the days of enlightened private patronage. The current budget of the National Endowment for the Arts, $98 million, is the smallest in 20 years, and even that sum barely survived a divided Congress. There are private foundations, of course, but they can be as cumbersome and politically driven as government arts panels. Corporate giving usually comes with strings attached and seldom goes to cutting-edge work.

VIt was a trip of four and a half miles, to haul a trailer of Mexican-made air-conditioner parts from a warehouse in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, to a freight forwarder just across the border in Texas. For Salvador Romero, the driver, the journey took 29 hours, door to door. First came a four-hour backup on the Mexican side. Then, once Mr. Romero made it across the Lincoln-Juarez Bridge over the Rio Grande, his truck got flagged for a random, intensive search by United States Customs agents and their drug-sniffing dogs. A paperwork mistake meant the trailer had to stay parked at Customs overnight. More inspection backups meant the search was not finished until the next afternoon.

VShortly after 9 o'clock on the morning of Dec. 3, 1997, the 14 members of the Governor's Task Force on Driving While Intoxicated and Vehicular Homicide took their seats in a hearing room in the Louisiana State Capitol Building in Baton Rouge. The issue before them: whether the state should add a provision to Louisiana's drinking law that would prohibit 18- to 20-year-olds from entering bars. The law currently allows them into bars, even while it prohibits them from buying or drinking alcohol. The law is widely flouted, however, and most of the task-force members -- highway officials, state legislators, local sheriffs, a representative from Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) -- were united on the need to change what they saw as a loophole. The loophole, they believed, was encouraging college students to spend their nights carousing rather than studying. They also felt it was contributing to the carnage on the state's highways. In 1995, Louisiana had 883 traffic fatalities, of which slightly more than half were alcohol-related -- the third highest rate in the country. In seeking to close the loophole, however, the task force faced a formidable obstacle: Charles Tapp, one of its members. A lobbyist for the state alcohol industry, the silver-haired, tart-tongued Tapp was on the attack from the moment the first witness was seated. ''You're the executive director of what organization?'' he snarled at Sharron Ayers, who represented the Louisiana Alliance to Prevent Under-Age Drinking, a coalition of grass-roots groups, state agencies and private organizations. Closing the loophole, she said, would make it harder for young people to drink.

VA coalition of agricultural, commercial and environmental groups is pushing the Clinton Administration to overturn the prohibition on cultivation of all Cannabis strains so those that lack the intoxicating properties of marijuana can again be grown. Hemp has developed a reputation for being an earth-friendly crop with extensive uses in fiber products that draws high praise from some manufacturers. But officials at the White House drug office quickly dismissed that notion, branding it a subterfuge for legalization and they noted that the idea of allowing hemp farms had already been studied and rejected.

VTHERE are two commonly held beliefs about today's New York. No. 1: Things are good. No. 2: Everyone agrees about No. 1. The prevailing wisdom holds that the city is basking in a glorious period of renewal, evidenced and enhanced by a robust economy, a revitalized cultural scene and surging self-confidence.

VNew York's Riding High. But How Much Is Hot Air?
p72070
ssVabstract
p72071
VUpbeat news that New York City is basking in a glorious period of economic and social renewal is seen by some resident skeptics as largely a creation of high-powered civic boosters who have a major stake in how the city is percieved; and, the critics say, the city's refurbished image has little to do with the lives of most New Yorkers; sampling of comments suggesting a reality check is due; drawings; photo (L)

VCAN March be almost over? Didn't they play the Super Bowl just last week? It sometimes seems that with each passing year, the days and weeks zip by more quickly. If you have ever had this feeling, you are not imagining it. Studies of human time perception show that age-related changes in the nervous system alter one's sense of time; it really does seem to move more quickly with age. At a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in New Orleans in November, a psychologist, Dr. Peter A. Mangan, reported on a study in which he asked people in different age groups to estimate when three minutes had passed by silently counting one-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand and so on. People in their early 20's were accurate within three seconds, and some got it exactly right. People in their 60's estimated that three minutes were up after 3 minutes and 40 seconds had passed. Middle-aged subjects fell in between but, like the older people, all underestimated the passage of time.

VA witness in the Tawana Brawley defamation trial who had testified that he thought Ms. Brawley fabricated her story endured a withering cross-examination today after jurors were shown a televised interview in which he characterized the Rev. Al Sharpton with an expletive. Mr. Sharpton's lawyer, Michael A. Hardy, threw the expletive back at the witness, Officer Tommy Young of the Poughkeepsie Police Department, over and over again as he sought to discredit him.

VA team of Federal marshals seized control of a 26-unit rooming house yesterday, saying that the building had served as a drug supermarket for the last three years. During the early-morning raid, Federal agents arrested the building's landlord, David A. Ginsberg, and charged him with taking money from drug dealers in exchange for allowing them to sell crack cocaine, heroin and marijuana from the building, prosecutors said.

VFor years, government agents have used dogs to detect drugs in ships, planes and cargo at points of entry like airports and seaports. Now, drug-sniffing dogs are working at points of entry between New Jersey and New York City. Five German shepherds, with olfactory senses that would give nightmares to the Cali cartel, were put on the beat of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey a week ago. Their patchwork jurisdiction includes three airports, major seaports, four bridges and two Hudson River tunnels.

VIt wasn't quite the Maltese Falcon, but there was a treasure of gems: 33 colored diamonds, the largest a marquise-cut, intense blue stone weighing more than three carats. There was no Humphrey Bogart, but there were Federal agents and a manhunt. There was no Peter Lorre or Sydney Greenstreet. But there was Stephen Jenks of Largo (no Key), Fla. The jewels were confiscated by the United States Customs Service from Mr. Jenks, who was arrested in 1994 and pleaded guilty the next year to running a multimillion-dollar marijuana smuggling ring. They are to be auctioned at Christie's on April 6 and 7, the first time that Customs, and perhaps any Federal agency, has teamed up with a leading auction house to sell seized property, although the Government has used smaller auctioneers for years. Christie's estimates the total sale price at $400,000 to $500,000.

VTwo brothers from Staten Island have been indicted on charges of stealing $3,600 from a bank in New Jersey and trying to steal from two other banks in 1994 and 1995, Federal prosecutors announced on Friday. The brothers, Thomas Capace, 30, and Christopher Capace, 23, were accused in a Federal indictment of stealing the money from the Amboy National Bank in Old Bridge by ripping the night deposit box from the wall of the bank with a chain attached to the fender of a stolen car, said Aidan P. O'Connor, an assistant United States attorney. The brothers tried the same technique at two other banks, in Marlboro and East Brunswick, but were unable to get any money, Mr. O'Connor said.

VThe Supreme Court decided the issue a decade ago: union members have the right to claim refunds of portions of their dues not spent on collective bargaining. If your union leader wants to contribute to a bill legalizing marijuana, and you're against pot smoking, you can get back from the union that part of your dues that went to support what you oppose. That strikes most Americans as eminently fair. But try to assert your right in the real world; the shop steward will make you a pariah, and the Clinton Administration, dependent on money from unions, will refuse to enforce your constitutional right.

VWhether he was starring in a critically panned movie or holed up in a recording studio when he should have been working on his free-throw form, Shaquille O'Neal has been taken to task for caring more about his image than basketball. ''That's what people say, but I really don't care what people think,'' O'Neal said before he carved up the Nets for 50 points on Thursday night at the Meadowlands. ''I'm not worried about my image. I answer to only God, Jerry West, my parents, my coaching staff and my teammates. That's it.''

VNow that the big boys, the Mets and the Yankees, are back, we can afford to sweat the small stuff, the melting Rangers and the nicked Knicks and the shark attack on college sports. Baseball is still the national pastime; what other sport can offer us world-class, blockbuster, fascinating villains like Huizenga and Murdoch? Poor hockey. The only owner we ever got to care about was the pink-cheeked John Spano, who conned the National Hockey League into thinking he had the money to buy the Islanders last year. This year, still sheepish, the ''coolest game on earth'' tried to recoup, to seem more like its younger, richer brother, the National Basketball Association, by sending its pros to the Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. Not only were the men overshadowed by the style and spirit of the amateur women's team, they also managed to embarrass themselves on their own.

VIn the burned-out heart of a 200-year-old factory district here, a developer wants to pay the city for the right to build 64 town houses where for a generation there has been little but rubble and failure. Under the three-year-old proposal, the Regan Development Corporation of Yonkers, which has already carried out historical renovations in Paterson, would pay the city about $320,000 for the seven-and-one-half-acre site, whose last working factory burned in 1983 and whose only occupants are squatters. On March 24, the City Council voted 6 to 2 to approve the land sale.

VTWO years ago Social Security privatization probably had no more support in Washington than the legalization of marijuana. Today, the notion is being entertained by such heavyweights as Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. Privatization has become a very real possibility in part because big budget surpluses are apparently available to help pay for the transition. ''Something labeled 'partial privatization' is bound to be included in any broad-based Social Security reform,'' predicted Sylvester Schieber, an economist at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a pension consulting company, and a member of the Government's Advisory Council on the system.

VTen years ago, at the height of New York City's crack epidemic, a notorious drug gang called the Supreme Team brought in $250,000 a week selling crack in and around a southeast Queens housing project known as the Baisley Park Houses, ruthlessly mowing down those in their way. Now, years after the gang's leaders were sent to prison for murder and racketeering and the gang was effectively quashed, the police have arrested 15 men and 9 women who the authorities say called themselves the New Supreme Team, selling marijuana, crack and cocaine in and around the same housing project. They were arrested in a raid late Wednesday night by the police and officials with the Queens District Attorney's office.

VThe Ice Storm It is Thanksgiving 1973 in Ang Lee's film and life teeters on the brink in New Canaan, Conn. Watergate and marijuana smoke are in the air; car keys are for the picking at spouse-swapping parties, and the Hoods (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen) and the Carvers (Jamey Sheridan and Sigourney Weaver, above) struggle with a deadening malaise that strands them and their children on shifting ground. Despite a fatal accident, it is the distance between the characters and between them and viewers that remains ''an essential part of the film's disturbing power,'' wrote Janet Maslin in The New York Times. 1997. Fox. $104.16. Laser disk, $39.99. 113 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Tuesday.

VTraditional jurisprudence frowns on guilt by association -- unless the defendant is a plant called industrial hemp and the prosecutor is the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Recently a coalition of farmers, environmentalists and businesses petitioned the drug agency and the Department of Agriculture to stop treating this plant as a criminal just because it is related to marijuana, a controlled substance. Otherwise, America's farmers and entrepreneurs will be at a disadvantage as other industrial democracies try to exploit hemp's commercial potential and environmental benefits. The revival of interest in industrial hemp, which has 1 percent or less of the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, called THC, that gives marijuana its psychoactive effect, flows from the versatility of its seed and fiber. The seed can be converted into food oil, animal feed, paints and cosmetics. The fiber can be turned into textile, rope, carpets, paper products and construction materials. In at least 10 states, farmers also want to assess its value as a rotation crop that is pest- and disease-resistant. Ford researchers abroad are studying it as a lightweight material for radiator grilles and other auto parts.

The owner spent $200 million for a modern arena, choosing not to build it in the suburbs, but rather downtown so that a broader commercial life might return. He then spent $105 million to hang onto the team's emerging star. And all along, the Wizards, playing in an overwhelmingly black city, took pride in having a black general manager and a black coach -- the only current team in the National Basketball Association to have both.

VTo the Editor: A. M. Rosenthal's notion (column, April 14) of ''backdoor legalization'' of drugs is odd. How could such a major change occur unnoticed? Ending prohibition would require votes taken in the halls of power or the ballot box -- the front door. Perhaps medical marijuana will spark a rethinking of drug policy. But open debate is the lifeblood of democracy, and should be welcomed, not feared or denounced. DAVID BORDEN Executive Director Drug Reform Coordination Network Washington, April 14, 1998

VIt should not come as a surprise that the Minnesota Vikings made the controversial selection of Marshall wide receiver Randy Moss with the 21st pick in the National Football League draft. The team had been preparing to draft him for days. Moss's stock fell because of a number of off-the-field issues. Moss, a 6-foot-5-inch receiver with 4.3 speed, pleaded guilty to battery while in high school, tested positive for marijuana while in college and was arrested on domestic battery charges in 1996. These problems led teams such as the St. Louis Rams, the New Orleans Saints and the Giants to remove him from their draft board.

VGeorgia gubernatorial candidate Michael J Bowers and his wife, Betty Rose, recently met with press as he tried to salvage his campaign after disclosures about his 15-year affair with former aide, Anne Davis; it is testament to environment in which voters appear less judgmental and more forgiving of private lapses of their public servants that Bowers's campaign has survived, though he has lost his standing as favorite in Republican primary on July 21; allegations about Pres Clinton's private life seem to have toughened--and often exasperated--electorate that now has more realistic expectations and is not as quick to put politicians on pedestal or expect them to be happily married; politicians and spouses, instead of retreating to shadows, are boldly fighting back--telling voters that job performance, not personal conduct, is all that is relevant; photo (M)

VTo the Editor: The news from the drug front discussed by A. M. Rosenthal (column, April 14) presents a mixed picture. Scientific data about the short- and long-term effects on the brain of drugs like cocaine and marijuana are increasing, as is our ability to treat addicts. We continue to learn more about the commonality of the way these drugs act and how they hijack the brain, eroding, but not erasing, the ability to control their use.

VMORISHIMA-Akira, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Pediatrics. The Department of Pediatrics of the College of Physicians & Surgeons at Columbia University and the Pediatric Service and Alumni Association of Babies & Children's Hospital of New York, ColumbiaPresbyterian Medical Center, mourn the loss of their esteemed friend and colleague. A former Director of the Division of Pediatric Endocrinology (1968-1995), Dr. Morishima was an early leader in the field of genetics and did innovative work with his mentor, Melvin Grumbach, MD, in describing normal characteristics as well as disorders of the X chromosome. He also was involved in collaborative studies on the mutagenic properties of marijuana and other recreational drugs. Most recently, and most importantly, Dr. Morishima, through his insights from work with patients, elucidated in a very exciting way the role estrogen plays in bone growth and bone calcification and in normal pituitary-gonadal interactions in both sexes. Dr. Morishima maintained professional ties with Japan as a visiting professor and keynote speaker at professional meetings and was active in the Japanese-American communities in New York and New Jersey. In recognition of these activities, in 1975 he received the prestigious ''Presentation of a Favour'' from the Emperor and Empress of Japan. Dr. Morishima was an enthusiastic teacher and generous colleague. We are grateful for the guidance and insights he gave us during his long years of leadership in the Department and in the field of pediatric endocrinology. John M. Driscoll, Jr., MD Reibem S. Carpentier Professor Director, Pediatric Service Chairman, Dept of Pediatrics MORISHIMA-Dr. Akira. With fondness I will remember your clinical, academic and ethical standards, your quiet hospitality and your friendship. Rest peacefully Maribeth Southworth

VAfter a brief court-ordered closing, this city's most famous medical marijuana club reopened today under a new name and director, once again thwarting efforts by the California Attorney General to shut it down. The closing resulted from a ruling in San Francisco County Superior Court on April 15 that the Cannabis Cultivators Club, which opened in 1992 and has a membership of 8,000, was ''clearly engaging in the illegal sale of marijuana.'' The court also ordered the club's founder, Dennis R. Peron, to quit selling marijuana.

VIn the search to explain the spike in smoking among black teen-agers, a range of theories has evolved, from the proliferation of tobacco advertising in minority communities to the stress of adolescence to the identification with entertainment idols who appear with cigarettes dangling from their lips. Teen-agers themselves, and some experts who have studied adolescent smoking, add another, less predictable explanation to the mix of factors: the decision to take up smoking because of a belief that cigarettes prolong the heady rush of marijuana.

VTRAY was The Man,'' Junior Felix decreed as he mopped the dark stairway of a beat-up apartment building on East 159th Street in the Bronx. ''He showed mad love. He never used to flip. He just The Man.'' Actually, The Man was a dog. Tray was a pit bull, to be exact, which means that not everyone on the block in Melrose shared Junior's warm thoughts. On Jan. 6, fire marshals shot the dog after he chased one of them onto the roof of a car in a parking lot they use on the block, and he died several days later. Fire investigators deemed it a justifiable shooting, saying that the dog had menaced other marshals before and that no one was around that day to call him off.

VThere was a strange contradiction at the Terrastock festival, a three-day marathon of underground psychedelic folk, pop, rock and experimental music that ended on Sunday at the Custer Avenue Stages here: the music celebrated drugs for an audience that didn't. Mick Farren of the 1960's proto-punk band the Deviants began his set with a story about a time he had taken ''a whole lotta acid.'' Tom Rapp of the 60's acid-folk group Pearls Before Swine sang a new chorus he had written, ''Nothing wrong with marijuana/You should use it if you wanna.'' And Nick Saloman of the English rock band Bevis Frond, who publishes the magazine that sponsored the two-year-old festival, Ptolemaic Terrascope, introduced a song thus: ''This one continues the theme of drug-taking, and involves driving trains.''

Clients, the investigators said, would call saying ''we're hungry,'' and cocaine or marijuana would arrive soon thereafter to satisfy their appetites.

VThe subject tomorrow night is marijuana: how easy to grow, how profitable to sell, how severe the punishment if you are caught growing or selling or even just using. The producers of ''Busted: America's War on Marijuana'' take no position on the debate over the laws that have filled prisons with people who have committed a nonviolent crime, but they do clear the air a little. This ''Frontline'' report begins in Indiana, in the heart of what is labeled ''the marijuana basket of America,'' with the arrest of a suspected grower. Half of the marijuana used in the United States is domestically grown, and it serves quite a market; the program puts it between 10 million and 30 million Americans, more than those who use all other illegal drugs combined. With an ounce of marijuana going for more than an ounce of gold (now above $300) these days, it's quite a commodity.

According to the Paterson police, Franklin Pettiford Jr., 46, swallowed the bag while locked inside a car, refusing to surrender to narcotics officers who had seen him buying drugs. The prosecutor, Ronald S. Fava, said a preliminary investigation had confirmed the police account.

VPresident Clinton said today that he would nominate a career diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Davidow, as Ambassador to Mexico, a post vacant for almost 10 months because of wrangling between the White House and the Senate. The President's first choice, William F. Weld, the former Governor of Massachusetts, withdrew his name last year after it became clear that the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, would never allow the nomination to come to a Senate vote.

VTRYING to label America's nearly 60 million teen-agers is about as easy as staying on the trail of a snowboarder in a whiteout. No definition can stretch far enough to include bubbly Hanson fans and moody Marilyn Manson devotees, marijuana-smoking homeboys and savvy junior entrepreneurs, born-again virgins and single moms, student activists and frustrated truants -- especially when one teen-ager might inhabit several of those identities. As adults circle, fascinated, teen-agers survive and thrive within these interlocking universes. If these teen-agers must be tagged, call them the Autonomous Generation, creating themselves in nobody's image but their own. Nicole Hernandez is one such 1990's teen-ager. She lives in Elmhurst, Queens, but not with her parents. Fleeing a troubled home, she became an emancipated minor last year and moved in with her boyfriend and his mother. Nicole likes going to clubs and concerts, but spends most of her time juggling high-school classes, chores and a full-time restaurant job.

VTHE LIFE OF INSECTS By Viktor Pelevin Translated by Andrew Bromfield. 179 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $22. Viktor Pelevin has slowly been gaining a reputation as a post-Soviet satirist of Soviet life, a writer of absurdist extremes. His book ''Omon Ra'' was a parody of the glory of the Soviet space program. It centered on the idea that the Soviet Union had, contrary to appearances, not developed the ability to send cosmonauts into space and bring them back, which explains why the men recruited into the program were such heroes.

These aggressive paramilitary tactics were denounced as intolerable and ''fascist'' by Democratic and Republican senators as the panel heard testimony for a second day in its second round of hearings on I.R.S. abuses of taxpayers.

VIn the back of every parent's mind, crowded in with worries about the job, the bills, the waistline and grandma, is a certain fear about the children -- that we haven't prepared them well enough, that their world won't be good enough, that we can't do anything about it. No wonder so many parents are glum. Fortunately, someone decided to ask the children how they are. A New York Times/CBS News Poll of about 1,000 children age 13 to 17 divulged its results this week. Some of the news, of course, is dismaying. Almost 60 percent of the teen-agers said they had cheated on some exam. Half said they knew someone who had attempted suicide. Almost 20 percent knew someone who had the AIDS virus or had died of it. More thought that drugs were a big problem in their schools than in 1994. Fewer were happy with the way they looked than kids were four years ago. But most of them won't be reading about it in this editorial, because about three-quarters don't read a newspaper most days of the week.

VIT seems like a movie now, that day in March when mankind was forced to drop its puny temporal concerns for a moment and contemplate the unthinkable: a reliable report that the end might be nigh. And like a movie, this brush with destiny had a happy ending. Within 24 hours of hearing the dark news that an approaching asteroid as wide as the Mississippi had an outside chance of hitting Earth in 2028, the world got word that the initial projections on the big rock's path had been off by, oh, 500,000 miles. In short, never mind. But the scare was real while it lasted, and if it wasn't quite the day the Earth stood still, it was a moment imaginations ran wild. Suddenly people were discussing, in earnest, extinction. They were fearing for the children, asking searching existential questions, falling back lamely on gallows humor about cashing out their I.R.A.'s. The refrain of the day came with a slow shake of the head: ''Can you imagine?''

VON Sunday, April 5, the artist Ralph Steadman and the director Terry Gilliam, who are friends, met at Mr. Steadman's house in the English countryside to talk about Mr. Gilliam's new movie, ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,'' which opens on May 22. Based on the landmark 1971 document of American cultural disequilibrium that was written by Hunter S. Thompson and illustrated by Mr. Steadman, the film stars Johnny Depp as Mr. Thompson's alter ego, Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro as his partner-in-lunacy, Dr. Gonzo, who go on a drug- and alchohol-fueled jaunt into the desert in a crimson convertible. To capture the 2 1/2-hour conversation, which careered from topic to topic -- the movie, the book, art, film, old times, drugs and the idiosyncrasies of Mr. Thompson -- Mr. Steadman set up four tape recorders and a video recorder. ''Appropriately, it is a work about paranoia,'' Mr. Steadman explained. Here are excerpts.

VBruce Seldon, a former World Boxing Association heavyweight champion, pleaded guilty yesterday to two counts of child endangerment, admitting he engaged in sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl after taking sexually provocative photographs of her, prosecutors in New Jersey said. During his plea in Superior Court in Camden, Seldon, 31, told Judge Stephen W. Thompson that he met the girl on a street in Atlantic City last November and took her back to his home in Gloucester Township, N.J., where they smoked marijuana.

Buju Banton started out as a dance hall toaster, boasting about girls, guns and macho exploits including an infamous song about gay-bashing. Then he changed his mind and his music, turning to songs about spirituality and an end to violence on one of the most important reggae albums of the 1990's, ''Til Shiloh.'' Beres Hammond has been singing love songs and message songs since the 1970's, but has come into his own in the 1990's. Tonight at 8; tickets, $35 to $45 (Jon Pareles).

VON the back lot of Universal Studios, hip-hop's rising star Canibus is lounging in a trailer parked in front of the clock-tower building best known from the set of the ''Back to the Future'' movies. On break from filming a video for ''How Come,'' a single he raps on from the Warren Beatty movie ''Bulworth,'' Canibus is waiting for a meeting with an executive at Dreamworks Records who wants to sign him to a publishing deal. In his back pocket is a cassette of a song that the teen-age singer and sitcom star Brandy wants him to rap on, and in his hands is a bottle of Hype, a natural energy beverage that he says he drinks to immunize himself from the hype constantly bombarding him. The drink, he says, keeps him from getting ''hype-notized'' and succumbing to ''hype-nitis,'' which occurs when you believe your own hype. It is a disease common among pop stars. ''I have cases and cases of Hype,'' Canibus said, a smirk spreading across his smooth, strong face. ''You will never catch me without one.''
