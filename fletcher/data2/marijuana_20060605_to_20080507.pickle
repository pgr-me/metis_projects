VIT'S prom season and graduation is just around the corner. If there ever was a time to focus on the problem of underage drinking here in Connecticut, it's now, when teenagers are busy celebrating their final days of high school and the beginning of independence, in many cases by popping a cork or opening a bottle. Why should we focus on underage drinking? Because we have a serious problem in this state. Every year, hundreds of teenagers in Connecticut are injured in alcohol-related accidents and assaults. And what's worse is that these teenagers (and about 138,000 of their drinking peers who avoid violent injuries) are also being harmed in a less visible way by significant and documented harm to their developing brains. For a state with our per capita wealth, population talents and diverse resources, we -- parents and elected officials -- are letting our children down.

VAlmost a year after Elizabeth Butler, a vivacious high school senior from North Salem, was found strangled and stabbed to death in her parents' car, her former boyfriend was found guilty of the murder. The former boyfriend, Ariel Menendez, 28, of the Bronx, whom the police described as unwilling to accept the breakup of the couple's relationship, was convicted Tuesday of two counts of first-degree murder, and first-degree rape and a criminal sexual act. It took the jury two hours to reach a verdict.

VSo who are these "food police" we're starting to hear so much about? The term has begun showing up in media accounts of campaigns to reform school lunch or in discussions of the food industry's growing legion of critics in the media. It's the "food police" who want to get soda out of the schools and who argue that fast food outlets should disclose nutritional information about what they sell. The "food police" supposedly want to take away your constitutional right to a Big Mac - or, at the very least, your right to enjoy a Big Mac with a clear conscience.

VThe police in Hanover searched the Dartmouth College fraternity house that inspired the 1978 movie ''National Lampoon's Animal House'' for more than five hours on Thursday. The search was part of a nearly two-year investigation, they said. A member of the fraternity, Alpha Delta, was arrested on drug charges and released. The police said that the student, 19, was charged with marijuana possession and that a second student was expected to face a similar charge. Police Chief Nicholas J. Giaccone Jr. would not reveal the nature of the investigation, and a judge has placed the search warrant and affidavits under seal. The police removed 10 crates, 2 bags, a videotape and a computer, the Associated Press reported. ''The primary object of the search was not drugs,'' Chief Giaccone said, but would not comment further. KATIE ZEZIMA (NYT)

VA STAGE for one of New York's longest-running and most eclectic shows: that's what Washington Square Park provides, for a constantly shifting audience of old men with ponytails, teenage girls with jagged bangs, children kicking soccer balls, and suited workers just kicking back, among others. On any afternoon, the park's matchbox-shaped patch of green can easily feature bluegrass banjo-pickers, wisecracking jugglers and accordion-squeezers, all in a freewheeling circus. Even the speed-chess fanatics at the southwestern corner can seem part of the act.

VThe city's special prosecutor for narcotics criticized the revisions in the Rockefeller drug laws yesterday, saying they benefited major drug traffickers more than the low-level offenders they were supposed to help. A year and a half after the State Legislature revised the drug laws in an effort to reduce harsh prison sentences for low-level offenders, a study by the prosecutor, Bridget G. Brennan, examined 84 drug offenders prosecuted by her office who have asked for resentencing since the laws were changed in 2004. The offenders had been convicted of possessing or selling enough hard drugs to make them eligible for sentences of at least 15 years to life.

VNew York City Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget G Brennan conducts study of prisoners granted resentencing under New York State Rockefeller drug laws; finds that 34 percent of prisoners who received shorter sentences were drug kingpins or major traffickers and not low-level offenders new laws were aimed at helping; some say her study is flawed because it only looked at cases handled by her office, which has disproportionate number of high-level drug cases (M)

VINTERNATIONAL A3-9 Israel Hits Fatah Offices As Strikes Increase in Gaza Israeli aircraft intensified their attacks on Palestinian targets in Gaza, hitting the downtown offices of the Fatah political party and sites in the northern part of the territory after Israel's prime minister ordered his military to do whatever necessary to pressure militants to free a captured Israeli soldier. A1 Plan Guided Bali Bombings Indonesian police have uncovered a document from the computer of a planner of an attack last October in Bali that killed 20 people. Experts say it offers a glimpse into the minds of terrorist plotters and of the kind of meticulous planning involved in even a relatively simple operation. A1 Mexico Votes in Tight Race Millions of Mexicans voted to decide the tightest race for president in their history, but as the last polling stations closed there was still no clear winner between a leftist firebrand who has promised to lift the poor and a conservative technocrat backed by business leaders. A8 Iraqi Sunnis Boycott Parliament The main Sunni Arab political bloc in Iraq began a boycott of Parliament to protest the kidnapping of a Sunni legislator and threatened to withdraw its members from the prime minister's cabinet unless she was freed within the next 48 hours. A9 Iran Rejects Deadline on Offer Iran again rejected a deadline to respond to an international proposal to end the standoff over its nuclear program, saying it will respond in a month. A4 Afghans Wary of U.S. Tactics A joint military raid by American and Afghan forces on a house in Kabul, Afghanistan, on March 20 has pointed up the tensions between the American military and the Afghan Defense Ministry over the conduct of counterinsurgency raids. A9 Ex-Leader of Chad Faces Trial A court in Senegal must try Hissène Habré, the former dictator of Chad, for human rights violations he is accused of committing during his eight-year rule, an African Union panel said. Senegal's president, Abdoulaye Wade, said he would comply with the request. A4 World Cup Disappoints Brothels The World Cup has not generated a surge in demand for prostitution or an influx of temporary prostitutes from Eastern Europe as many in Germany's legal sex industry had predicted. A3 OBITUARIES B7 Fernando Sanchez A fashion designer who captured the naughty side of 1970's fashion with lingerie collections conceived for elegant boudoirs but often worn in public, he was 70. B7 Vern Leroy Bullough A historian of medicine and sexuality noted for chronicling the development of American nursing, he was 77. B7 NATIONAL A10-13 Old Rivals Find Benefits In Political Partnership After years of competitive and often contentious dealings, President Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona are building a deepening if impersonal relationship that is serving the political needs of both men and could prove valuable to Mr. McCain in his efforts to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. A1 Cannabis Club Moving to Wharf The Green Cross is a cannabis club, one of about 30 in San Francisco that sell marijuana to patients with a doctor's note. But none of San Francisco's medical marijuana dispensaries have been in places anywhere as popular as Fisherman's Wharf. With the opening of the new club just weeks away, some are fighting to keep it out. A1 Senator Calls for Digital Budget Exasperated by his party's failure to cut government spending, Senator Tom Coburn, left, Republican of Oklahoma, wants to create a public database, searchable over the Internet, that would list most government contracts and grants, exposing hundreds of billions in annual spending to instant desktop view. A10 Licensing Laws Save Lives Laws that restrict 16-year-old drivers from carrying passengers and from driving at night help cut fatal accidents substantially, a new study said. It found that in states with such programs, the rate of 16-year-olds involved in fatal accidents is 20 percent lower than in states without them. A10 Congress Reacts to Court Case Democratic leaders, in response to the Supreme Court's rebuke of the Bush administration last week, called for a closer consultation with Congress and a broad review of the administration's use of executive power to combat terrorism. Republican leaders called for a more limited response. A11 Shuttle Launching Delayed NASA scrubbed the launching of the shuttle Discovery for the second day in a row as thunderstorms and clouds cloaked the Kennedy Space Center. If the launching is not completed by July 19, it will have to be postponed until late August. A11 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Bosses Move Back to City After Long Period of Flight The number of Fortune 500 companies based in New York City has been inching upward, reversing a long, steep decline. But the new arrivals do not resemble headquarters of the past, packed with middle managers and supporting personnel, they are mostly bosses who can network with their peers, while keeping the rank-and-file in less expensive quarters in suburbs or other cities. A1 Mob Trial Details Decline As prosecutors and mafia turncoats in Federal District Court in Brooklyn told stories of gangland murder that could land Baldassore Amato in prison for life, they also told another story about the decline of the Bonanno family. B1 Kerik's Name Taken Off Jail The Bernard B. Kerik Complex, an 881-bed jail dedicated by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 2001 in honor of the former police commissioner, was renamed and will again be called the Manhattan Detention Complex. The decision was made a day after Mr. Kerik pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court in the Bronx to two misdemeanors. B1 ARTS E1-12 Signs of Box Office Resurgence After abandoning theaters in worrying numbers last summer, American moviegoers are returning to the multiplex, steadily if slowly. Through the first 25 weeks of the year, domestic box-office revenue was up nearly 5 percent, to $4.6 billion, according to the tracking company Exhibitor Relations. E1 Web Site Saves Sitcom ''Nobody's Watching,'' a comedy pilot that was passed on by the WB network, has found a new life and a wide audience thanks to YouTube, where it had been downloaded more than 300,000 times by a growing legion of fans. E1 Beatles Tribute in Las Vegas The premiere of ''Love,'' the new Cirque du Soleil show set to the music of the Beatles, not only offered the closest thing possible to a Fab Four reunion, but it also prompted a gathering of Beatle families, friends and associates that may never be repeated. E3 BUSINESS DAY C1-8 Airbus Chief Steps Down The head of Airbus and the co-chief of its parent company resigned, following the disclosure of production delays for the Airbus A380 jumbo plane and an investigation into insider trading, which together have sent its shares tumbling. C1 Google Spends on Technology Google plans to spend more than $1.5 billion on plants and technology, with most of the hundreds of thousands of servers it will deploy custom-made to its own eccentric designs. C1 AT&T Gets Into TV AT&T plans to offer a new service, U-verse, that crams video, data and, in time, phone calls down one high-speed broadband line, allowing users to view multiple channels at once, get information about programs instantly and eventually access some Internet content via their televisions. C1 Business Digest C2 SPORTSMONDAY D1-8 All-Star Teams Named David Wright and and José Reyes were among six Mets players named to the National League All-Star team. The Yankees will have four players on the American League roster, including starters Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez.

VAn article yesterday about the anxiety Britons continue to feel over last year's terrorist bombing in London referred incompletely to the site of some of the reporting. While Karla Adam contributed information from Leeds, Alan Cowell, The Times correspondent, also did much of his reporting from there, then wrote the article in London.

VWhat if Tony Soprano were Irish, lived in Rhode Island and had a clean-cut brother in local politics? SHOWTIME is surely thinking forward to life after ''The Sopranos,'' and as a replacement proposes ''BROTHERHOOD,'' which has its premiere Sunday night at 10. JASON CLARKE stars as the Providence politician and family man, trying to avoid the rampant corruption around him. JASON ISAACS is his gangster brother, who has just come back to town after years on the run. There are suitcases full of money, suspicious construction sites and casual violence (including a severed ear in the first hour). The last few STEPHEN KING television projects haven't exactly been masterpieces. But the latest, ''NIGHTMARES & DREAMSCAPES: FROM THE STORIES OF STEPHEN KING,'' is at least highly ambitious. It's a four-week extravaganza of eight stories, beginning on Wednesday (TNT, 9 p.m.) with a commercial-free hour and a star turn by WILLIAM HURT. He plays a San Francisco hit man who kills a toy manufacturer, then finds himself under siege by an army of tiny plastic soldiers with surprisingly real weapons. That will be followed by CLAIRE FORLANI and EION BAILEY as newlyweds honeymooning in another dimension. The first season of the Showtime series ''WEEDS'' comes out on DVD on Tuesday (Lionsgate, $39.98). MARY-LOUISE PARKER, who beat out the ''Desperate Housewives'' stars for a Golden Globe, plays a tasteful suburban widow, soccer mom and marijuana dealer. Hey, how else is she going to keep her fabulous house? ELIZABETH PERKINS is her best friend (in a way), the most deliciously detestable role of her career. And now that Bruce Springsteen has gone folkie again, the latest ''AMERICAN MASTERS'' documentary, ''WOODY GUTHRIE: AIN'T GOT NO HOME'' (PBS, Wednesday, check local listings), seems timely. As the film puts it, Guthrie, who gave the world ''This Land Is Your Land,'' wasn't actually a hick, he just played one on radio.

VA judge on Monday struck down part of an Alaska law criminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana, saying it conflicted with past decisions by the Alaska Supreme Court. Under the ruling, people can possess less than an ounce of marijuana in their homes. The judge, Patricia A. Collins of Superior Court, granted a summary judgment to the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, which sued when the law took effect in June.

VA grandson of the borough president has been arrested for at least the third time this year, this time on charges that he beat up a paperboy, the authorities said yesterday. On Tuesday afternoon, the police said, a 14-year-old boy was delivering The Staten Island Advance in the Grasmere neighborhood when Steven Molinaro, 17, grandson of Borough President James P. Molinaro, approached the boy from behind, knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the head. The boy&#8217;s injuries included a cut lip. Steven Molinaro was charged with misdemeanor assault. He was arrested on marijuana charges earlier this year, the Staten Island district attorney&#8217;s office said. In February, he was charged with attempted murder in a group attack on a youth who was stabbed repeatedly. Those cases are pending.

VFOOTBALL TAGLIABUE VISITS SUPERDOME -- N.F.L. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue toured the hurricane-damaged Superdome yesterday with the New Orleans Saints' owner, Tom Benson, and Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana, and said he was encouraged with the progress that had been made. ''I think there are some terrific features in the renovation,'' he said, describing an overhaul of the Superdome's concession areas and luxury suites. ''There's a feeling of openness, freshness.'' Superdome officials say they hope to find a corporation to buy naming rights before the Saints are scheduled to open at home against Atlanta on Sept. 25. TEXAS PLAYER TO TRANSFER -- Ramonce Taylor, who scored 15 touchdowns last season for the University of Texas while playing running back and wide receiver, said he planned to transfer, though he gave no indication where he might go. Taylor missed spring practice because of academic problems and was arrested in May on a marijuana possession charge. BASKETBALL LIBERTY ENDS SKID -- Cathrine Kraayeveld tied a career high with 22 points and grabbed 10 rebounds last night as the visiting Liberty defeated the Chicago Sky, 79-72, to snap a franchise-record 11-game losing streak. The Liberty improved to 5-20. The Sky (3-21) lost its seventh consecutive game. Becky Hammon, the Liberty's leading scorer, missed her seventh straight game with a sprained left ankle. TRACK AND FIELD RECORDS SET IN STOCKHOLM -- Asafa Powell of Jamaica and Jeremy Wariner of the United States broke stadium records at the DN Galan meet in Stockholm yesterday. Powell won the 100 meters in 9.86 seconds. Powell, who shares the world record, 9.77, with Justin Gatlin, surpassed Maurice Greene's Olympic Stadium record, 9.87, set in 1999. In the 400, Wariner, the Olympic and world champion, ran a 44.02 to break the stadium mark, 44.57, set by Alvin Harrison in 2002. RUSSIAN DISCUS STAR SUSPENDED 2 YEARS -- The Olympic women's discus champion Natalya Sadova of Russia was barred for two years yesterday by the International Association of Athletics Federations, track and field's world governing body, for a second doping violation. HOCKEY DEVILS' GOMEZ AWARDED $5 MILLION -- Devils forward Scott Gomez was awarded a one-year, $5 million contract by an arbitrator yesterday. Gomez posted career highs in goals (33) and points (84) last season, when he made $2.204 million. The Devils have 48 hours to accept the ruling and sign Gomez or let him become an unrestricted free agent. RANGERS TO PLAY IN PUERTO RICO -- The Rangers will travel to San Juan for Puerto Rico's inaugural N.H.L. game, an exhibition against the Florida Panthers at José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum on Sept. 23.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-12 Israel Says It Will Occupy Part of Southern Lebanon Israel says it will occupy a strip inside southern Lebanon with ground troops until an international force can take its place, raising the prospect of a more protracted Israeli involvement in Lebanon than its political and military leadership previously signaled or publicly sought. A1 Israeli military commanders say they are not surprised that incapacitating Hezbollah has been so difficult because the Lebanese militia is organized, well-trained, well-equipped and more like an army than an urban guerrilla force. A1 U.S. Troop Increase in Baghdad Saying that security in Baghdad remained ''terrible,'' President Bush announced an agreement with the prime minister of Iraq to significantly strengthen the American military presence in the city. A1 One of Iraq's most important treasures, looted in the ransacking of the National Museum three years ago, has been recovered in a clandestine operation involving the United States and turned over to Iraqi officials. A12 Typhoon Hits China Coast Typhoon Kaemi came ashore on the southern China coast, prompting the evacuation of more than 643,000 people in a region still recovering from an earlier storm that left more than 600 people dead. A6 Georgia Deploys Special Forces Georgia deployed special forces near the breakaway region of Abkhazia to arrest a local ruler who had declared autonomy from federal rule and to disperse a militia under his command. A11 NATIONAL A13-15 Senate Passes Bill Barring Help to Minors on Abortion The Senate passed legislation that would make it a federal crime to help an underage girl escape parental notification laws by crossing state lines to obtain an abortion. A1 Proposal for Terror Suspects A White House proposal on terrorism detainees would allow hearsay evidence unless it was deemed ''unreliable'' and would permit defendants to be excluded from their own proceedings if necessary to protect national security. A1 Rangers Face Urban Issues Assaults against forest rangers are soaring, and urban crime has spilled into the public land that surrounds many of the fastest-growing cities in the West. A1 Judge Dismisses AT&T Lawsuit A federal judge in Chicago dismissed a class-action lawsuit against AT&T that said it has illegally provided information about its customers to the National Security Agency. A13 New Rules for Air Controllers The Federal Aviation Administration has re-scheduled air traffic controllers at seven of its busiest radar offices to assure that at least 70 percent of the controllers on shift are always at their radar scopes. A14 Guards Seek to Unionize The Service Employees International Union is trying to unionize more than 70,000 security guards nationwide, a group that in many cities is more than 50 percent African-American. A13 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Power Network in Queens Was Shaky Before Failure The electrical network for the area of Queens where 100,000 people endured a lengthy blackout had the most failures of any of the 57 underground networks in New York City for the last two years, according to statistics that Consolidated Edison provided to state regulators. B1 Gang Arrests in New Jersey More than 60 people in New Jersey were arrested and more than 40 additional arrests were expected in a sweep that the authorities described as the biggest mass arrest of gang members ever to take place in the state. B1 Spitzer and Suozzi Debate The two Democratic candidates for governor of New York clashed relentlessly in their sole debate over tax cuts, gay marriage, the death penalty, marijuana, the Queens blackout, and even their own future presidential ambitions. B1 ARTS E1-8 Tate Modern Announces Annex Tate Modern unveiled plans for a $397 million extension intended to be completed in time for the 2012 Olympic Games in London. E3 OBITUARIES C12 H. Freeman Mathews Jr. A Foreign Service officer who helped lay the groundwork for the 1978 Camp David peace accords, he was 78. C12 BUSINESS DAY C1-11 Pfizer's New Heart Drug Pfizer says it will apply for approval to sell a promising new heart treatment as a stand-alone pill, rather than only in combination with Lipitor, Pfizer's best-selling cholesterol treatment. C1 Slowing Home Sales Sales of both new and existing homes are slackening, and experts say the housing industry appears to be moving from a boom to something that is starting to look like a bust. C1 Taxis in the Clouds With new air taxis, several companies aim to offer faster, more convenient air travel at a price that falls somewhere between private jets and commercial airlines.

VWhen Sheila Gold announces to her grown daughter, Rachel, that she is thinking of trading in her barely used Judaism for late-model, born-again Christianity, it looks as if we're being set up for a play about religious faith. But Gino DiIorio has something else up his sleeve in ''Apostasy,'' the absorbing but ultimately unsatisfying new drama running through Aug. 13 at the New Jersey Repertory Company in Long Branch. Sheila's flirtation with Jesus is going to turn into a flirtation of an entirely different kind. And abortion politics will intrude messily on the play's relationships. Not that anyone here is pregnant. ''Apostasy'' is set in Sheila's hospice room, all blond wood and pastels in Carrie Mossman's well-considered design. It's a space intended to help Sheila fade away quietly, as her cancer progresses beyond the reach of medicine. But Sheila, even in the too-sweet performance of Susan G. Bob, isn't the fading type. The hard-charging founder of a successful store called Sheila's Closet, she has sacrificed her family's needs to those of her business. Now, she finds herself unprepared to die. ''People who have faith die differently from people who don't,'' she tells Rachel.

VThe police in South Africa and Lesotho said they had arrested 264 people and seized a small mountain of contraband in a late July dragnet intended to curb smuggling between the nations. The confiscated goods included 47 tons of marijuana, 696 sheep, 61 goats, 60 head of cattle, 43 stolen automobiles, 11 firearms and some $10,000 in bootleg DVD\u2019s, the police superintendent for Free State Province in South Africa told the South African Press Association. Lesotho, a tiny kingdom landlocked by western South Africa, has porous borders that have made it a haven for criminals seeking to evade South African law enforcement.

VA fire tore through a home here late Wednesday, killing three children and their father, who had rushed back into the flames to try to save the youngsters, the authorities said. The blaze broke out in a two-story home outside Hoosick Falls, a village about 30 miles northeast of Albany. Brian Decatur, 41, and his wife, Cheryl, 38, escaped, but Mr. Decatur ran back into the house to try to save the children, the authorities said. They identified the children as Cade May and Haley Decatur, both 8, and Gardin Decatur, 2. The couple each had a child from a previous relationship and had Gardin together. Sixteen marijuana plants were found in the basement. The cause remains under investigation.

VA fire tore through a home here late Wednesday, killing three children and their father, who had rushed back into the flames to try to save the youngsters, the authorities said. The blaze broke out in a two-story home outside Hoosick Falls, a village...

VSelective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition. Theater Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater. Previews and Openings 'THE FANTASTICKS' In previews; opens on Aug. 16. If you were one of the people who missed the 17,162 performances of this show the last time around, good news: Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones's romantic musical, which closed in 2002, is back (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. 'INDIAN BLOOD' In previews; opens on Thursday. Primary Stages presents A. R. Gurney's new comedy about a rebellious boy coming of age in the 1940's. Mark Lamos directs (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. 'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' In previews; opens on Aug. 17. This musical sendup of biographical shows features Martin Short and an ensemble telling the story of his life. Mr. Short's beloved old characters, like Ed Grimley and Jiminy Glick, make appearances (2:15). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. MIDTOWN INTERNATIONAL THEATER FESTIVAL Through Sunday. This seventh annual showcase can all too easily get lost in the shuffle, despite its large and diverse collection of shows. There should be more than 60 productions this season, at four locations on 36th Street. Schedules and information: (212) 868-4444. 'MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Aug. 21. Meryl Streep plays the title character in Tony Kushner's translation of Brecht's seminal play about a world at war. Kevin Kline also stars, and George C. Wolfe directs (2:30). Delacorte Theater, Central Park. Free. Ticket information: (212) 539-8750. 'SEVEN GUITARS' In previews; opens Aug. 24. Signature Theater presents its first August Wilson revival since the playwright's death last year. Ruben Santiago-Hudson, who starred in the 1996 Broadway production, directs (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. Broadway 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THIS INTIMACY' In this not-very-deep comedy-drama by Rajiv Joseph, a 30-year-old poet impregnates not only his girlfriend, but also two other women, within two weeks. The women, once they meet, are surprisingly unimpressed with his notable virility (1:45). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422. (Neil Genzlinger) 'AMAJUBA: LIKE DOVES WE RISE' Tormenting memories dissolve into soaring music, and pain is salved by a collective embrace in this heartfelt, powerfully performed theater piece about life under apartheid. The recollections of the five cast members and authors are woven together with a cappella performances of spirituals from the apartheid years and vignettes performed by the full cast. The actors all but glow with a sense of mission, as if telling their stories has given them new purpose and power (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School. Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200 (1:10). (Anita Gates) 'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) 'SHOUT!' A mini-skirted, go-go booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the show room of a Carnival Cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A STONE CARVER' Despite the high cliché factor, William Mastrosimone's play about an Italian immigrant who is losing his house to a highway exit is timely and sporadically touching, in large part because of Dan Lauria's over-the-top performance as the title character and old-world patriarch who makes a mean barrel of wine and never talks when he can shout (1:40). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Andrea Stevens) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE & OTHER STORY BOOKS' This children's musical, made up of 10 sketches based on 8 books, is diverse, adorable and free. Also, the adults laugh (1:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 642-9033. (Gates) 'NEVER TELL' The computer-involved characters in James Christy's intriguing drama about trust, video art and a society-changing application can be irritating but they're never boring (1:50). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Gates) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where con men are king (see ''The Producers''). Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James as the mismatched swindlers (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'CLOUD TECTONICS' A solid rendition of Jose Rivera's thin fable about time, centering on a hitchhiking woman who has been pregnant for two years. Luis Vega is particularly good as the man who gives her a ride and shelter for the night (1:30). Culture Project-45 Below, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930's, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) 'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (Scott) 'BEEN RICH ALL MY LIFE' (No rating, 80 minutes) This admiring documentary portrait of the Silver Belles, an indefatigable troupe of veteran Harlem tap dancers between the ages of 84 and 96, is a valuable historical footnote and a useful how-to movie about making the most of old age. (Stephen Holden) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden) 'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott) 'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) 'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott) * 'Gabrielle' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeois Parisian marriage, about 1912. (Dargis) 'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems that Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over, and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden) * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden) 'I Like Killing Flies' (R, 79 minutes) The documentary filmmaker Matt Mahurin paints an engaging if glib portrait of Kenny Shopsin, of the legendary or notorious, depending on your experience, Greenwich Village eatery that bears his name. (Dargis) 'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden) 'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldly creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis) 'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Nathan Lee) * Little Miss Sunshine (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott) * 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott) * 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband, and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee) * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) 'PEACEFUL WARRIOR' (PG-13, 120 minutes) As ludicrous as the title promises, yet supremely unembarrassed, this New Age enlightenment parable has its heart in the right place, but a mind of corny mush. (Lee) 'The Photographer, His Wife, Her Lover' (Not rated, 79 minutes) Art, adultery, divorce, lawyers and pots of money. Paul Yule's documentary wades unproductively through the mess surrounding the estate of the Brooklyn-born photographer O. Winston Link, who died in 2001. (Holden) 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott) * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott) 'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis) * Scoop (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis) 'SHADOWBOXER' (R, 93 minutes) This garish thriller starring Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. as contract killers and lovers is an extravagance that leaves you with your mouth hanging open -- partly in admiration of its audacity and partly in disbelief at its preposterousness. (Holden) 'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott) 'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis) 'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis) '13 Tzameti' (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French new wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden) * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. (Dargis) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) You, Me and Dupree' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis) Film Series THE BEST OF BUSTER: KEATON COMEDY CLASSICS (Through Sept. 25) Film Forum's eight-week festival of the silent comedies of the brilliantly stone-faced Keaton (1895-1966) begins on Monday night. ''The General'' (1926), his version of the great Civil War locomotive chase, will be shown, along with three early-1920's shorts. Other films in the series include ''Sherlock Jr.'' (1924) and ''The Cameraman'' (1928). 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Anita Gates) FRANK BORZAGE, HOLLYWOOD ROMANTIC (Through Aug. 20) The 24-film retrospective of Borzage (1893-1962) continues at the Museum of the Moving Image with four films this weekend.

(Gates) NOW THAT'S HIP! (Through Aug. 29) As part of the River to River arts festival, the HIP Health Plan of New York is sponsoring outdoor screenings of movies set in New York, preceded by shorts from New York filmmakers. The four-movie August series begins on Tuesday with ''Barefoot in the Park'' (1967), in which Robert Redford and Jane Fonda play mismatched newlyweds in a minuscule downtown apartment. The other films, all to be shown on Tuesday nights, are ''Pickup on South Street'' (1953), ''Mr. Deeds Goes to Town'' (1936) and ''Rear Window'' (1954). Elevated Acre, 55 Water Street, (212) 835-2789; free. (Gates) PLAY IT LOUD: ROCK DOCS 2006 (Through Thursday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's nine-film series of rock-music documentaries rocks on. This weekend's films include ''Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out'' (2005), the history of the band as seen by its drummer, Stewart Copeland; and ''No Direction Home: Bob Dylan'' (2005), Martin Scorsese's portrait of the young Dylan. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) RAISING HELL: SAM PECKINPAH (Through Aug. 29) BAMcinématek's monthlong tribute to Peckinpah (1925-84) continues. Monday night's feature is ''The Getaway'' (1972), in which Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw rob a bank, badly.

''Captain Blood'' (1935), with Errol Flynn, and ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' (1935), with Leslie Howard, are on the bill for Friday and Saturday, to be shown with ''The Scarlet Pumpernickel'' (1950), starring the dashing Daffy Duck.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * CELEBRATE BROOKLYN AFRICAN FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) One of the highlights of the Celebrate Brooklyn schedule each summer is its daylong African concert, any 10 minutes of which is well worth the $3 suggested donation. This year features Kekele, a supergroup of Congolese rumba elders gathered à la ''Buena Vista Social Club,'' and Lagbaja, a Nigerian bandleader who plays muscular Afro-funk and hides his face in a scarf to symbolize Africa's political anonymity. (His name means ''anybody'' in Yoruban.) Others on the bill include Razia, a singer born in Madagascar and raised in Gabon; the African Underground All-Stars, a pan-African hip-hop collective whose M.C.'s include Chosan, from Sierra Leone, and Dola, of Tanzania; and Martino Atangana, a Cameroonian guitarist who lives in New York. From 2 to 9 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org. Lagbaja also plays at 8 and 11 p.m. on Wednesday at S.O.B.'s., 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Ben Sisario) MARSHALL CRENSHAW (Tuesday and Wednesday) Marshall Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970's styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all, the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. At 10 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500, rodeobar.com; no cover. (Jon Pareles) BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133, dannysgrandseapalace.com; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Stephen Holden) HAZEL DICKENS; BONNY BILLY AND CAPTAIN ANOMOANON (Tomorrow and Sunday) The daughter of a West Virginia coal miner, Hazel Dickens sings sharp and unadorned bluegrass songs about hardship and defiant proletarian pride. (''They'll never shoot that union out of me.'') Nineteen years ago she appeared in John Sayles's film ''Matewan'' alongside Will Oldham, who has since developed a postmodern Appalachian folk style. He performs as Bonny Billy (one of his many pseudonyms), along with his brother Ned, who appears as Captain Anomoanon. Tomorrow at 7 and 9:30 p.m., Sunday at 4 and 6:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; sold out tomorrow, $30 on Sunday. (Sisario) DIRTY DOZEN BRASS BAND (Tuesday) The magnificent ensemble that revitalized New Orleans brass-band music. It swaggers through the city's whole musical heritage: parades, rumba, swing, be-bop and modern jazz, for starters. Solos can head for the far side of tonality, but the band never loses touch with gutbucket, danceable funk. At 8:15 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza at Lincoln Center, Columbus Avenue at 64th Street, (212) 875-5766, lincolncenter.org; free. (Pareles) FORRÓ IN THE DARK (Wednesday) For more than three years now, this group has been leading one of New York's best and lowest-tech dance parties at the East Village bar Nublu. The groove is a humble and sexy two-beat dance from northeastern Brazil called forró, made with accordion, hand-held percussion and, since this is New York, whiffs of distorted electric guitar. At 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., 62 Avenue C, between Fourth and Fifth Streets, East Village, nublu.net; $10. (Sisario) DIAMANDA GALÁS (Thursday) She is invariably dressed in black, her face in witchy streaks of makeup, but Diamanda Galás needs only her voice to terrify, seduce and beguile. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory that ranges from darkened Johnny Cash ballads to her own chilling AIDS Masses. In the first of four shows at the new Spiegeltent downtown, she offers ''Long Black Veil,'' a program of morbid music by Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Ornette Coleman and others. At 6 p.m., Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $30. (Sisario) * HOT CHIP (Tonight) With wobbly electronic rhythms that seem to be made of melting jelly, and a strong command of the drippy disco ballad, this English group plays a kind of wistful but still snarky dance music. Get too lost in the beats and you'll miss smart gags like the oh-so-art-rock countdown of nonsense words in descending numbers of letters (''S-E-X-I-N-G, C-A-S-I-O, P-O-K-E''). With Oppenheimer. At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, seaportmusicfestival.com; free. (Sisario) JPMORGAN CHASE LATINO CULTURAL FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) This two-week multidisciplinary and multinational series in Queens winds up this weekend. The gritty, deep-voiced Cuban singer Albita performs tonight. Tomorrow features Inti-Illimani, a veteran Chilean group that plays traditional Andean songs, as well as African and Spanish hybrids. On Sunday Peru Negro, a big troupe of dancers and singers, traverses three centuries of Afro-Peruvian music. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m., Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 760-0064, queenstheatre.org; $35 tonight and Sunday, $30 tomorrow; $5 off when bought in advance. (Sisario) LATIN ALTERNATIVE MUSIC CONFERENCE (Tonight and tomorrow) This annual series of concerts and discussion panels began six years ago, when a few Latin pop stars stood atop the charts (Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez), a varied rock and electronic scene flourished underground, and ''rock en Español'' was a marketing buzzword.The situation now is much the same, with fewer buzzwords: Shakira is an international phenomenon, while most Latin rock artists remain largely unknown to English-speaking American audiences. This will be mulled extensively at the daytime panels, but the best proof of the scene's vitality is the music itself. This weekend offers two free shows: Tonight at Celebrate Brooklyn are the Venezuelan groove-rockers Los Amigos Invisibles; Los Bunkers, from Chile; and Belanova, an electro-pop group from Mexico. Tomorrow afternoon at Central Park SummerStage are Gustavo Cerati, the former leader of the Argentine rock heroes Soda Stereo; Calle 13, a Puerto Rican reggaetón group; and the Mexican Institute of Sound. Tonight at 7:30, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. Tomorrow at 3, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. Information: latinalternative.com. (Sisario) LL COOL J (Monday) One of the first bigger-than-the-block personalities of rap, LL Cool J still follows the same few guidelines of self-representation that have served him throughout his long career: appear shirtless as often as possible for photographers, title all your albums either after yourself (''Todd Smith,'' his latest, refers to his given name, James Todd Smith) or some superlative that Muhammad Ali might have used (''Phenomenon,'' ''Greatest of All Time''), and perform in as sweatily vigorous a way as you can. At 7:30 p.m., Wingate Field, Winthrop Street, between Brooklyn and Kingston Avenues, East Flatbush, Brooklyn, (718) 469-1912, brooklynconcerts.com; free. (Sisario) * MANU CHAO (Monday) This great globalist rocker makes a rare appearance. In the 1980's, Manu Chao, a musical omnivore born in France to Spanish parents, led the pioneering Latin rock band Mano Negra, which fused the angry political punk of the Clash with flamenco and Algerian rai. Since the late 90's, despite minimal output, he has been a celebrated and inspirational symbol of high-minded, do-it-yourself multiculturalism: he dabbles in reggae and dub, rap, salsa, calypso and rock, and recently produced the eclectic Malian duo Amadou and Mariam. He plays a benefit concert for Celebrate Brooklyn, with Plastilina Mosh as the opening act. At 7 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell (see above); sold out. (Sisario) DAVE MATTHEWS BAND (Tomorrow and Sunday) His own private Bonnaroo: Dave Matthews has programmed two days of kindred spirits at Randalls Island, a minifestival with a much more manageable seven bands instead of seven dozen. Both days feature the Dave Matthews Band, the robotically virtuosic banjoing of Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, the three-cheers-for-marijuana ska of Slightly Stoopid, and the Grateful Dead-influenced Tea Leaf Green. Tomorrow also has the mighty Southern rockers Gov't Mule, and on Sunday David Gray, the British singer-songwriter whose ballads mingle acoustic guitar and gentle electronica, will perform. At noon, Randalls Island, near Icahn Stadium, 1 Randalls Island, randallsislandconcerts.com, (212) 307-7171; sold out tomorrow, $55 and $62.50 on Sunday. (Sisario) THE MIGHTY SPARROW (Tuesday) With wry lyrics and supple melodies, the Mighty Sparrow, who was born Slinger Francisco, made the carnival music of Trinidad and Tobago a political force and a pop phenomenon with a string of competition-winning hit songs that stretches back to the mid-1950's in which he comments on everything from the Shah to the first black Miss Universe. At 7 p.m., Queensbridge Park, Queens, (212) 360-8290, cityparksfoundation.org; free. (Pareles) NEWPORT FOLK FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) In a way, this veteran festival, home of ''We Shall Overcome'' singalongs and Bob Dylan's 1965 electric crossing, is one of the most creatively programmed in the country. To expand the idea of folk music -- or at least to fill up the weekend at a time when folk groups are in small supply -- Newport folds in jazz, soul, even greasy funk. Tonight's concert has more traditional fare, with Ronan Tynan and Cherish the Ladies, both from Ireland. On tomorrow's roster are David Gray, Rosanne Cash, Bettye LaVette, Sonny Landreth, Sonya Kitchell, Mary Gauthier and others; Sunday features the Indigo Girls, the veteran New Orleans funk group the Meters, Madeleine Peyroux, Keller Williams and Odetta. Absent: any representation of the vital, young and underground ''freak folk'' movement. Tonight at 8, at the International Tennis Hall of Fame; tomorrow and Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Fort Adams State Park, Newport, R.I., (401) 847-3700, newportfolk.com; $30 to $75 tonight; $59 tomorrow and Sunday. (Sisario) ONE RING ZERO (Monday) This Brooklyn band has set words by authors like Jonathan Lethem, Margaret Atwood and Rick Moody to kitchen-sink songs with toy piano and theremin. The group offers a screening of ''As Smart as They Are,'' a documentary about its formation. At 8 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $20; $10 for members. (Sisario) GRANT-LEE PHILLIPS (Thursday) Mr. Phillips harks back to the earnest ambitions and expansive melodies of Bob Dylan and John Lennon, singing with the conviction that rock can still be heroic. Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Pareles) THE RED KRAYOLA (Tuesday) The first album of the Red Crayola (as it was originally spelled) appeared in 1967, and Mayo Thompson has held on to its skewed psychedelic perspective ever since; he also spent some years as a member of Pere Ubu. He's fond of dissolving song structures, crypto-Marxist messages and woozy sounds, and when he reconvened the Red Krayola (the spelling was changed to avoid trademark problems) in 1994, he found fans and collaborators among progressive- and post-rock musicians. With Coyote, featuring members of the bands Vaz and Man Man. At 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $12. (Pareles) * CANDI STATON (Wednesday) She has been a disco queen, a raw-voiced soul belter and, for much of the last two decades, a gospel singer. But Ms. Staton's greatest success has been with record collectors, who have kept her strong legacy of secular R & B alive and may have persuaded her to return to it: she recently released ''His Hands'' (Honest Jon's/Astralwerks), a stirring album of broken-heart songs and rich Southern blues that is her first such recording in decades. This concert is billed as Ms. Staton's first in New York in more than 20 years. With Stephanie McKay. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $25. (Sisario) WARPED TOUR (Tomorrow) Now 12 years old, this skateboards-punk-and-tattoos circus includes Thursday, From Autumn to Ashes, Against Me!, Helmet, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, the Sounds, Motion City Soundtrack, NOFX, Bouncing Souls, Damone, Saves the Day, Senses Fail and the Academy Is , Every Time I Die and many, many more. Best band name: Gym Class Heroes. Worst: Gatsby's American Dream. At noon, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, warpedtour.com; $35. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. MONTY ALEXANDER JAZZ AND ROOTS ENSEMBLE (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Alexander's most recent album, ''Concrete Jungle'' (Telarc), pays tribute to his celebrated countryman Bob Marley. He travels similar territory here, featuring his piano and melodica playing in a buoyant ensemble with Wendel Ferraro on guitar and vocals, Hassan Shakur on bass and George Fludas on drums. Through Aug. 13. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Nate Chinen) JEFF BALLARD AND MARK TURNER (Tonight) Mr. Ballard, a drummer, and Mr. Turner, a tenor saxophonist, constitute two-thirds of Fly, a brainy yet earthy group that seeks adventure in collective interplay. Without a bassist or any harmonic accompaniment, their rapport at this performance should be stark and inspired. At 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) SAM BARDFELD'S STUFF SMITH PROJECT (Thursday) Mr. Bardfeld is a violinist with a wide-ranging résumé who spent all of June on tour with Bruce Springsteen's ''Seeger Sessions'' band. Here he pays tribute to a swing-era hero of his instrument, with help from the pianist Anthony Coleman and the bassist Brad Jones. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) SAM BARSH (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Barsh is a keyboardist with a gift for groove, as he has demonstrated on recent albums by the bassist Avishai Cohen and the guitarist Jeff Parker. Performing on a new jazz series with a Hudson River view, he enlists Tim Collins on vibraphone, Ari Folman-Cohen on bass and Jaimeo Brown on drums. At 9 and 10:30, the River Room, Riverbank State Park, Riverside Drive at 145th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 491-1500, theriverroomofharlem.com; no cover. (Chinen) BEDROCK (Tonight) The keyboardist Uri Caine, the bassist Tim Lefebvre and the drummer Zach Danziger make up this trio, which absorbs elements of fusion, funk and drum-and-bass into its own deliriously groovy style. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) This little big band, led by the irrepressible slide trumpeter Steven Bernstein, has a new album called ''MTO Volume 1'' (Sunnyside) that's full of signature touches, like effervescent swing arrangements and covers of hits by Prince and Stevie Wonder. At 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $12. (Chinen) DAVID BINNEY (Tuesday and Wednesday) This alto saxophonist pursues an avant-gardism that embraces harmony, melody and rhythm, along with amplification. He performs in two different settings next week, first with his group Balance (on Tuesday) and then with a more experimental crew (on Wednesday). Tuesday at 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. Wednesday at 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) * CARAMOOR JAZZ FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) Roughly 50 miles upstate, this festival offers some smartly simple programming in a tented open-air environment.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States in a garrulous, very personal way. One particularly intense work, based on the belief that Abubakari II, ruler of Mali, crossed the Atlantic nearly 200 years before Columbus to discover the Americas, links the past with the present and Africa with the beloved Columbus of Ms. Robinson's childhood.

Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606 or daheshmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 or frick.org. (Holland Cotter) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestoes and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500 or guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) * INternational Center of Photography: 'On Air,' through Aug. 27. The South Korean artist Atta Kim's best-known body of work is a series called ''The Museum Project'' (1995-2002), for which he photographed his human subjects -- families, nude couples, maimed war veterans -- locked inside plexiglass exhibition cases like specimens on display. The series eventually took a religious turn, with models posing as Buddhist deities. The pictures here, in his first major American solo show, continue this spiritual trajectory. Filmed using long exposure times, figures, landscapes and religious icons have been turned into apparitions. People, art and museums may last for a while, Mr. Kim seems to say, but all things eventually melt away. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 or icp.org. (Cotter) * metropolitan museum of art: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early-19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. History is full of shifty characters, antique visionaries, cusp figures and half-crazy oddball innovators, later overlooked because they're hard to pigeonhole. Their independent cast of mind is the truest expression of how civilization advances. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * Met: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 4 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Smith) * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of a kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. Many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Cotter) Museum of Biblical Art: 'The Word on the Street: the photographs of Larry Racioppo,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500 or mobia.org. (Ken Johnson) * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Smith) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Kimmelman) NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer, , through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 or neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman) New York Botanical Garden: Chihuly at the New York Botanical Garden, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700 or nybg.org. (Johnson) * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. A large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 or nyhistory.org. (Cotter) New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. Concentrating on books, but also including prints and drawings, it retells the tale of the French avant-garde on a relatively egalitarian playing field. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 or nypl.org. (Smith) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/Out of Me,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 or ps1.org. (Johnson) * Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000 or rmanyc.org. (Cotter) * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 or whitney.org. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea * A BROKEN ARM The title is a tribute to Duchamp. The works review various strategies of using found objects or images in photography, painting and sculpture. The seven artists include Gedi Sibony, Arnold Odermatt and Karen Kalimnik. All has been orchestrated by Mari Spirito, the gallery's director. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith) * DERECONSTRUCTION Matthew Higgs, director of the alternative space White Columns, has assembled a handsome show that in typical Higgs fashion brings together outsider, emerging, hip and formerly hip artists. Variations on collage and assemblage predominate without feeling stale. The larger point: deconstruction has had its day, and it is time to start putting things back together again. The putters range from A. R. Penck and Lucas Samaras to Carter and Alexandra Bircken. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9301, gladstonegallery.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith) * J. Bennett Fitts: 'No Lifeguard on Duty' Symbolically resonant photographs of mostly derelict motel swimming pools by a young Californian. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com, through Aug. 11. (Johnson) * FOUNTAINS A summery theme is tweaked by energetic efforts. High points include Daniel Lefcourt's eye-popping photograph of studio tools, Sanford Bigger's video of a disco ball and Gibb Slife's television set, whose do-it-yourself antenna suggests spreading vines or brain waves. The low points seem to have been left out. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com, through Aug. 11. (Smith) * 'A Four-Dimensional Being Writes Poetry on a Field with Sculptures' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com, through Aug. 11. (Johnson) * GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES The well-known Cologne art gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. That may be the point. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith) Michael Heizer Sculptures in concrete representing prehistoric hand tools much enlarged so that they resemble Modernist sculptures by a follower of Brancusi. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 421-3292 or pacewildenstein.com, through Sept. 23. (Johnson) 'Materiality' Inventive works made of all sorts of materials in this show include a stuffed leather-and-plywood tree by Carolyn Salas; a geometric landscape with a slowing-moving, wartlike kinetic element, covered in reflective Mylar, by Charlotte Becket; a neat display of more than 200 pieces of breakfast cereal by Tom Friedman; and a sumptuous stuffed object resembling a much-enlarged amoeba by Ernesto Neto. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com, through Aug. 25. (Johnson) MEN This show of 10 paintings of men by 10 women, organized by the painter Ellen Altfest, covers a lot of stylistic ground and includes an only partly tongue-in-cheek denunciation from the lesbian collective Redykeulous. Realism makes the strongest impression. I-20, 557 West 23rd Street, (212) 645-1100, I-20.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith) * Howardena Pindell: 'In My Lifetime' Thirty years ago, Howardena Pindell was well known for meditative, process-based abstract work, though her art has always had two aspects. In the 1970's and 80's it assumed and maintained an overtly political direction in large-scale pieces that combined abstraction, words and figures to deal with social and political issues, from AIDS and homelessness to the present war in Iraq. Both types are in this informal gallery retrospective, which makes clear how thoroughly they are based on -- emerge from, are fueled and inflected by -- the individual experiences and memories of the artist herself. G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 316, (212) 929-6645, grnnamdi.com, through Aug. 31. (Cotter) A RABBIT AS KING OF THE GHOSTS With a title lifted from Wallace Stevens, this elegant show posits photography as the leading ghost in the machine of contemporary art and draws visually telling analogies from 140 years of the medium's life span. It has been organized by the photographers Justine Kurland and Dan Torop. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, through Aug. 11. (Smith) TWO FRIENDS AND SO ON Selected by asking one artist to invite another, who asked another, until a group of 30 had accrued, this show winds from Conceptual-based work through abstract painting and sculpture, and back again, presenting a random cross-section of the art world and displaying a network of style-based alliances. It is a quite a ride. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com, through Aug. 12. (Smith) 'WAR ON 45/MY MIRRORS ARE PAINTED BLACK (FOR YOU)' The latest word from the boys in black is a show of six artists organized by the head boy, Banks Violette. The stark glamour of it cannot be denied, but it looks too much like graphic design. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Sept. 2. (Smith) Other Galleries 'Gifts Go in One Direction' With art selling so briskly these days, isn't it time for the art world to hand out some gift bags, some freebies? After all, artists, as members of an intensively networked and mutually supportive community, have been giving one another gifts. That is the subject of this charming summer show, which takes the form of a round-robin of generosity, with artists on both the giving and receiving ends. Apexart, 291 Church Street, near Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, through Aug. 12. (Cotter) Last Chance * Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Mr. Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050 or tibordenagy.com; closes today. (Johnson)

VPutting Shakespearean characters in modern dress and contemporary situations is such a tired idea. Once you've seen Hamlet in a corporate boardroom, you've seen them all. But ''ShakespeaRe-Told,'' BBC America's series of four adaptations, has been winning positive reviews despite its hideous title. Last week the series turned Beatrice and Benedick of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' into rival television news co-anchors. And this week it sets ''MACBETH'' (Sunday at 7 p.m.) in an elegant British restaurant that has just been awarded three Michelin stars. Now that's power. Joe Macbeth (JAMES McAVOY), the gifted chef, and his wife, Ella (KEELEY HAWES), the gracious maître d', do all the work, but the owner, Duncan (VINCENT REGAN), gets all the glory. Therefore Duncan is not long for this world. This production makes it clear why reality series set in restaurant kitchens work so well. And not just because there are so many sharp knives around. It's hard out there for a suburban marijuana dealer like Nancy Botwin. If the second-season premiere of ''WEEDS'' (Monday at 10 p.m. on Showtime) is any indication, it's going to get harder. Nancy (MARY-LOUISE PARKER), who is just trying to maintain her family's upper-middle-class life now that she's a widow, wakes up in the bed of the new guy in her life (MARTIN DONOVAN) and learns he's a D.E.A. agent. The episode also includes a car crash, a suspicious fire, a family member's decision to become a rabbi and Nancy's business associates' decision to branch out. Oh, dear. It's another inspiring real-life tale of a noble teacher who gives all to salvage the self-esteem of disadvantaged children. But ''THE RON CLARK STORY'' (TNT, Sunday, 8 p.m.) has two things going for it: MATTHEW PERRY, who has transcended his lovable but lightweight ''Friends'' persona, and a more believable script than the usual television-movie treacle. Some of the time.

VThe Connecticut shot heard 'round the word continues to reverberate. The Washington Post says things are going from bad to worse for Republicans in the Northeast and takes a closer look at what it all means for 2008. The whole thing is sending ripples through local Nutmeg races as Lieberman's closest adviser urges him to stay the course.

VProsecutors announced two sets of indictments yesterday related to separate investigations at the Amsterdam Houses, a housing project near Lincoln Center. In the first, prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office charged 10 people who they said were members of the Bloods street gang with selling crack cocaine and marijuana at the project and stashing their drugs in stairwells and lobbies. In the second indictment, three men were charged with different crimes after a fatal stabbing at the project last Thursday. One of them, Joel Cabrera, 18, was indicted on a charge of second-degree murder in the stabbing of Willie Stroud, prosecutors said. Another was charged with assault and the third with burglary. Prosecutors said Mr. Stroud was killed after he took part in a home-invasion robbery of Mr. Cabrera\u2019s apartment.

VNew York is a city that wants you to look closely - often at itself. It has a fervent interest in itself and its denizens in a way that few other cities can match. It's hard to imagine a Peorian and a Syracusan nearly coming to blows over the relative merits of their cities' cuisine, as a New Yorker and Chicagoan did on a recent flight I was on.

VIn an article in the Israeli daily Haaretz about the recent Lebanon war, a Likud member of Parliament, Yuval Steinitz, argued that the Israeli Defense Forces have put too much faith in air power and neglected ground-war capabilities. In recent years, a concept of ''victory from the air'' developed, negating the need for ground maneuvers or improved firepower on ground or in sea. In the case of Lebanon, a specific concept of repelling Katyusha rockets and missile fire in the air was developed -- hence, the belief that it was possible to conduct a broad confrontation with Hezbollah with no action on the ground.

''I had a 13-year-old in here yesterday with her mother and she didn't want anything but sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll,'' said Diane Garrett, owner of Diane's Books of Greenwich.

Students from bordering communities like Port Chester, N.Y., and Stamford, Conn., keep striving to land seats in Greenwich classrooms. Who can blame them?

VTo the Editor: Re ''Lighting Up in Amsterdam'' (column, Aug. 26): John Tierney quotes Peter Cohen, a Dutch researcher and a former director of the Center for Drug Research at the University of Amsterdam, as saying that ''drug policy is irrelevant'' because America, with strict drug laws, is said to have no less drug use than the free-wheeling Europeans. The facts tell a different story. Consider the rates of current marijuana use by young people here and abroad.

VWillie Nelson in Drug Bust Willie Nelson and several members of his band were issued misdemeanor citations for drug possession early yesterday at a traffic stop on Interstate 10 near Breaux Bridge in St. Martin Parish, La., The Associated Press reported. State Trooper Willie Williams said troopers noticed a strong odor of marijuana when the driver opened the bus door, and about 1.5 pounds of marijuana and about 3 ounces of mushrooms were found during a search. Mr. Nelson, 73, right, of Spicewood, Tex., and four members of his band were released after they were given the citations. Crocodile Hunter Memorial Prime Minister John Howard of Australia, below, is to attend the public memorial service tomorrow for Steve Irwin, television's popular Crocodile Hunter, who died at 44 on Sept. 4 when his heart was pierced by a stingray barb while making a documentary. John Stainton, Mr. Irwin's manager, producer and longtime friend, said he was determined that the event, to be attended by some 5,500 people and televised live around the world, would not degenerate into a circus, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Stainton declined to divulge details of the memorial at the ''Crocoseum'' at Mr. Irwin's Australia Zoo, north of Brisbane, but said yesterday: ''It's very loose at the moment. I just want it to happen and everyone to enjoy it, and that's it.'' Gish Prize Winner Chosen An Iranian-born artist who lives in New York has been named the winner of the 2006 Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize of about $300,000 and a silver medallion. The artist, Shirin Neshat, left, whose photographs, films and projections explore Islam and gender relations, will receive her awards at a ceremony on Oct. 12 at the Hudson Theater, where scenes from her feature film work will be shown. The Gish Prize, named for the sisters best known for their performances in silent films, is given annually ''to a man or woman who has made an outstanding contribution to the beauty of the world and to mankind's enjoyment and understanding of life.'' Previous winners include Bob Dylan, Ingmar Bergman and Arthur Miller. New Tolkien Epic Coming Fans of J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings,'' have a new epic to look forward to. Houghton Mifflin announced yesterday that it had acquired the American rights to publish ''The Children of Hurin.'' Begun in 1918, it was a tale that Tolkien, right (1892-1973), worked on throughout his life and will take his readers once more among elves and men and dragons and dwarfs. Houghton Mifflin said in an announcement that although it had long been assumed that ''The Children of Hurin'' would remain unfinished, it had been reconstructed and edited by Tolkien's son Christopher, working from Tolkien's many drafts. Publication is scheduled for spring. Andrew Lloyd Webber Defends Maria Andrew Lloyd Webber has struck back at critics who are carping about the number of times his Maria, chosen in a televised contest, will sing weekly when his new production of ''The Sound of Music'' opens in London in November. Discussing plans for the winner, Connie Fisher, 23, right, to sing at the Palladium in six of the eight weekly performances, he said it was his ''duty'' to protect her voice, the BBC reported, and he added that it was ''absolutely normal'' for a young leading lady to sing fewer than eight performances weekly. ''This was the case when Sarah Brightman starred in 'The Phantom of the Opera' at the age of 22,'' he said. ''It was the same for Elaine Paige in 'Evita' and is true of Elena Roger, who is starring in the new production of 'Evita.' '' Ms. Fisher told BBC News: ''I would love to do eight shows a week. But I have to test my stamina.'' Baritone Wins in Toulouse A Chinese baritone, Song-Hu Liu, has won the top prize at the 46th international singing contest held every two years in Toulouse, France, Agence France-Presse reported. A first prize was not awarded to any of the six female finalists, but Elisabeth Donovan, a British soprano, was awarded second place. Mr. Song-Hu received a Sèvres vase and $8,200 donated by the city of Toulouse. Past winners in the contest, first held in 1324 and resurrected in 1954, include José Van Dam and Elena Vassilieva. Prisoners Build a Bohème Prisoners in Italy and Ireland have become opera aficionados, designing and making the sets and costumes to be used in a staging of Puccini's ''Bohème'' by Opera Ireland, Ireland's national opera company, in Dublin in mid-November, Reuters reported. The project, originating in 2004 at the high-security Maiano prison in Perugia, Italy, involves a collaboration between it and Mountjoy Prison in Dublin, where inmates have spent six months working from designs created by the Italians. ''They're all very proud of the work they're doing in Mountjoy, and they're learning new skills which they can use when they leave prison,'' said Conleth Teevan, a spokesman for Opera Ireland. He indicated that some prisoners would be allowed to attend the opera and that the rest would see it on video.

VIn December 1971, John Lennon sang at an Ann Arbor, Mich., concert calling for the release of a man who had been given 10 years in prison for possessing two marijuana cigarettes. The song he wrote for the occasion, ''John Sinclair,'' was remarkably effective. Within days, the Michigan Supreme Court ordered Mr. Sinclair released. What Lennon did not know at the time was that there were F.B.I. informants in the audience taking notes on everything from the attendance (15,000) to the artistic merits of his new song. (''Lacking Lennon's usual standards,'' his F.B.I. file reports, and ''Yoko can't even remain on key.'') The government spied on Lennon for the next 12 months, and tried to have him deported to England.

Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. Broadway 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ASYLUM: THE STRANGE CASE OF MARY LINCOLN' This musical telling of the real-life tale of the former first lady and how her son had her committed to an asylum in 1875 has some structural problems and could use more exposition by June Bingham, the book writer, but some of Carmel Owen's songs are decent, and the saga has a pull to it (1:45). The Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman) 'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'THE MAN HIMSELF' Ami Dayan stars in his own adaptation of Alan Drury's play about an average man's slide into religious fanaticism. An unsettling tale of everyday alienation and its potentially dangerous consequences (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) * 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) 'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting a series of fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'I 3/5sheart 4/5 KANT' Ken Urban's nimble, knowing one-act is about four women (a graduate student, a heroin addict, a depressive and a bombing victim), the men in their lives and the little humiliations and unexpected certainties of daily existence (1:10). Linhart Theater at 440 Studios, 440 Lafayette Street, near Astor Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates) 'intellectuals' Scott C. Sickles's comedy about a woman who decides to try lesbianism and how it affects her husband has lots of great lines, though the director, David Gautschy, and some of the actors aren't up to the pacing challenge. Ellen Dolan of ''As the World Turns'' is appealing in the lead, though (2:05). The Workshop Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 695-4173. (Genzlinger) 'nami' Chad Beckim's well-acted but overheated drama is about two dysfunctional couples whose fates intersect tragically (2:00). Kirk Theater, Theater Row Studios, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) Spectacles 'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims for a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette) 'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'FOGGY BOTTOM' James Armstrong's comedy about a Washingtonian who seduces women by promising them green cards has a nice sense of the ridiculous, but sometimes the action is unbelievable, even by the standards of farce (2:00). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates) 'FRINGE NYC ENCORES' Ten hits from the New York International Fringe Festival return for a second run at two theaters. Shows include ''Billy the Mime,'' ''Walmartopia,'' ''Broken Hands,'' ''Danny Boy,'' ''Open House'' and others. The 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village; Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMERICAN HARDCORE' (R, 98 minutes) The documentary history of the American hardcore punk rock movement that flourished as an underground in the first half of the 1980's is as swift and jagged as the defiant music it remembers with an encyclopedic thoroughness. (Stephen Holden) 'AURORA BOREALIS' (R, 110 minutes) Miserable in Minneapolis, a damaged slacker finds his life heating up when he connects with the nurse looking after his grandfather. Juliette Lewis stirs up this affable rubbish with a performance that hints that she can play more than sexpots and psychopaths. (Nathan Lee) 'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis) 'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, this film is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Holden) 'CONFETTI' (R, 94 minutes) In this mildly amusing mock documentary, three engaged couples compete in a British bridal magazine's contest for most original wedding concept. ''Best in Show,'' the movie's obvious inspiration, it's not. (Holden) 'THE COVENANT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The director Renny Harlin proves that ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was not the nadir of his career with this thriller about boy witches fending off a nefarious transfer student. (Lee) 'CRANK' (R, 83 minutes) A poisoned hit man rampages in Los Angeles, doling revenge on his nemesis and misanthropy on all. Basically a broken-down retread of ''Speed,'' with Jason Stratham as the bus. (Lee) 'CROSSOVER' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Bling is bad, and friends are good in this story of temptation, rivalry and cheerleaders, set in the world of Detroit street basketball. (Lee) 'EVERYONE'S HERO' (G, 88 minutes) Animated in name only, ''Everyone's Hero'' follows a 10-year-old baseball fanatic as he tries to return Babe Ruth's stolen bat. Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting, the movie is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. But since this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve, the movie's sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn't deserve. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis) 'AL FRANKEN: GOD SPOKE' (No rating, 90 minutes) This portrait of the comedian turned liberal polemicist is interesting as a case study in ideological celebrity, but not illuminating enough to be of interest to anyone but Mr. Franken's die-hard loyalists. (A. O. Scott) 'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis) * 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis) 'HAVEN' (R, 98 minutes) Class, race and preposterous narrative contrivance mix it up in the Cayman Islands in this nonlinear nonsense from the producer of ''Crash.'' (Lee) 'HOLLYWOODLAND' (R, 126 minutes) A fictional look at the life and downward-spiraling times of George Reeves, the man who played Superman on television and is here played by a fine Ben Affleck. Allen Coulter directs Paul Bernbaum's screenplay, which features a dead-end parallel plot about a detective (Adrien Brody). (Dargis) 'HOME' (No rating, 78 minutes) In Jeffrey M. Togman's marvelously revealing documentary, Sheree Farmer, a single mother of six, is offered the opportunity to escape her gang-infested neighborhood in Newark. An affordable new home in a safe area awaits; but as the mortgage deadline approaches, and Ms. Farmer's troubles mount, the movie brilliantly illuminates the psychological damage inflicted by years of deprivation. When survival hinges on trusting no one but yourself, the kindness of strangers can seem too good to be true. (Catsoulis) 'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis) 'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis) * 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden) * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott) 'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis) 'KEEPING MUM' (R, 90 minutes) Maggie Smith stars as a homicidal housekeeper and a Mary Poppins type in this British black comedy. An old-fashioned movie, it exudes the comfy familiarity of a vintage episode of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' (Holden) 'ARTIE LANGE'S BEER LEAGUE' (R, 86 minutes) Mr. Lange, Howard Stern's radio sidekick, somehow manages to make beer-league softball seem no fun at all in this extremely lowbrow comedy. High point: a brief appearance by the guy who played the beloved and now dead Edgar on ''24.'' (Neil Genzlinger) * 'LASSIE' (PG, 100 minutes) Everything old is new again in the 11th film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang. Blissfully restored to the period and location of Eric Knight's original novel -- pre-World War Britain -- the movie balances humor and pathos with old-fashioned charm and not a trace of satire. (Catsoulis) 'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'MAN PUSH CART' (No rating, 87 minutes) The Sisyphean daily grind of a Pakistani immigrant who sells coffee, doughnuts and bagels from a cart in Midtown Manhattan is an exemplary work of independent filmmaking carried out on a shoestring. At its best, it suggests an American ''Bicycle Thief.'' (Holden) * 'MUTUAL APPRECIATION' (No rating, 110 minutes) Andrew Bujalski's wonderful independent film about friendship in the modern world looks like something that came out of a time capsule, but there's nothing dusty about it. Shot on expressively grainy black-and-white celluloid, it is the sort of unassuming discovery that could suffer from too much big love, and while it won't save or change your life, it may make your heart swell. Its aim is modest and true. (Dargis) * 'OLD JOY' (No rating, 76 minutes) Two old friends drive out of Portland, Ore., one day and into a strained reunion in Kelly Reichardt's ''Old Joy,'' a triumph of modesty and of seriousness that also happens to be one of the finest American films of the year. (Dargis) * 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis) 'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction, while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark epithet. (Dargis) * 'THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED' (No rating, 97 minutes) Kirby Dick, with the help of a private detective, investigates the mysterious workings of the Motion Picture Association of America, a highly secretive, deeply irrational organization with enormous influence over what we see -- and don't see -- on movie screens. (Scott) 'THE U.S. vs JOHN LENNON' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Using archival clips -- including some great ''Dick Cavett Show'' appearances and in-bed news conferences -- and talking-head interviews with Noam Chomsky, G. Gordon Liddy and many people in between, this documentary makes the case that John Lennon was a much better person than Richard Nixon. (Scott) 'VAJRA SKY OVER TIBET' (No rating, 89 minutes) Limited almost exclusively to tourist attractions, this documentary glimpse at the sights and sounds of occupied Tibet amounts to a rhetorically inflated vacation video -- but what a vacation! (Lee) 'the WICKER MAN' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In remaking a 1973 British horror classic, Neil LaBute once again demonstrates his misogyny and, worse, his technical incompetence. (Scott) Film Series THE BEST OF BUSTER: KEATON COMEDY CLASSICS (Through Monday) Film Forum's eight-week festival of the silent comedies of the brilliantly stone-faced Keaton (1895-1966) ends Monday night with ''The Cameraman'' (1928), about a man trying to impress a pretty office worker at MGM, and ''Spite Marriage'' (1929), about a dry cleaner in love with a stage star. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Anita Gates) ÉCLATS DE RIRE (Through Oct. 31) The French Institute Alliance Française is currently screening French comedy classics every Tuesday. This week's film is Francis Veber's odd-couple story ''La Chèvre'' (1981), starring Gérard Depardieu and Pierre Richard as a detective and a publicist on a kidnapping case. Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160; $10. (Gates) MADE IN NY (Through Dec. 31) Tomorrow, just in time for autumn in New York, the Museum of Modern Art begins a three-month series of notable films made in the city. This weekend's five movies include Woody Allen's ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986), whose Manhattan locations include Mia Farrow's Upper West Side apartment, and Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing'' (1989), set in a racially charged Brooklyn neighborhood. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) PYTHONALOT (Through Oct. 5) Film Forum's two-week Monty Python festival begins today with a weeklong run of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' (1975), the Arthurian lunacy that inspired the Broadway musical ''Spamalot.'' Other films in the series include the group's ''Life of Brian'' (1979), Terry Gilliam's ''Brazil'' (1985) and ''A Fish Called Wanda'' (1988), with Michael Palin and John Cleese. 209 West Houston Street, south of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AGENT ORANGE, REAGAN YOUTH (Tomorrow) The clock is ticking for CBGB, the legendary Bowery dive that was the cradle of punk: after a protracted dispute with its landlord, the club must vacate by the end of October. Its last few months have been shaping up as a reunion of the mid-80's class of Hardcore High, which continues tomorrow with the Southern California skate-punk of Agent Orange and members of Reagan Youth, a New York ''anarchy peace punk'' band that, among other things, equated ''the sons of Reagan'' with Nazis. (Its leader, Dave Insurgent, died 13 years ago.) Also on the bill are Freeze, Slacktone and Apple. At 7 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $20. (Ben Sisario) JOSEPH ARTHUR (Tuesday and Wednesday) Romance, despair and the struggle for faith intermingle in Mr. Arthur's haunting songs, which can float in a gorgeous but eerie acoustic reverie or flare up in electrified anger. His fifth album, ''Nuclear Daydream,'' has just been released on his own label, Lonely Astronaut. With Annie Stela. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18. (Sisario) * ASHFORD AND SIMPSON (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Steve and Eydie of pop-soul still put on a convincing and musically solid show of being the world's happiest show-business couple. At 8:30 and 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $60, with a $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden) BOBBY (BLUE) BLAND (Tomorrow) Mr. Bland's voice is a cornerstone of Memphis soul singing. In tones that are velvety, humble and long-suffering, he begs for affection with suave melancholy and smoldering fury. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles) JUSTIN BOND AND THE FREUDIAN SLIPPERS (Tonight) Fresh from a run on Broadway, Justin Bond, the peerlessly raunchy cabaret satirist better known as the Kiki half of Kiki & Herb, offers an account of his career, in music and video. At midnight, Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $25. (Sisario) CIBELLE (Tonight and tomorrow) Cibelle, a young Brazilian who lives in London, follows sensuous melodies into slippery electronic dream realms. And when she interprets the classics, she does it with a free hand: her version of Caetano Veloso's expatriate lament ''London, London'' on her new album ''The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves'' (Six Degrees) seizes on the line about ''flying saucers in the sky,'' adding more than a minute of psychedelic, sci-fi sound effects. Tonight at 7:30 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20. Tomorrow night at 10:30, with Barra Libre, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH, ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI (Thursday) Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, the grassroots rock success story of 2005 -- this band from Brooklyn sold tens of thousands of CD's of jerky, Talking Heads-inspired art-pop without a record label -- adds another trophy to its case with a performance at Rumsey Playfield in Central Park. If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like Architecture in Helsinki, from Australia: frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time. At 5 p.m., midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171; $32.50. (Sisario) ERIC CLAPTON (Thursday) This evergreen guitar hero, now 61, is touring with a repertory stretching back to his Derek and the Dominos era. Also on the bill is Robert Cray, the slick guitarist who was the great commercial hope of the blues in the 1980's. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $49.50 to $154.50. (Sisario) * DENGUE FEVER (Tonight) If you missed Cambodia's wildly eclectic psychedelic rock scene in the 1960's and early 70's (which came to a sudden end with the arrival of the Khmer Rouge), this adventurous Los Angeles band offers the next best thing. Featuring the forceful and entrancing vocals of Chhom Nimol -- a former Cambodian pop star who had been singing in a restaurant in Long Beach, Calif. -- it plays vintage hits and original songs in Khmer and English, toying with a listener's sense of exoticism and familiarity. At 11:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) FLAMING LIPS (Sunday and Monday) The first sign that it will not be the usual rock concert: the place fills with oversize balloons. Next: dancers seemingly dressed as Hebrew prophets. And if another is necessary, the highlight of the night is a cathartic, audience-participation version of ''Bohemian Rhapsody.'' At 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $40. (Sisario) HEM, FREEDY JOHNSTON (Tomorrow) A night of songwriting versus atmosphere. Hem plays somewhat prosaic alt-country, but in such delicate, luscious arrangements that it doesn't matter. Mr. Johnston is a master miniaturist whose elegant, deadpan stories of the lovelorn and the cruel are set to generic and innocuous folk-pop. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $23.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario) JET (Wednesday) Determined to boil rock down to its AC/DC-meets-Guns-N'-Roses essence, this Australian band dismisses anything that distracts from that goal -- including innovation. With Diamond Nights. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) JOHN BROWN'S BODY (Tomorrow) A reggae band founded in Ithaca, N.Y., John Brown's Body plays old-fashioned reggae, sometimes updated with dub-inspired electronic effects; the results are less ham-fisted than you might think, which isn't saying much. With Club D'Elf and Haale. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, boweryballroom.com, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Kelefa Sanneh) * JACK JONES (Tonight and tomorrow night) In full command of his formidable vocal technique, Mr. Jones, at 68, is arguably the most accomplished singer still standing to work in a Sinatra-descended lounge style as demanding as it is easily parodied. At 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $60 prix fixe dinner required at the early shows, $20 minimum at the late shows. (Holden) LOS LOBOS (Thursday) Los Lobos started out in Mexican music, went on to dig deeply into Americana, from blues to country to rhythm and blues to salsa, and then added some twists. Lately a new Latin percussionist has been revitalizing the band. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30. (Pareles) MEGADETH, LAMB OF GOD, OPETH, ARCH ENEMY (Thursday) The vanguard of heavy metal, past and present. Megadeth's members were steely, cynical soothsayers at a time when the dominant style was poofy hair and power ballads, and they haven't changed a bit. Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and, without any irony or sarcasm, calls its style ''pure American metal.'' Opeth, from Sweden, adds intriguing depth to the usual histrionics of black metal with gentle acoustic parts and tough, growly sounds. Arch Enemy, with former members of Carcass, Carnage and Candlemass, reaches back to the glory days of guttural death metal.

(Sisario) NEW YORK GYPSY FESTIVAL (Sunday) With a thriving rock scene in New York inspired by Gypsy and Eastern European music, a full festival that brings major Gypsy artists from overseas has been badly needed. Most of the action of this second annual series begins next Friday, but on Sunday night a preview offers two bands: Café Antarsia Ensemble, a New York four-piece that plays Greek and Balkan styles and features Ruth Margraff, a playwright and performance artist (7:30 p.m., $15); and Kal, from Serbia, which incorporates rap, Indian bhangra beats, tango and flamenco guitar (9:30 and 11:30 p.m., $22).

(Sisario) BRAD PAISLEY, CARRIE UNDERWOOD (Thursday) Knowing the value of terse composition and sly wordplay, Mr. Paisley scored one of country's biggest hits last year with ''Alcohol.'' A droll defense of grog from the drink's point of view (''I've been known to cause a few breakups/And I've been known to cause a few births''), it is one of the rare novelty songs that outlives its novelty. Ms. Underwood won the fourth season of ''American Idol'' and has sold more than three million copies of her country-pop album ''Some Hearts'' (Arista). At 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; $25 to $53. (Sisario) LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Monday) Mr. Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. With Dub Is a Weapon. At 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $42. (Pareles) RODRIGO Y GABRIELA (Tuesday) Once thrash-metal bandmates in Mexico, this guitar duo discovered what the Gipsy Kings have long known: Europeans and Americans go crazy for virtuosic acoustic renditions of their favorite 70's rock ballads. The Gipsy Kings did it with ''Hotel California,'' and Rodrigo y Gabriela's self-titled new album, on ATO Records, includes a lush ''Stairway to Heaven.'' With Natalie Walker. At 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sisario) ROLLING STONES (Wednesday) It took a fall by Keith Richards from a palm tree in Fiji -- and his subsequent brain surgery -- to slow them down, and even then it was for only a few months. The Stones continue the world tour for ''A Bigger Bang'' (Virgin), their leanest and most acclaimed album in decades. At 8 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $62 to $452. (Sisario) * REGINA SPEKTOR (Wednesday and Thursday) Rhapsodic and sweet, Ms. Spektor's fantasies veer from the childlike to the erotic, in endearingly idiosyncratic piano and vocal parts that can resemble P J Harvey, Billie Holiday or Chopin.

(Sisario) ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme song from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor.

At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Holden) SUNSET RUBDOWN (Sunday and Monday) A solo enterprise of the prolific Spencer Krug, who sings and plays keyboards in the Montreal indie-arty band Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown is one of those weirdly fascinating bedroom noise projects characterized by stompy lo-fi backing tracks and evocative stream-of-consciousness lyrics (''Shut up, I am dreaming of places where lovers have wings''). With Beaver. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) YAT-KHA (Tuesday) Led by musicians from Tuva in southern Siberia, Yat-Kha features the sound of throat singing, the simultaneous production of guttural low notes and their eerily pure overtones. But its leader, Albert Kuvezin, started out playing in rock bands, and Yat-Kha puts some rock beats behind songs about steppes, reindeer, ancient conquerors and pretty girls. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20.

MICHEL CAMILO AND TOMATITO (Monday through Wednesday) Six years ago, the Dominican pianist Michel Camilo and the Spanish flamenco guitarist known as Tomatito released an ebullient and well-received album called ''Spain'' (Verve).

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of New York City Opera's best productions, and some fine young talents should make this run of it worth hearing. Shu-Ying Li, the Mimi, has shown a really striking soprano on past occasions; James Valenti, her Rodolfo, was a promising Met Council winner in 2002; Elizabeth Caballero, the Musetta, made a very good City Opera debut last season; and Daniel Mobbs, the Marcello, has been proving himself reliably at Caramoor and elsewhere for several years. George Manahan, the company's music director, conducts. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Anne Midgette) * 'La GiocOnda' (Tuesday) Ponchielli's 1876 ''Gioconda'' can be seen as stuck on a crossroads of Italian opera history. On one level it is a grand opera in the manner of ''Aida.'' Yet in its conventional structure of arias and ensembles it harkens to days of Donizetti. It also anticipates the move toward realism, with its melodramatic story of the street singer Gioconda. The work used to be a staple of all opera houses. The Met is bringing it back for the first time in more than 15 years, with a glittering cast topped by the soprano Violeta Urmana as Gioconda and the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina as Laura. Bertrand de Billy conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini) 'Idomeneo' (Thursday) Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's solid old production of Mozart's ''Idomeneo'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera with Ben Heppner singing the title role; Kristine Jepson as Idomeneo's son Idamante; Dorothea Röschmann as Ilya; and Olga Makarina as Elettra. James Levine conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Allan Kozinn) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Monday) To open its season, the Met returns to Puccini's weepy masterpiece, with big guns firing. The new production is Anthony Minghella's. The company's music boss, James Levine, conducts. And Cristina Gallardo-Domâs, Marcello Giordani and Dwayne Croft take the principal roles. Unsurprisingly, the performance is sold out. At 6:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org. (Bernard Holland) 'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive and beloved, the sexagenarian Amato Opera proves that, in opera, tradition and devotion can prevail over quality. It's remarkable that all of Mozart's characters can fit on the theater's tiny stage. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Midgette) 'SEMELE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The New York City Opera's Handel series continues with a first-rate update evoking Marilyn Monroe, the Kennedys and the kind of sex and violence that Ovid's original gods and goddesses might have understood. Elizabeth Futral takes the title role. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Holland) * 'die tote stadt' (Sunday and Wednesday) Erich Wolfgang Korngold's renown as the composer of swashbuckling film scores for Hollywood hits of the 1930's like ''Captain Blood'' and ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' has understandably overwhelmed his early work as an early-20th-century German modernist. At least his 1920 opera ''Die Tote Stadt'' lingers at the margins of the repertory. The New York City Opera revives Frank Corsaro's production of this psychological mystery about a man obsessed with his saintly dead wife, Marie, and who is spooked when he chances upon a look-alike, a sultry temptress and actress named Marietta. Sunday at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Tommasini) Classical Music Babi Yar Commemoration (Wednesday) The Museum of Jewish Heritage will commemorate the 65th anniversary of the Jewish massacre at Babi Yar in Kiev with ''Babi Yar Remembered: Yevtushenko and Shostakovich in Word and Song.'' The program features a reading by the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, while Misha and Cipa Dichter perform the world premiere of Shostakovich's two-piano version of his Symphony No. 13, ''Babi Yar,'' with full male chorus and Valentin Peytchinov, a bass.

The momentum continues on Monday with Petr Kotik's intrepid new-music S.E.M. Ensemble, which will play works including Xenakis's ''Dikhthas'' and ''Mikka''; Stockhausen's ''Zeitmasse''; A. Vincent Raikhel's ''go to, go by''; and Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra, with Joseph Kubera as soloist. One of Mr. Kotik's own works, ''Wilsie Bridge,'' is also on the lineup.

The program will include Bach's Prelude and Fugue in A minor, Persichetti's ''Shimah B'Koli'' (Psalm 130), Mendelssohn's Sonata No. 3, Franck's ''Cantabile'' and Messiaen's Méditation V from ''Méditations sur le Mystère de la Sainte Trinité.'' At 4 p.m., 980 Park Avenue, at 84th St, (212) 288-3588, saintignatiusloyola.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. 'AUTUMN MOON CHINESE DANCE FESTIVAL' (Tonight and tomorrow) Dance China NY, the resident troupe of the New York Chinese Cultural Center, will perform works by Jiang Qi, Dai Jian, Wan Jing, Wang Zhi Qiang and others, all drawing on traditional Chinese and Western modern styles. Tonight at 7:30, tomorrow at 2 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 322-3764, tribecapac.org; $25. (Jennifer Dunning) MARIANA BEKERMAN DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) ''Taro,'' created by Mariana Bekerman and the guest choreographers Keiko Fujii and Rebekah J. Kennedy, tells the story of a woman whose world is transformed when she encounters an evil spirit. At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org/soho.html; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) CAITLIN COOK (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Cook, a musician and dancer, presents her first evening-length performance, ''Skint.'' The piece blends highly physical movement with improvised, experimental music, and projections by Calder Martin. (Through Sept. 30.) At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11; $12. (Erika Kinetz) * FALL FOR DANCE (Thursday) Only in its third year but clearly the king of New York's late summer/early fall dance samplers, Fall for Dance is offering its regular 30 companies and 6 programs, but this year expands to 10 performances, with 4 of the programs repeated. Each program, from Thursday through Oct. 8, includes five wildly diverse and often famous companies in short dances that ideally build to a satisfying whole, aside from the excellence of any individual offering. Thursday's opening program, repeated next Friday, has the Korean Yi-Jo Lim Sun Dance Company, the Dutch National Ballet, Bill T. Jones, Trisha Brown and the Pennsylvania Ballet. At 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $10. (John Rockwell) KINETIC DANCE THEATER (Tomorrow and Sunday) Joanna and Ryan Greer, who direct Kinetic, explore the sleepy dreamscapes of night in ''Sleeping Giant,'' with help from Frida Kahlo, André Breton, Robert Desnos and Joyce Mansour. At 8 p.m., TADA! Theater, 15 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $15. (Dunning) NOÉMIE LAFRANCE'S 'AGORA II' (Tomorrow, Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday) Apparently, Ms. LaFrance, a tireless artistic explorer of public space, is a glutton for punishment. Having moved bureaucratic mountains last year to stage ''Agora'' in the enormous (and empty) McCarren Park pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she now has a sequel, ''Agora II,'' which incorporates a number of guest companies and is described in the publicity materials as ''a choreographic game for 1,000 bodies.'' Good luck to them all. At 8 p.m. (arrive by 7:30), McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs and Bayard Streets, (718) 388-6309, sensproduction.org; $20 and $30. (Roslyn Sulcas) 'LUNA' (Tonight and tomorrow) Max Luna III pays tribute to Alvin Ailey, whose company Mr. Luna once danced with, in his new ''Cold Song.'' The work, influenced by Ailey's choreography and by traditional Filipino dance, is to be performed by the Yangtze Repertory Theater of America. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; a benefit performance tomorrow at 3 p.m. Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, between Park and Gold Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, yangtze-rep-theatre.org. Evening performances, $15; $12 for students and 65+. Benefit performance, $25 to $100. (Dunning) * CONSTANZA MACRAS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Born in Argentina, trained in New York and Amsterdam and based in Berlin, this choreographer has arrived with her 18-member international company, Dorky Park, in the United States premiere of ''Back to the Present,'' originally presented over four hours in 2003 in an abandoned Berlin department store. At 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $20. (Rockwell) RASTRO DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Back for the third consecutive season, Rastro will present dances by its company director, Julieta Valero. (Through Sept. 30.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning) ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Tonight and tomorrow night) In Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' six dancers will struggle through a spreading inner disturbance, to rock music by Chris Woltmann, performed live. They end up nowhere, the choreographer says, or in places of unexpected tenderness in a set that fills the performance space with small alternative spaces. At 8, Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561, rindfleischdance.com; $15. (Dunning) * SHEN WEI DANCE ARTS (Tuesday through Thursday) This Chinese-born, New York-based choreographer of visually arresting dance-art spectacles makes his Joyce Theater debut with a new piece, ''Re-,'' which evokes Tibetan spirituality, and his 2003 ''Rite of Spring,'' set to the four-hand piano version of Stravinsky's score. (Through Oct. 1.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $38. (Rockwell) TAKE DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Takehiro Ueyama, who danced with the Paul Taylor Dance Company for eight years, presents the world premiere of ''ONE,'' a collaboration with the artist Paul Hunger that is based on Gregory Colbert's ''Ashes and Snow'' photography exhibit. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7, Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, takedanceny.com. General tickets, $25; students, $20; tickets including tonight's opening reception, $35. (Kinetz) ELIZABETH WARD AND HEATHER VERGOTIS (Thursday) A semi-improvised collaboration, ''Love Cervere'' explores the myth of the love cervere, a pantherlike, sweet-breathed medieval mythological creature. With choreography by Ms. Ward, who has danced with downtown types like D D Dorvillier and Cathy Weis, and music by Ms. Vergotis, a saxophonist and composer. (Through Sept. 30.) At 8 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $15, but Queens residents pay what they wish. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The aquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends it an undeniable energy. The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art; a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns; and a continuing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Roberta Smith) Brooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection,' through Dec. 27. This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Holland Cotter) Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,' through March 5. Dia:Beacon has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Ms. Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, www.diacenter.org. (Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Ecotopia: The Second I.C.P. Triennial of Photography and Video,' through Jan. 7. Punctuated by big black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth.'' The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered, thanks to the widening scope of human indifference and exploitation. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith) * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) The Met: 'CÉzanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde,' through Jan. 7. The come-on title of this show turns out to be slightly misleading. The star is not any of the artists. It is a dealer, Ambroise Vollard, born in 1866, arrived in Paris in 1887 from the Île de la Réunion. The works in the show are eye candy, sure, but they also passed through Vollard's hands. Picasso bought a Matisse still life and a Renoir bather from Vollard. They're both here. So is Cézanne's ''Bathers,'' which Monet bought; and Cézanne's ''Battle of Love,'' which Renoir got. What's worth noting are less the landmarks than the byways: a Renoir portrait of Vollard dressed as a torero. And some Matisses, from before 1904, when Vollard organized a Matisse show, which tanked, document a genius whose imminent breakthrough Vollard missed. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) * THE MUSEUM AT F.I.T.: 'LOVE AND WAR: THE WEAPONIZED WOMAN,' through Dec. 16. From a museum known for elucidating both the erotic and architectural nature of clothing design, this characteristically handsome exhibition examines the influence of garments of love and seduction (lingerie) and of war (armor and military uniforms) on modern and contemporary couturiers. The Museum at F.I.T., Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212) 217-5800, fitnyc.edu/museum. (Smith) National Academy Museum: 'Luminist Horizons: The Art and Collection of James A. Suydam,' through Dec. 31. Mr. Suydam is remembered, if at all, as a 19th-century American Luminist painter whose reputation has all but sunk quietly into the New England salt meadows that he loved to paint. This exhibition has a few aims, one of which is a kind of art historical search and rescue operation. Mr. Suydam's early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material, pleasantly detached scenes of rural tranquillity or calm seas beneath hazy skies. His masterwork, ''Paradise Rocks, Newport'' (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam -- and his fellow Luminists -- were an extremely talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Benjamin Genocchio) NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer, through Oct 9. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman) RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Nadine Robinson: Alles Grau,' 'Quid Pro Quo: Rashawn Griffin, Karyn Olivier and Clifford Owen: 2005-06 Artists-in-Residence,' and 'Beyond Sight,' through Oct. 22. The Studio Museum in Harlem is looking sharp with three concurrent shows, the outstanding one being a single big sound-sculpture by Nadine Robinson. It expands her political purview from imperialism to Armageddon, with hundreds of speakers embedded in an 11-foot-high gray-black wall unit that generate a sampling of satanic film scores (''The Omen,'' ''The Matrix''), mixed with funeral chants and Rastafarian dance music. ''Quid Pro Quo'' is a showcase for the 2005-6 artists in residence, all interdisciplinarians with a sweet-and-sour Dadaist touch. Mr. Owens, with performance, looks intriguingly volatile. And you won't want to leave the museum without checking out ''Beyond Sight,'' the work of the 14 teenagers. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseuminharlem.org. (Cotter) Queen Sofía Spanish Institute: 'Albert Ràfols-Casamada, Paintings, 1950-2005,' through next Friday. This institute has devoted its two galleries to a half-century survey of the Spanish painter Albert Ràfols-Casamada. Blocky, indistinct shapes floating in broad expanses of watery color are the rule, for Mr. Ràfols-Casamada is a devotee of a brand of soft-edge, gesture-oriented, color-loving abstraction that was very chic in the 1950's and 60's. If there is something original about Mr. Ràfols-Casamada's work, it is his feathery layering of paint. In 1963 he started making use of collage. His ambition is nothing much greater than this: eye-pleasing pictures suffused with harmony, rhythm and balanced color relations. 84 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 628-0420, queensofiaspanishinstitute.org. (Genocchio) Galleries: Uptown * ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW, through Dec. 10. Taking its name from a 1978 hit by the punk band Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea; their mediums include painting, drawing, sculpture, video, photography and performance. Keep a special eye out for Mari Eastman's wryly beautiful paintings; Mika Tajima's glamorous deconstruction of Minimalism; and the video-performance efforts of Patty Chang, Laurel Nakadate and Xavier Cha. An added bonus: 12, or 71 percent, of the show's 17 artists are women. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Smith) ANDY WARHOL: MAO Whoever added the colors and brushwork to Andy Warhol's silkscreen images of the Chairman, now 30 years dead, seems to have been having a good time. The surfaces have more life than usual for the master of art-as-business production, even if the show lacks one of Warhol's really, really big Maos. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through Oct. 7. (Smith) Galleries: 57th Street ALEXI WORTH: COUPLES A prominent bald head, somewhere between a boxed-in apple by Magritte and the smooth pate of a de Chirico mannequin, dominates several of these quirky paintings, which are as notable for the weirdness ascribed to both representation and human relations as for the discreet formalism of space, scale, tone and surface (Smith). DC Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 247-2111, through Oct. 7. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea TOMOO GOKITA: DRUNKO A whiz at drawing, this Tokyo-based artist is making his New York solo debut with a show of his first paintings, executed in black and white gouache on canvas. The best are full of strange squiggles and doodles that suggest the elements of an Yves Tanguy Surrealist landscape swept into a messy pile, like entrails. ATM Gallery, 619 West 27th Street, (212) 375-0349, atmgallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Smith) * AXEL KASSEBÖHMER Not all German painters come from Leipzig. This New York debut and 15-year sampling introduces one whose work suggests the painting-as-paint strictures of Gerhard Richter (with whom he studied) filtered through the blunt land- and seascape abbreviations of artists like Emil Nolde and (to American eyes) Milton Avery. They convey a mystical yet flat-footed physicality, a penchant for sly references to the history of textiles and ceramics and an impressive range of causes and effects. Klemens Gasser & Tanja Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-6594, gassergrunert.net, through Oct. 14. (Smith) 'Street Poets & Visionaries: Selections from the UbuWeb Collection' Poetic is the word for the text-based work that Kenneth Goldsmith has assembled for this group show. Printed copies of shaped poems by David Daniels, a West Coast artist now in his 70's, make up about half of what's here. Most of the rest is anonymous urban ''outsider'' material picked up over the years by Mr. Goldsmith from the street and digitally archived as the UbuWeb Collection (ubu.com). Over all, the content is idiosnyncratic, to say the very least: obessional, paranoic, splenetic, militant, millenarian and just plain psychically intense in a way that art in Chelsea rarely feels. Oliver Kamm/5BE Gallery, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, 5begallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Cotter) Alison Elizabeth Taylor This artist's wood veneer inlay images dwell on the darker side of the suburban idyll. Sexual tension, waste, bigotry and violence underlie their luxurious-looking surfaces, along with a gnawing estrangement from nature: in this case, mostly the desert landscape around Las Vegas, where Ms. Taylor grew up. Couples and small groups of people embody fractured, ambiguous relationships in her carefully constructed marquetry ''paintings.'' James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com, through Sept. 30. (Genocchio) Other Galleries 'Moving Pictures: American Art and Early Film, 1880-1910' What's thought to be the first movie kiss, between May Irwin and John C. Rice, occurred in 1896, photographed by the Edison Manufacturing Company as the subject of a 19-second film shown at a New York music hall. It and dozens of other early movie treasures, along with fine art of the period, are shown in this engrossing if learned survey of the links between the earliest movies and other American visual art forms at the turn of the 20th century. A vital part of the show is the section devoted to the body in motion. It reveals how the work of Eadweard Muybridge, the English-born, California-based photographer who did studies of humans and animals in movement, played an important role in the development of motion pictures. Throughout the show, provocative juxtapositions are made of films and paintings by Thomas Eakins, Maurice Prendergast,and John Sloan, among others. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, www.nyu.edu/greyart, through Dec. 9. (Glueck) Last Chance COOPER HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu; closes on Sunday. (Johnson) * STUART HAWKINS: CUSTOMS The latest series of daffy photographs by this American artist working in Nepal rarely reflects well on Western tourists. Too stagy to be snapshots and too haphazard to be completely planned, they parlay familiar travel terms like ''Day Driver,'' ''Field Notes,'' ''Welcome Drink'' and ''Medicine Kit'' into bizarre sitcoms. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Michael Heizer Sculptures in concrete representing prehistoric hand tools, much enlarged so that they resemble Modernist sculptures by a follower of Brancusi. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 421-3292, pacewildenstein.com; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED' In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this season, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Smith) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/Out of Me' Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday. (Johnson) RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

VDrug Enforcement Agency officials searched five Bay Area sites linked to a marijuana dispensary in the San Francisco Mission District on Tuesday, seizing thousands of plants and arresting 15 people, the federal authorities said. The dispensary, known as Compassionate Caregivers, was a distributor of medical marijuana to patients with prescriptions under state law. Selling medical marijuana, however, is illegal under federal laws, which have been cited in a string of raids and arrests in the Bay Area.

VIt's fun being governor of Montana. Just watch Brian Schweitzer bouncing around the streets of Helena in the passenger seat of the state's official S.U.V., fumbling with wires, trying to stick the flashing police light on the roof. When he spots some legislators on the sidewalk, he blasts them with the siren, then summons them by name on the loudspeaker. The men jump, and the governor tumbles out of the car, doubled in laughter, giving everyone a bear hug or a high-five or a soft slap on the cheek. Schweitzer, a Democrat in his first term, marches into a barroom in blue jeans and cowboy boots and a beaded bolo tie, and his border collie, Jag, leaps out of the vehicle and follows him in. The governor throws back a few pints of the local brew and introduces himself to everyone in the place, down to the servers and a small girl stuck there with her parents. He takes time from the backslapping to poach cubes of cheese from the snack platter and sneak them to the girl, who is now chasing his dog around the bar. ''This is how you make friends with Jag,'' he advises her. ''Just hold it in your hand and let him take it.''

VMark Sundeen article on Brian Schweitzer, Montana's first Democratic governor in 16 years, and whether his election in 2004, when Democrats also took control of State Legislature, signals that Republican bastions in Western states are losing ground to new, Democratic brand of libertarian-tinged prairie populism; Schweitzer opposes gun control, supports death penalty and calls for low taxes and balanced budgets, but he also supports energy conservation and environmental regulation, opposes government restrictions on abortion and is critic of free-trade deals; whether or not Schweitzer can help build 'blue bridge' of governorships stretching from 'Alberta to Mexico' will be tested in November elections, in which he is campaigning for Jon Tester, Democrat seeking to unseat Sen Conrad Burns in Montana, and Bill Ritter, Democrat running for governor in Colorado; photo (L)

VTHE president of the Litchfield Land Trust was charged with marijuana possession late last month after marijuana plants were found growing on property owned by the trust, the Connecticut State Police said. Master Sgt. J. Paul Vance, a state police spokesman, said on Tuesday that Nathan P. Litwin, 30, the president of the trust and a lawyer in Torrington, and Joshua P. Barbero, 27, of Goshen were arrested on Sept. 28 after the state police found about 20 six-foot-tall marijuana plants in a field on the 300-acre site near Prospect Mountain Road in Litchfield. Sergeant Vance said it was about 100 pounds of marijuana.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-7 U.S. Presses for U.N. Vote On North Korea Sanctions The United States pressed for a vote on a Security Council resolution that would sanction North Korea for its claimed nuclear test, but questions from China and Russia cast the timing and possibly the content of the resolution into doubt. John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said the new problems appeared ''technical'' rather than ''substantial.'' A1 Bangladeshi Wins Peace Prize A Bangladeshi economist, Mohammad Yunus, and the Grameen Bank he founded 30 years ago, won the Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering work in giving tiny loans to millions of poor people whom no commercial bank would touch. A1 Nobelist Criticizes French Vote Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish novelist who won the Nobel Prize in Literature this week, went on television to criticize the French parliamentary vote to make it a crime to deny that the Ottoman Turks' mass killing of Armenians constituted genocide. A5 Iraqi Minister Plans Shake-Up Iraq's interior minister, Jawad al-Bolani, under pressure from Western officials and some Iraqi leaders to purge the ministry of sectarian influence, said that he was preparing to reshuffle its leadership, and that he had the political backing to carry out the plan. A5 British Officer Clarifies Remark Gen. Sir Richard Dannatt of Britain sought to clarify his remarks to a newspaper that Britain should withdraw from Iraq ''sometime soon.'' He said he meant that British troops should not remain there for ''years and years.'' A5 Swiss Cite Privacy Law Breach Swiss banks broke the nation's law by providing banking information to American counterterrorism officials, Switzerland's top data-protection official said. A7 NATIONAL A8-10; 14 More States Consider Same-Sex Marriage Laws The debate over same-sex marriage was a black-or-white proposition two years ago when voters in 11 states barred gay couples from marrying. But this year shades of gray are everywhere, as eight more states consider similar ballot measures. A1 Congressman Pleads Guilty Representative Bob Ney, the first member of Congress to confess to crimes in dealings with the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, pleaded guilty to corruption charges but said he would not immediately resign. A8 Religious Leader Aided Hamas The religious leader of a mosque in Rome, Ga., has pleaded guilty to providing financial support to the militant Palestinian organization Hamas, federal prosecutors said. A8 Page Program Leader Speaks Representative John Shimkus, who has been chairman of the Congressional page program since 2001, said that he was unaware of previous complaints about Mark Foley. A10 Marijuana Advocate Indicted A leading medical marijuana advocate who successfully appealed his federal conviction this year has been indicted on new criminal charges that include tax evasion and money laundering. A8 4 Shot Dead in Florida A man, a woman and two small children were found shot to death on a lonely stretch of highway in St. Lucie County, about 120 miles north of Miami. A8 Vermont Student Found Dead A University of Vermont student who had been missing since last weekend was found dead near a gorge about 15 miles from campus, and the police identified as a suspect a man she had borrowed a cellphone from in downtown Burlington. A14 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Son Ordered to Cede Role As Mrs. Astor's Guardian Anthony D. Marshall, the son of the socialite and philanthropist Brooke Astor, will have to pay more than $1.3 million, return valuable artwork and jewelry and abdicate his role as steward of his mother's financial and physical well-being as part of an agreement to settle a legal dispute involving one of New York's most famous fortunes. A1 Convention Bid in Doubt New York City's bid to land the 2008 Democratic National Convention is in jeopardy because Mayor Bloomberg is spread so thin with fund-raising commitments that he may not be able to raise the money from private donors needed to pay for it, an official said. B1 Early Snow Blankets Buffalo An early fall snowstorm buried Buffalo and a broad swath of western New York State, snarling traffic and leaving almost 400,000 homes without electricity. B1 Beliefs B5 SPORTSSATURDAY D1-8 Cardinals Tie Series, 1-1 The St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Mets, 9-6, in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series at Shea Stadium. The teams are now tied, 1-1, in the best-of-seven series. D1 ARTS B7-15 Bankruptcy for 'Air America' Air America Radio, the liberal talk-radio network launched two years ago in a bid to counter the influence of ideologically conservative radio personalities like Rush Limbaugh, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. B7 BUSINESS DAY C1-9 Insurance Industry Profits The insurance industry is expecting a record profit estimated at $60 billion this year after predictions of devastating hurricanes have so far come to naught. C1 Business Digest C2 EDITORIAL A12-13 Editorials: Science ignored, again; a medical-legal travesty in Libya; the politics of power; Verlyn Klinkenborg on frost time.

VA police sergeant responding to a call about gunshots at a party on the Upper East Side early yesterday fired a shot that struck a 15-year-old boy in the leg, the police said. Several questions remained unanswered last night, including whether the shooting was an accident or, if the sergeant intended to strike the teenager, what provoked him to fire.

VWithdrawn Opera To Return in Berlin The German opera company that canceled Mozart's ''Idomeneo'' last month, citing concerns that a scene featuring the severed head of the Prophet Muhammad might incite Islamic violence, said yesterday that it would bring the production back, The Associated Press reported. The four scheduled performances, at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, were canceled after the police said the scene -- an addition to the opera, which shows the severed heads of Muhammad, Jesus and Buddha as a protest against organized religion -- posed an ''incalculable risk'' to the performers and the audience. But the police reversed that opinion on Thursday, saying that it posed no ''concrete danger.'' The company said in a statement that it would ''aim for two performances this year,'' adding that the earliest it could be done was December. Museum Director Resigns W. Richard West Jr., below, resigned as director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian yesterday, effective November 2007. Mr. West, 63, a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes of Oklahoma who has been director for 17 years, said in a statement: ''Now is the time for the museum to have new leadership, as it embarks on the second phase of its journey.'' The museum opened a new building on the Mall in Washington two years ago. Snoop Dogg Arrested Snoop Dogg, below, was arrested on Thursday afternoon in Burbank, Calif., on suspicion of illegal drug and gun possession, The Associated Press reported. The rapper, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was arrested at Bob Hope Airport and posted $35,000 bail. Airport police officers said that when they searched him after stopping him at a loading zone for a vehicle code violation, they found marijuana and a gun. He is to be arraigned on Monday, the police said. Sling Shifts at the Met The tenor Salvatore Licitra performed with his arm in a sling at Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci'' on Thursday night at the Metropolitan Opera and is expected to do so at his next performance, on Monday, the Met said. Mr. Licitra, who rose to fame as a last-minute replacement for Luciano Pavarotti four years ago, tore two tendons in his left shoulder after he tripped over a black rod jutting from under a parked vehicle in Manhattan on Tuesday night, the Met said. The soprano Maria Guleghina will replace Andrea Gruber, above, in the title role of Puccini's ''Tosca'' for its first performance at the Metropolitan Opera this season, tonight at 8. Ms. Gruber, who is ill, is scheduled to sing the remaining performances, beginning Wednesday. Footnotes Dick Clark plans to appear on his annual ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'' show from Times Square this year, with Ryan Seacrest again as his co-host, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Clark, 76, missed the show two years ago because of a stroke but returned last year with brief appearances on the live broadcast. The Italian photographer Paolo Pellegrin has won the $30,000 W. Eugene Smith Grant in Humanistic Photography. The award will further his project ''Maktab 'It Is Written': A Journey Through the Lands of Islam.'' A $5,000 grant went to a New Yorker, Teru Kuwayama, to continue his photographic exploration of the Hindu Kush. The grants, sponsored by Nikon, recognize photographers who document the human condition.

VRepresentative Melissa Bean of Illinois, a Democrat, has a Republican opponent in next week's election, but he does not appear in the advertisement that skewers her. Instead, that role is being played by a fellow Democrat, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. Judging by some of the political name-calling in the final days before the elections, Ms. Pelosi seems to be in the thick of campaigns for Congress from Illinois to Georgia and several places in between. She is the unwitting star of at least a half-dozen television spots -- and countless radio spots, direct-mail campaigns and candidate debates --warning voters that if they choose their local Democrat for Congress, they are also casting a vote for Ms. Pelosi.

VA blue streak sweeps through the region, and a victory in a hotly contested Senate race takes center stage, announcing a new breed of Democrat. Alaska Sarah Palin, a Republican and former mayor of an Anchorage suburb, became Alaska's first female governor, fighting off a comeback bid by Tony Knowles, a Democrat and former governor. Ms. Palin, a social and fiscal conservative who calls herself a ''hockey mom,'' rose to prominence by uncovering misconduct in the administration of Gov. Frank Murkowski, whom she later trounced in the Republican primary in August.

VTwo Queens teenagers were charged with murder yesterday in the death of a 55-year-old Howard Beach man who was found gagged, bound and bludgeoned in his basement, the police said. The man, John Canora, had hired the teenagers, Alex Brown and Billy Ray Stanton, both 17 and both of Jamaica, to help with maintenance on his home on 96th Street, the police said. Mr. Brown and Mr. Stanton told the police that on the night of his death, Mr. Canora offered them marijuana and made sexual advances, the police said. Taking offense, the teenagers said, they choked Mr. Canora, beat him with a fire extinguisher and a bat, then dumped him into a sump hole and placed a bureau in front of the hole to hide the body, the police said. They stole a van and a 2002 Hyundai belonging to Mr. Canora, the police said, and are also charged with robbery and burglary. Mr. Canora\u2019s body was found on Saturday after a cousin reported him missing, the police said.

VA former sheriff pleaded not guilty in Roanoke to federal charges that he took part with 12 former and current officers in a scheme to sell drugs seized from criminals. The former sheriff, H. Franklin Cassell, was arraigned in Federal District Court along with two Henry County sheriff\u2019s deputies and a captain, all of whom pleaded not guilty in the racketeering conspiracy. Since 1998, prosecutors said, cocaine, steroids, marijuana and other drugs seized by the sheriff\u2019s department have been resold to the public. Mr. Cassell, 68, is charged with impeding federal agents\u2019 investigation and money laundering.

VRights Groups Win a Say in Madonna Adoption A Malawian judge ruled yesterday that Madonna's fitness to adopt a boy from that African nation would be decided in part by a group of human rights and child advocacy organizations, The Associated Press reported. Judge Andrew Nyirenda ruled in favor of a coalition of Malawian groups that want to participate in the assessment of the 48-year-old pop star's fitness as a mother. On Oct. 12, Judge Nyirenda granted Madonna and her husband, the filmmaker Guy Ritchie, an interim order allowing them to take initial custody of 14-month-old David Banda. But Malawi regulations stipulate that prospective parents undergo an 18-to 24-month assessment in that country. The rights groups, claiming they were concerned the government had cut legal corners to fast-track the adoption, said regulations must be followed to protect children. Alan Chinula, a lawyer for Madonna, said he had no objections to the ruling, which is unlikely to require Madonna to return to Malawi any time soon. Another Rap For Snoop Dogg After taping a performance Tuesday on ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' the rapper Snoop Dogg, below, was arrested on gun and drug charges as he left NBC Studios, The Associated Press reported. Snoop Dogg, 35, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was arrested around 6 p.m. on charges of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, possessing cocaine, transporting marijuana and having a false compartment in his vehicle. Two members of his entourage, also arrested, are acknowledged gang members, the police said. ''As of this point, he stands innocent of all charges,'' said Snoop Dogg's lawyer, Donald Etra. Mr. Etra said that his client was released on bail of $60,000 shortly after 1 a.m. on Wednesday. The arrest follows a series of other police incidents involving Snoop Dogg in recent months, including an Oct. 26 arrest at the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, Calif., after airport police said they found a gun and marijuana in his car, and a Sept. 27 arrest for carrying a deadly weapon -- a collapsible baton -- at John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana, Calif. Snoop Dogg was convicted in 1990 of cocaine possession and was charged with gun possession after a 1993 traffic stop. He was acquitted of murder in 1996 after the death of an alleged street gang member killed by gunfire from the vehicle in which Snoop Dogg was traveling.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-22 Bush Rejects Quick Exit; Iraqi Premier Offers Hope President Bush rejected the idea of a quick troop withdrawal from Iraq, even as Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq said his country's forces would be ready to take over substantial security responsibility by next June. A1 For many Iraqis, the summit meeting in Jordan between Mr. Maliki and President Bush promised little and delivered less, and reaffirmed a widespread loss of faith in the elected government's ability to turn things around. A18 Child Sex Abuse in Africa Even as sub-Saharan Africa races to adopt many of the developed world's norms for children, child sexual abuse remains a stubbornly persistent problem. In much of the continent, child advocates say, perpetrators are shielded by the traditionally low status of girls and a lingering view that sexual abuse should be dealt with privately. A1 Lower Cost of AIDS Drugs With the financial backing of a group of nations led by France, former President Bill Clinton announced that his foundation had negotiated deeply reduced prices for 19 AIDS drugs to treat children in 62 developing countries. The initiative halved the cost of the simplest-to-use therapy to less than $60 a year for each child. A9 Radiation at London Sites In the latest turn in the mystery surrounding Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian spy who died of radiation poisoning in London last week, the British government said that radiation had been detected in 12 locations around the city. A14 Pessimism on Palestinian Unity Talks to form a Palestinian unity government are at a dead end, said the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, ensuring that the Bush administration's plan to push hard toward a Middle East peace initiative will stay in the deep freeze for now. A21 NATIONAL A24-29 Pushing Responsibility In Medicaid Patients West Virginia plans to reward ''responsible'' Medicaid patients with significant extra benefits or -- as critics describe it-- to punish poor people who do not join weight-loss or antismoking programs. A1 McCain Speaks to Governors Senator John McCain of Arizona turned up at the annual meeting of the Republican Governors Association, a group headed by McCain's chief rival for their party's 2008 presidential nomination, Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts governor. A28 Revising the Citizenship Test The federal government rolled out a new citizenship test to replace an exam that critics say has encouraged prospective Americans simply to memorize facts, rather than fully understand the principles of a democracy. A26 Aid Letters for Storm Victims Louisiana has sent letters to more than 10,000 families stating how much money they can receive to rebuild their homes under the $7.5 billion housing program Congress financed this year, state officials announced. A24 Presidential Campaign Begins Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa formally opened his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, billing himself as the not-from-Washington candidate who would strive to renew a forgotten sense of community across America and offer common-sense judgment in foreign policy. A28 Civil Defense Logo's End The stark insignia of civil defense -- a C and D forming a red circle in a white triangle on a blue disk -- died after a long eclipse. Its demise was announced by the National Emergency Management Association, the group that represents state emergency managers. A24 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Working-Class Housing In Brooklyn Is to Be Sold Starrett City, a 140-acre apartment complex built 30 years ago in Brooklyn as an enclave for working-class New Yorkers, is on the auction block, its owners confirmed. Real estate executives expect the bidding for the complex to exceed $1 billion. A1 Spitzer Limits Contributions Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer, moving swiftly in his efforts to change the culture of Albany, said he would unilaterally stop accepting campaign contributions greater than $10,000 in individual donations. B1 Four Arrested in Queens Case Detectives investigating the fatal police shooting of Sean Bell, an unarmed black man, arrested four people at a Queens apartment building and seized a loaded semiautomatic handgun and a bag of marijuana, the police said. B1 Neediest Cases B5 BUSINESS DAY C1-10 Profiting From Prostate Cancer Among several widely used treatments for prostate cancer, one stands out for its profit potential. The approach, a type of radiation therapy known as intensity modulated radiation therapy, can mean reimbursement for doctors of $47,000 or more a patient. A1 Insider Trading Regulation Charles E. Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has asked NASD, which oversees the securities industry, to detail how it identifies insider trading.

VTomma Abts Is Awarded Annual Turner Prize Tomma Abts, right, beat three other finalists yesterday to win the annual Turner Prize, announced at Tate Britain in London. The $50,000 award honors a British artist under 50 for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of work in the 12 months preceding May. Ms. Abts, whose densely worked canvases are characterized by gradual layering that reveals the process of their creation, was short-listed for solo exhibitions in Switzerland and London. (Far right, Ms. Abts's 2005 painting ''Mehm.'') The jury expressed admiration for the ''rigor and consistency'' of her paintings, ''in which compelling images reveal their complexity slowly over time.'' The other finalists -- Phil Collins, Mark Titchner and Rebecca Warren -- received $10,000 each from the pool of prize money, sponsored by the makers of Gordon's gin. The Turner Prize ceremonies will be held next year at Tate Liverpool as a prelude to Liverpool's year of celebrations as European Capital of Culture in 2008. New Paris Opera Director Nicolas Joël has been chosen to become the director of the Paris Opera, succeeding Gérard Mortier, who will reach 65, the mandatory retirement age, in 2008, Agence France-Presse reported. In the past 16 years Mr. Joël, 53, below, has won acclaim as artistic director of the Capitole Theater of Toulouse in southwest France and for directing at leading houses on the Continent, as well as at the Metropolitan Opera. He was named to a six-year term starting in September 2009. The announcement of his selection by Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres put an end to months of speculation and rumor about a successor to Mr. Mortier. In the meantime Mr. Joël will be named deputy director. With an annual budget of $210 million and a staff of 1,600, the Paris Opera runs the Bastille Opera and the ornate Palais Garnier. No Jail for Pete Doherty Pete Doherty, the trouble-prone British rocker who fronts Babyshambles, was spared jail yesterday but was fined $1,525, ordered to pay court costs and barred for driving for four months when he was sentenced on an assortment of drug violations, The Associated Press reported. ''I feel relieved,'' he told reporters outside Thames Magistrates' Court in London, where he hugged fans. Mr. Doherty, 27, above, who pleaded guilty in August to charges of possession of drugs, including crack cocaine, heroin and marijuana, was told in September by Judge Jane McIvor that he would not be jailed if he continued rehabilitation, remained employed and did not commit any other offenses. In court yesterday, she said, ''Hitting your pocket is the way of punishing you in this case.'' His lawyer, Sean Curran, said there had been a ''breakdown'' in Mr. Doherty's rehabilitation but gave no details. He said he hoped his client would continue to try to end his drug habit. Free Admission Boosts Visits to British Museums On the fifth anniversary of free admission to Britain's museums and galleries, the government has released figures showing an average 83 percent increase in visits to those places that previously charged, The Guardian of London reported. Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, said the increase translated into 30 million extra visits. ''These are inspirational figures,'' she said. ''There is a real appetite for serious culture in this country; when the obstacle of entry fees is swept away, people come in their millions, and keep coming.'' But Paul Holmes, the arts spokesman for the Liberal Democrats party, warned that admission fees might return if the government cuts support for museums and galleries next year. Footnotes After a year on Broadway, ''The Color Purple'' has announced that it has recouped its entire $11 million investment. The first North American tour of the musical begins on April 17 at the Cadillac Palace Theater in Chicago. ''Essentially Woody,'' a 28-film retrospective of the four-decade career of Woody Allen, will run at Film Forum from Dec. 22 through Jan. 11. The festival will begin with two days of ''Annie Hall,'' the 1977 romance co-starring Mr. Allen and Diane Keaton that went on to win Academy Awards for best picture, best actress, best director and best screenplay. Alan Arkin will be saluted by the Film Society of Lincoln Center on Dec. 19 at the Walter Reade Theater, where clips from his long acting career will be shown, and a screening of the comedy ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' in which he appears, will follow a conversation with Kent Jones, associate director of programming at the society. Chita Rivera, above, will begin a national tour of her autobiographical musical, ''Chita Rivera: The Dancer's Life,'' with performances at the Aronoff Theater in Cincinnati from Dec. 19 through 31. Among other locations on the 15-city itinerary are Miami, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Seattle, Washington and Boston.

VParis Museums Go Hollywood The Louvre and the Musée d'Orsay, two of the most popular museums in Paris, are going into the movie business. In separate ventures in the next two years, they will underwrite films by seven filmmakers to be shot, at least in part, inside their walls, Reuters reported. Among the directors are Jim Jarmusch of the United States and Tsai Ming-liang of Taiwan, winner of a Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 1996 for ''The River.'' ''Traditional financing in France is drying up for these talented auteurs,'' said Catherine Derosier-Pouchous, who heads the Louvre's audiovisual program. ''We want to support their work. We're selecting three filmmakers who will rethink the meaning of cinema in the 21st century.'' As part of its 20th anniversary, the Musée d'Orsay will work with four filmmakers, among them Mr. Jarmusch, Olivier Assayas of France and Hou Hsiao-hsien of Taiwan. All four films, budgeted at about $3 million each, will star Juliette Binoche, above. One of the Louvre's films, ''Faces,'' directed by Mr. Tsai, will star Jean-Pierre Léaud, who made his debut as the hero of the 1959 François Truffaut film ''The 400 Blows.'' Students Lose 'Borat' Suit Two South Carolina college students irked by their depiction in the ''Borat'' movie have lost their petition for a court order to delete a scene they regard as injurious to their reputations, Reuters reported. The students, fraternity brothers shown guzzling alcohol and making racist remarks, sued the distributor and producers in Los Angeles last month, arguing that the filmmakers had duped them into appearing in the movie and falsely promised that it would never be shown in the United States. At the time their request for a temporary restraining order to remove the offending scene was denied. But the students, identified in court papers only as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2, were given another chance to seek an injunction last week, when arguments focused mainly on the anticipated DVD release of ''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,'' starring Sacha Baron Cohen as a fictional and boorish Kazakh television journalist. Judge Joseph Biderman of Los Angeles Superior Court ruled against them. Their lawyer, Olivier Taillieu, said last week that the film had cost one of the students a job at a major corporation and another a prestigious internship. A third student involved in the scene did not participate in the suit. Princes Plan Pop Concert To Honor Diana Princes William, above right, and Harry, left, of Britain said yesterday that they were planning a huge pop concert, featuring Elton John, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The ''Concert for Diana,'' a charity event, is to take place in London at the new Wembley Stadium on July 1, which would have been her 46th birthday, Agence France-Press reported. William, 24, and Harry, 22, also said a memorial service would be held in London on Aug. 31, exactly 10 years after Diana's death in a car crash in Paris. Top acts, many reflecting Diana's tastes, are to be chosen by her sons for the concert, expected to attract a live audience of 90,000 and to be televised around the world. Besides Elton John, performers will include Diana's favorite band, Duran Duran; the singers Bryan Ferry and Joss Stone; the American rapper Pharrell Williams; and the English National Ballet. Andrew Lloyd Webber will present a medley of songs from his shows. ''It's to remember her and to commemorate her life and celebrate it,'' William said of Diana. ''We want to represent exactly what our mother would have wanted, how she was. We wanted to have this big concert, full of energy, full of the sort of fun and happiness which I know she would have wanted. And on her birthday as well, it's got to be the best birthday present she ever had.'' Nicole Richie Arrested Nicole Richie, a star of the television show ''The Simple Life,'' was charged early on Monday with driving under the influence of drugs after she was seen blocking the carpool lane on the Ventura Freeway in Burbank, Calif., Reuters reported. The police said the arrest, at about 1:45 a.m., was made after reports from motorists of a driver going the wrong way on the busy highway. Officer Todd Workman, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol, said that Ms. Richie, 25, right, who was alone in her black sport utility vehicle when the police approached, was arrested after she failed a field sobriety test and that she admitted taking the prescription painkiller Vicodin and smoking marijuana. She was booked and released after posting $15,000 bail. Courtney Love Thanks a Judge Courtney Love, below, sobbed with joy and thanked a judge on Monday in Los Angeles after he ended her probation and dismissed three misdemeanor cases against her (two drug-related charges and one for assault and battery), The Associated Press reported. Ms. Love, 42, the former frontwoman for the rock band Hole and the widow of the Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain, told Judge Rand Rubin of Los Angeles Superior Court: ''Thank you for not taking me into custody. Thank you for giving me an opportunity. You've been a good, fair judge. Sorry for crying.'' The judge said, ''You've shown to me you are interested in a much less destructive lifestyle.'' Footnote The United States Senate has voted unanimously to reappoint Dana Gioia to a four-year term as chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts.

VIn my latest post I inquired what I could write that would most benefit the readers, serve the public interest, and what it was that you really wanted to read about. Through the modern miracle of blog commenting, the call was answered. As it is my privilege and responsibility as a journalist (of sorts) to quench your thirsts, here are a few illustrations - in both words and pictures - of the culture and climate of Afghanistan, rather than the incessant rantings of a blogger.

VJan Jarvis is 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 230 pounds. At first, he seems sullen and imposing, especially dressed in a dark-blue security guard uniform. But coaxing a smile out of Mr. Jarvis is not difficult, a remarkable achievement after a life of sexual abuse, unfocused rage and homelessness. With counseling and several hospitalizations for clinical depression, he has turned his life around.

VDeputies in Houston found 502 bales of marijuana worth an estimated $25 million in a warehouse where they arrested a truck driver after finding drugs in his tractor-trailer, the authorities said. The marijuana was recovered Wednesday by Harris County sheriff&#8217;s deputies. The truck driver, Louis Mendez, left, 29, was charged with possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to sell, Sgt. Dana Wolfe said. The authorities must still determine the exact weight of the marijuana, but they estimate it to be 15,000 to 20,000 pounds. Ten pounds of marijuana has a street value of about $16,000, Sergeant Wolfe said. Mr. Mendez was being held at the Harris County Jail on $1 million bond for the trafficking charge.

VA Nassau County correction officer was arraigned in First District Court on charges that he tried to smuggle marijuana into the county jail stashed inside cannoli on Dec. 24. The officer, Rocco Bove, 24, of Westbury, was arrested on Wednesday. The box of pastry was dropped off for an inmate, but when officers checked the contents, they discovered marijuana, rolling paper and matches, said Lt. Kevin Smith of the Nassau County police. Lieutenant Smith said the marijuana was packed inside plastic bags that were inserted into the cannoli. Mr. Bove pleaded not guilty to promoting prison contraband and unlawful possession of marijuana.

VA Far Rockaway man was charged with raping two young women at Queens motels after taking them there on the pretense of being a police officer, prosecutors said. The man, Eric McCoy, 37, stopped a 27-year-old woman on Dec. 4, planted a packet of what appeared to be marijuana in her bag and threatened to arrest her if she did not accompany him, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Then, on Tuesday, he stopped a 17-year-old, told her that he was an investigator and said she needed to accompany him for questioning, Mr. Brown said. Mr. Brown said that Mr. McCoy forced the women to have sex with him under threat of being arrested. He was held pending arraignment on charges of rape, criminal impersonation and other offenses.

VGOLF SINGH SHARES LEAD AT MERCEDES -- Vijay Singh powered his way into a five-way tie for the lead after the first round of the Mercedes-Benz Championship in Kapalua, Hawaii, yesterday, shooting a four-under-par 69. He was joined atop the leader board by K. J. Choi, Brett Wetterich, Stephen Ames and Will MacKenzie. Only 12 players in the 34-man field shot below par in extremely windy conditions. (AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE) BASEBALL FOULKE AND INDIANS FINISH DEAL -- The free-agent reliever Keith Foulke completed a one-year, $5 million contract with the Cleveland Indians yesterday. Foulke's deal includes about $2 million in potential performance bonuses and a mutual option for 2008. Bothered by assorted injuries the past two seasons in Boston, Foulke, 34, lost his closer's job last year to the rookie Jonathan Papelbon. Foulke went 3-1 with a 4.35 earned run average and no saves in 44 games. HILLENBRAND SAYS JAYS OVERREACTED -- Shea Hillenbrand made it clear yesterday that he has not forgotten his well-publicized split with the Blue Jays last July. Hillenbrand, speaking on a conference call from his home in Arizona, said he had permission to leave the Blue Jays during the season to pursue an adoption of his daughter, but was told to return before the final papers were signed. ''I could not leave early,'' said Hillenbrand who signed with the Angels last week. ''I had to sign some papers to make my adoption legal.'' Hillenbrand said he was admonished by Manager John Gibbons in front of his teammates when he returned, and was eventually traded to the San Francisco Giants. ''The Toronto Blue Jays blew it out of proportion, the manager blew it out of proportion to make me look bad,'' Hillenbrand said. LORETTA SIGNS WITH ASTROS -- Infielder Mark Loretta and the Astros agreed yesterday to a one-year, $2.5 million contract. The deal includes $1 million in performance bonuses. TRACK AND FIELD MILLROSE GAMES SELECT MILERS -- Bernard Lagat, a Kenyan-born American, and Craig Mottram of Australia were named yesterday to run in the Wanamaker Mile at the 100th annual Millrose Games on Feb. 2 at Madison Square Garden. Lagat has won the race four times. Last year, he won in 3 minutes 56.85 seconds, an impressive time on the short, tight and worn Garden track. He has won two Olympic medals at 1,500 meters. In 2005, Mottram finished third in the world championships at 5,000 meters. Millrose officials also announced the entry of Reese Hoffa, who has won the men's shot-put the past two years. Last year, he reached 71 feet 1/2 inch and was the meet's outstanding performer. (NYT) TV SPORTS LAMPLEY DENIES ABUSE ALLEGATIONS -- The sports announcer Jim Lampley denied wrongdoing yesterday after being arrested for investigation of felony domestic violence. Lampley, 57, was taken into custody Wednesday and booked on the felony charge and investigation of violating a restraining order and dissuading a witness, both misdemeanors, according to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department's domestic violence unit. He posted $35,500 bail. According to court records, Candice Sanders, 28, wrote in an application for a restraining order that Lampley attacked her in her Encinitas, Calif., apartment Dec. 31. She also alleged that he had been drinking and smoking marijuana before attacking her and claimed he threw her to the floor at a New York restaurant two months ago.

VWilliam Boyd Novel Honored William Boyd's ''Restless'' has won the new Costa prize for novels, previously known as the Whitbread Novel Award. Mr. Boyd, who won the Whitbread First Novel Award for ''A Good Man in Africa'' (1981), will receive £5,000 (about $9,700) and become eligible, with winners in four other categories, for the 2006 Costa Book of the Year prize, to be announced in London on Feb. 7. The awards honor books of the last year by writers based in Britain and Ireland. ''Restless,'' published in the United States by Bloomsbury, tells of an aging British woman who reveals to her daughter that she was a counterintelligence operative. No Burial Yet For James Brown James Brown, who died at 73 on Christmas Day, remains unburied while lawyers and his children seek to settle issues pertaining to his estate, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Brown, the ''Godfather of Soul,'' lies in a sealed coffin in a temperature-controlled, guarded room in his home on Beech Island, S.C., said Charles Reid, manager of the C. A. Reid Funeral Home in Augusta, Ga., which handled the services. Buddy Dallas, a lawyer for the singer's estate, said on Tuesday that Mr. Brown's children and the trustees under his will, which had not been filed, would determine the burial site. Bonnaroo Site Bought Organizers of the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival announced yesterday that they had bought a major portion of the farm site outside Nashville where the popular annual rock-and-country-and-anything-else event is held. The 530-acre purchase includes all of the performance areas and much of the camping and parking area, they said. The festival will continue to lease an additional 250 acres used for parking and camping. Besides becoming the permanent home of the Bonnaroo festival, to be held this year from June 14 to 17, the site will be used for various other events. Celebrities Plead Not Guilty A lawyer for George Michael, 43, the former Wham! frontman, denied yesterday in a London court that his client was unfit to drive and in possession of marijuana after being found slumped over the wheel of his car in October, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Michael, above left, was not present. A court official said that the case would resume on March 7 and that a trial date had been set for April 23. In a Los Angeles court, a lawyer for Paris Hilton, 25, entered a plea of not guilty on Tuesday, four months after she was charged with driving under the influence. The police said she had been driving ''erratically'' through Hollywood. Ms. Hilton, above right, a star of the television series ''The Simple Life,'' was not in court. A pretrial hearing was scheduled for Jan. 23. Footnotes The Hollywood Foreign Press Association and the Internal Revenue Service announced yesterday that they had reached agreement on tax liabilities related to the gift boxes distributed by the association to presenters at its Golden Globes Awards. Under the agreement, the association settled obligations with respect to boxes given through 2005. Recipients of 2006 boxes will be given tax forms and will be responsible for their taxes. No boxes will be given this year. Richard Gere, who played a man whose heart was won by a prostitute in the 1990 film ''Pretty Woman,'' cheered some 10,000 Indian prostitutes as they danced to raunchy Bollywood songs yesterday at a Mumbai fairground, where he urged them to refuse sex without condoms to prevent the spread of H.I.V./AIDS, Reuters reported. ''No condom, no sex,'' he yelled into a microphone. ''No condom, no sex.''

VA state legislator turned in an application to the State Agriculture Department to become the nation&#8217;s first licensed industrial hemp farmer. Agriculture Commissioner Roger Johnson said the legislator, David Monson, a Republican representative, provided fingerprints with his application, which will be used for a background check. Last month, the State Agriculture Department finished its work on rules that farmers may use to grow industrial hemp, a cousin of marijuana that does not have hallucinogenic properties. The plant is used to make products including paper and rope. Some law enforcement officials fear that industrial hemp may shield illicit marijuana, but supporters of hemp say the concern is unfounded.

VWith a month to go before pitchers and catchers report to camp, the Mets' off-season priority of landing a top-flight starting pitcher remains unfulfilled. Instead, General Manager Omar Minaya indicated yesterday that the Mets would divide eight into three and hope that a group consisting of John Maine, Oliver Pérez, Mike Pelfrey, Philip Humber, Alay Soler, Dave Williams, Jorge Sosa and Jason Vargas will fill the Nos. 3, 4 and 5 spots in the rotation. Minaya was straightforward about the team's pitching strategy during a conference call in which the Mets announced their two latest free-agent signings -- Sosa and the left-handed reliever Scott Schoeneweis.

VMike Tomlin, the Minnesota Vikings' defensive coordinator, was hired by the Pittsburgh Steelers as their third head coach in 38 years, following Chuck Noll (23 seasons) and Bill Cowher (15 seasons), who left after the regular season to spend more time with his family. Tomlin, who is black, accepted the job Sunday night, just as Lovie Smith of the Chicago Bears and Tony Dungy of the Indianapolis Colts became the first black coaches to take teams to the Super Bowl.

VThe Police Department announced yesterday that it had dismantled two drug organizations that were selling crack cocaine and marijuana in Washington Heights. One group was operating out of eight apartments in the Polo Grounds Houses, on Eighth Avenue near 155th Street, the police said. The other group, a subset of the Bloods street gang known as the Best Out, was earning about $10,000 a week from street-level sales in the same area, the police said. Officers began investigating the two groups last year, the police said. In raids yesterday, the police arrested more than two dozen people and seized cash, narcotics and two .22-caliber revolvers.

VThe Police Department announced yesterday that it had dismantled two drug organizations that were selling crack cocaine and marijuana in Washington Heights. One group was operating out of eight apartments in the Polo Grounds Houses, on Eighth Avenue near 155th Street, the police said. The other group, a subset of the Bloods street gang known as the Best Out, was earning about $10,000 a week from street-level sales in the same area, the police said. Officers began investigating the two groups last year, the police said. In raids yesterday, the police arrested more than two dozen people and seized cash, narcotics and two .22-caliber revolvers.

VSelective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition. Theater Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater. Previews and Openings 'ADRIFT IN MACAO' In previews; opens on Feb 13. Primary Stages presents Christopher Durang and Peter Melnick's new musical sendup of the sexy, shadowy world of film noir (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: SALVAGE' In previews; opens on Feb. 18. Tom Stoppard's epic trilogy about 19th-century Russian intelligentsia comes to an end with this final installment, which once again stars a vigorous and immense cast, including Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke. Jack O'Brien directs (2:30). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. 'HOWARD KATZ' Previews start today. Opens on March 2. Roundabout Theater presents a new play by Patrick Marber (''Closer'') about a down-on-his-luck talent agent. Doug Hughes directs. (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. 'IN THE HEIGHTS' In previews; opens on Thursday. A new Off Broadway musical about two days in the life of Washington Heights, presented from the vantage point of a corner bodega (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. 'JOURNEY'S END' Previews start on Thursday. Opens on Feb. 22. This English transfer of R. C. Sherriff's early-20th-century antiwar play stars the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Jefferson Mays (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'THE LAST WORD ' In previews; opens on Thursday. This new play by Oren Safdie (''Private Jokes, Public Places'') is about a retired ad executive who wants to be a playwright. Daniel J. Travanti (''Hill Street Blues'') stars (1:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'THE MADRAS HOUSE' In previews; opens on Feb. 15. Yet another modern-sounding play by Harley Granville Barker (''Waste'') comes out of the woodwork: a 1909 drama about business battles, family values and sex (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. 'MARY ROSE' In previews; opens on Feb. 20. Although it can sometimes seem otherwise, J. M. Barrie wrote stories besides ''Peter Pan,'' including this one about a girl who might be a ghost. Tina Landau directs (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' In previews; opens on Sunday. F. Murray Abraham plays Shylock in this Theater for a New Audience production. Darko Tresnjak directs (2:20). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. 'A VERY COMMON PROCEDURE' In previews; opens on Feb. 14. Michael Greif (''Rent'') directs MCC Theater's new play about a married woman who has an affair with a doctor (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. Broadway 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in rural Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DUTCHMAN' A revival of the poet Amiri Baraka's screed on race and American values, 43 years after its Greenwich Village debut, aims for all the fire and might of a Malcolm X speech but none of the rhetorical elegance. It shouts so loudly that you can't hear a thing (1:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL' Five vignettes about finding love and keeping it as immature in attitude as they are thin in substance. The filmmaker Anthony Minghella, whose offering here is a short play called ''Hang Up,'' provides the silliest (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Bellafante) 'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE FEVER' Wallace Shawn performs his provocative monologue about a guilt-riddled bourgeois everyman sweating his way through a moral crisis. The rich, often hypnotic writing draws us into his tortured mindscape, as he shifts between shame over his sense of entitlement and reasoned arguments that sacrifice is unnecessary and pointless. Meanwhile, in the third world, the violence and poverty continue unabated (1:30). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'FRANK'S HOME' Peter Weller plays Frank Lloyd Wright in Richard Nelson's dreary bio-drama, which lingers lovingly on its subject's feet of clay while paying arid lip service to his genius (1:45). Playwrights Horizons Mainstage, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 719-4200. (Isherwood) 'THE GREAT DIVORCE' The Magis Theater Company makes a creditable effort to explore spiritual matters in this adaptation of C. S. Lewis's story about a bus trip through the afterlife. In well-acted vignettes, characters are led to examine their lives and ruling loves. It's often intriguing, and rarely preachy (1:30). Salvation Army Theater, 315 West 47th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO GREAT SOCIETY' The brainy experimentalists of Elevator Repair Service provide a madcap and almost dreamlike re-enactment of a 1968 episode of William F. Buckley's ''Firing Line,'' which features Mr. Buckley squaring off with Jack Kerouac (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'THE SCENE' Theresa Rebeck's latest is a sharp-witted, sharp-elbowed comedy about the savage economies of sex and show business in Manhattan. Tony Shalhoub plays an out-of-work actor, Charlie, happily married -- but not really -- to Patricia Heaton's frazzled chat show booker. Enter the femme fatale Clea, played by the gifted Anna Camp, and goodbye, Charlie (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood) * 'TOYS IN THE ATTIC' Austin Pendleton's fine revival of Lillian Hellman's last play faithfully attacks the corrosive attachments of family. What good is a family, and thus a society, the play implicitly asks, that can only look in the mirror? (2:30) Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'VICTORIA MARTIN: MATH TEAM QUEEN' Must all stage teenagers speak in that exaggerated surfer-dude style in which ''awesome'' and ''totally'' make up about 50 percent of any conversation? Yes, apparently they must, from the evidence presented in this thin comedy, which is about a high school girl who finds herself on the all-male math team. The playwright, Kathryn Walat, seems to have been trying to grab the coattails of a certain spelling-bee-related show. She missed (2:00). The Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, , 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'AS YET THOU ART YOUNG AND RASH' An abstract collage of shards of feeling built out of Euripides' ''Suppliant Women,'' this meditation on grief and the death of children in senseless war offers plenty of parallels to current society without doing anything so obvious as explicitly referring to them. The five-member cast, led by three beautiful middle-aged women, is strong; the director, David Herskovits, has helped them shape an evocative piece that might be too nonliteral for some tastes, but is both moving and distinctive (1:10). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Anne Midgette) * 'THE DIRTY TALK' Kevin Cristaldi and Sidney Williams are just great in this two-hander by Michael Puzzo about strangers stranded in a hunting cabin. How they came to be there is hilariously doled out by Mr. Puzzo, along with some thoughts about identity, the Internet and the liar in all of us. Padraic Lillis, the director, has the two actors in perfect sync (1:20). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'MUST DON'T WHIP 'UM' The performance artist Cynthia Hopkins nimbly plays both a bygone '70s rock singer and the daughter she left behind on her aimless spiritual quest. Ms. Hopkins's distinctive singing voice, accompanied by her lively band Gloria Deluxe, makes the pleasures of the evening all the better (1:20). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'THE WOMEN OF TRACHIS' In Kate Ryan's wonderfully perceptive adaptation, Sophocles' rarely produced tragedy about the death of the hero Heracles and his wife, Deianira, has terrific contemporary traction. Alice Reagan's superbly cast and infectiously energetic production is fun, intelligent and eminently worth seeing. (1:00). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Jonathan Kalb) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ALPHA DOG' (R, 117 minutes) Based on a true Southern California crime, Nick Cassavetes's entertaining exploitation flick features a lot of attractive, talented young actors shimmying across the screen while embodying the collective parental nightmare. Do you know where your children are? Well, in this film they're getting busy, chilling out, smoking blunts and chugging coolers faster than a toothless wino. Oh, and committing murder. (Manohla Dargis) 'ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES' (PG, 94 minutes) Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy (Freddie Highmore) who shrinks to microscopic size to find some gems and his missing grandfather. Lots of famous names (Madonna, Robert De Niro, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg) lend their voices to the computerized part of the movie, but only briefly near the end does everything click. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn misery into entertainment. (Dargis) 'BREAKING AND ENTERING' (R, 119 minutes) This high-toned, feel-bad exercise in liberal guilt comes from Anthony Minghella, who brings the same earnest humorlessness to present-day London that he has brought to the historical past. Jude Law is an architect; Juliette Binoche is a Bosnian seamstress; and Vera Farmiga provides a glimmer of wit and liveliness as a Russian prostitute who shows up to drink coffee, show her underwear and discuss the themes of the movie. (Scott) 'CATCH AND RELEASE' (PG-13, 124 minutes ) Jennifer Garner is a young woman in Boulder, Colo., coping with the sudden death of her fiancé, who she discovers had another, secret life. Although there are signs that the first-time director Susannah Grant (screenwriter of ''Erin Brockovich'') was reaching for something more layered than a formulaic ''chick flick,'' the story never achieves basic credibility. At least its affection for its characters doesn't seem cynical. (Stephen Holden) * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'EPIC MOVIE' (PG-13, 86 minutes) A cheap, dumb parody of expensive, dumb movies. (Scott) * 'GOD GREW TIRED OF US' (PG, 90 minutes) This sober, uplifting documentary, which won two major awards at last year's Sundance Film Festival, follows the resettlement in the United States of three Sudanese young men uprooted as children by the civil war. Handsomely photographed, and inspirational but not cloyingly so, it is the rare contemporary documentary that doesn't leave a residue of cynicism and outrage. (Holden) 'THE ITALIAN' (PG-13, 99 minutes, in Russian) This dark fairy tale from Russia pulls you into a richly atmospheric, persuasively inhabited world teeming with young foundlings and pathos, and upended by one remarkable little boy. (Dargis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'MAFIOSO' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Italian) This 1962 film, revived by Rialto Pictures, is a rambunctious, astonishing blend of farce, thriller and social satire. The director, Alberto Lattuada, follows an up-and-coming Fiat manager (Alberto Sordi) on a visit from Milan to his native village in Sicily. His homecoming is full of surprises -- painful for him, altogether delightful for the audience. (Scott) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zoë Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis) 'PRIMEVAL' (R, 94 minutes) A giant crocodile named Gustave terrorizes Western journalists in war-torn Burundi. Not as much fun as it might have been, but not as terrible either. (Scott) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) * 'REGULAR LOVERS' (No rating, 175 minutes, in French) Philippe Garrel's tender portrait of late-1960s French youth stars the filmmaker's son, Louis Garrel, as a 20-year-old Parisian struggling through the fires of revolutionary promise and its smoldering remains. Magnificent. (Dargis) 'SCREAMERS' (R, 89 minutes, in English and Armenian) Carla Garapedian's invigorating documentary takes as its jumping-off point the 1915 massacre of Armenian Christians by the Ottoman Empire of Turkey. Focusing on the Armenian-American band System of a Down and its attempts to raise awareness about global suffering, the director traces the historical path of genocide in a film that's part rockumentary, part howl of outrage. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'SERAPHIM FALLS' (R, 111 minutes) Archetypes and symbols solemnly parade through ''Seraphim Falls,'' a handsome, old-fashioned western of few words and heavy meanings that unfolds with the sanctimonious grandeur of a Biblical allegory. In this drama of pursuit, revenge and forgiveness, set in 1868, Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson are soldiers who fought on opposite sides of the Civil War and are now engaged in a life-and-death chase that takes them from the Ruby Mountains of Nevada to a final showdown in the desert. (Holden) 'SMOKIN' ACES' (R, 107 minutes) Absolute garbage. (Scott) 'STOMP THE YARD' (PG-13, 109 minutes) Brotherhood is powerful in this sometimes compelling, sometimes complacent movie about stepping and African-American fraternity life at an Atlanta institution called Truth University. D J (Columbus Short), a street-style dancer, needs to find his place in a university ruled by Gammas and Thetas and stepping. (Rachel Saltz) 'TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Thai) A western weepie from Thailand, filmed in garish color. In spite of the relentless genre pastiche, it has a charming sincerity. (Scott) '2 or 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HIM' (No rating, 85 minutes, in German and Slovak) In this probing documentary, Malte Ludin inquires into the history of his own family: a ''typical German story,'' including a Nazi father executed for war crimes and siblings in various forms of denial. An ambiguous, disturbing portrait emerges of several generations contending with the legacy of the recent German past. (Scott) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) Film Series THE CINEMA OF DONALD CAMMELL (Tonight through Sunday) Best known for his 1970 gender-bending gangster film, ''Performance'' (which he co-directed with Nicolas Roeg), Donald Cammell moved back and forth between commercial filmmaking and the avant-garde with subversive ease. A retrospective of his exceedingly strange work starts tonight at the Walter Reade with a double bill of ''Performance'' (starring Mick Jagger and James Fox) and the reconstructed director's cut of Cammell's final feature, the 1995 ''Wild Side.'' A documentary study of Cammel, ''The Ultlimate Performance,'' directed by Kevin Macdonald and Chris Rodley, will be screened on Sunday and Monday, accompanied by the 14-minute short ''The Argument,'' Cammell's last completed work. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED: MOMA'S ANNUAL FESTIVAL OF NONFICTION FILM (Tonight through Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art's yearly survey of documentary film settles in for a monthlong run with tonight's New York premiere of ''Forever,'' Heddy Honigmann's study of the Paris cemetery Père-Lachaise, and the United States premiere of Avinash Deshpande's ''Great Indian School Show,'' about the headmaster of a boarding school in India who maintains discipline with the help of 85 video cameras installed in the classrooms. (Through March 2.) Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) ENNIO MORRICONE In connection with an appearance at Radio City by this legendary Italian composer of movie music, two local institutions are holding retrospectives of films that he worked on. A series of six features at MoMA continues tonight with a screening of ''The Mission'' (1986), directed by Roland Joffé, and ends on Wednesday with Sergio Leone's ''Once Upon a Time in America'' (1984). A more extensive series at Film Forum begins tonight with a new 35-millimeter print of Elio Petri's politically charged 1970 thriller, ''Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion,'' and continues through the week with rarities like Mario Bava's ''Danger! Diabolik'' (1967) on Tuesday, and Sergio Corbucci's spaghetti western ''Navajo Joe,'' starring Burt Reynolds, on Wednesday.

(Kehr) 'MY DINNER WITH ANDRÉ' and 'SHAFT' (Thursday) A double feature to remember, as MoMA brings back two of the most popular films in the museum's recent ''Made in NY'' program, Louis Malle's 1981 two-handed philosophical comedy, ''My Dinner With André,'' starring Wallace Shawn and André Gregory, and Gordon Parks's urban thriller ''Shaft'' (1971), with Richard Roundtree as a Harlem detective. Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AVENGERS (Tomorrow) A seminal 1970s punk band, the Avengers, from San Francisco, had a brief life but a lasting influence. Over razor-blade guitars, Penelope Houston howled against authority (''Ask not what you can do for your country/What's your country been doing to you?'') and demonstrated to countless young women the liberating power of anger and insolence. This show at the Bowery Ballroom, with Ms. Houston and the original Avengers guitarist, Greg Ingraham, is the only scheduled United States appearance on its latest reunion tour. At 9 p.m., 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Ben Sisario) AWESOME COLOR (Tomorrow) This band's MySpace page gives its location as Bushwick, Brooklyn, ''via southeastern Michigan,'' a pretty accurate geographical summary of its gruff, retro garage-blues: self-consciously noisy in a way only New York rock can be, yet heavily indebted to the Stooges and the MC5. With the Trophy Wives and Dirty Faces. At 8 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Sisario) * DAVID BYRNE (Tonight through Sunday) He may have set a still unsurpassed standard with Talking Heads for art-pop that is as arty as it is truly poppy, but Mr. Byrne's influence reaches much wider than the rock world, into theater, film and, especially, world music. (He also has the best blog of any rock star, at davidbyrne.com.) For his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall he acts as both performer and host. Tonight he presents a multigenerational experimental-folk bill with Devendra Banhart, Vashti Bunyan, Cibelle, Adem, CocoRosie and Vetiver. Tomorrow Mr. Byrne plays songs from ''Here Lies Love,'' his new multimedia cycle about Imelda Marcos. And Sunday is an intriguing program exploring music built around a single note, featuring the ensemble Alarm Will Sound, the Persian-American singer Haale and the French singer Camille, whose ingenious album ''Le Fil'' is a series of vocal variations linked by a constant hummed tone (a B). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall; Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $21 to $70. (Sisario) * BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) This ageless queen of genteel piano bar jazz plays everything from Sondheim to Monk with grace and authority. She sings too. Her rendition of ''Old Friends,'' from ''Merrily We Roll Along,'' will bring tears to your eyes. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $40 dinner or a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) CAT POWER (Sunday and Monday) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the superbly rueful singer known as Cat Power, recorded with a group of veteran Memphis soul players, yielding some of the most stirring -- and happiest -- music of her career. Performing solo, she is spellbindingly intense and mercurial. At 7 p.m., Hiro Ballroom at the Maritime Hotel, 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 260-4700, bowerypresents.com; $25 (sold out on Sunday). (Sisario) BO DIDDLEY (Wednesday) When Bo Diddley plays his namesake beat and growls the metaphysical boasts of ''Who Do You Love?,'' it's easy to hear the fire and syncopation that made him a rock pioneer. Behind them is a profound education in the blues. At 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club & Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $32.50 in advance, $35 at the door. (Jon Pareles) EGYPTIAN LOVER (Tonight) One of the principals of the early Los Angeles hip-hop scene, Greg Broussard, a k a the Egyptian Lover, sticks to the verities of mid-1980s electro-funk: robotic beats straight out of the Kraftwerk playbook, crowd-pleasing turntable tricks and leering, growled vocals borrowed from Prince and Rick James. At 10, Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $8. (Sisario) RICHIE HAVENS (Tonight) An unswerving 1960s holdout, Mr. Havens is still strumming his guitar with untrammeled momentum, still singing in his grainy baritone and still bringing earnest drama out of protests and stubborn optimism. At 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $45. (Pareles) * ESSIE JAIN (Wednesday) A British singer and songwriter who lives in Brooklyn, Ms. Jain builds stark miniatures out of a few light strums of guitar and her haunting alto. On her captivating new album, ''We Made This Ourselves'' (Ba Da Bing), her voice is multitracked in precise harmonies that can be warm or ghostly. With Mike Wexler and Ramona Cordova. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $8. (Sisario) TOBY KEITH (Tonight) A multimillion-selling country star whose ever-present smirk is framed by some manicured stubble and a cowboy hat, Mr. Keith excels equally in salt-of-the-earth patriotic proclamations (''The American Soldier'') and salt-of-the-earth Saturday-night proclamations (''Get Drunk and Be Somebody''). With Miranda Lambert, who was robbed of a victory on ''Nashville Star'' a few years ago but triumphed with a hit album, ''Kerosene.'' At 7:30, Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $27 to $68. (Sisario) KIKI AND HERB (Sunday) A few years ago Kiki and Herb, the world's most brilliantly perverse cabaret duo, played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And some late-night gigs at Joe's Pub. And the annual, inimitable Christmas show. (Highlight: a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'') Kiki and Herb can't stay away from the stage, and New York is the better for it. Their Joe's Pub series continues with a Super Bowl special. At 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) * LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Now in its ninth season, this series has greatly expanded from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like. Tonight is a tribute to the songwriters Alan and Marilyn Bergman (''You Don't Bring Me Flowers,'' ''The Windmills of Your Mind'') with Brian Stokes Mitchell, Sandy Stewart, Melissa Errico, Tyne Daly, Lillias White and somebody named Tony Bennett. Tomorrow John Pizzarelli offers the New York premiere of his show ''Dear Mr. Sinatra.'' Wednesday features the Cherryholmes bluegrass family -- that's Mom, Dad and four kids -- and on Thursday is Calexico, a band from Tucson that began on the avant-garde edge of indie-rock but has eagerly absorbed country, surf guitar, mariachi and fado. Tonight and Wednesday night at 8:30, tomorrow at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., and Thursday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $80. (Sisario) * MAUDE MAGGART (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) In her must-see cabaret show, ''Good Girl/Bad Girl,'' this 31-year-old singer, a knockout in a red dress, uses an astutely chosen selection of songs to explore conflicting female sexual stereotypes from the perspective of a young woman who understands but rejects abject surrender to a man. High point: Joan Baez's ''Love Song to a Stranger.'' At 9, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Oak Room at the Al gonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $25 minimum, with $65 dinner required for the early shows tonight and tomorrow night. (Holden) JAMES McMURTRY, DAVE ALVIN (Tonight) Mr. McMurtry packs a lot of story into his low-key songs: tales of loners and losers adrift in wide-open spaces. His voice is deadpan, but his characters survive grand struggles. In the Blasters, in X and on his own, Mr. Alvin has written and sung about outcasts, lovers and criminals, some of the people who share the road with an itinerant musician. He sets his narratives in country and rockabilly tunes that strive for classic American simplicity, though his words detail an uncertain moral landscape. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $22. (Pareles) RITA MORENO (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) If, at 75, you look as fresh and unbowed as Rita Moreno, you may as well flaunt your age, which is what Ms. Moreno does with zest and humor in ''Little Tributes,'' her breezy new cabaret act. The show is a smooth, comfortable ride with a performer who knows who she is. At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $70 tonight and tomorrow ($50 at the bar); $65 Tuesday through Thursday ($40 at the bar). (Holden) * ENNIO MORRICONE (Tomorrow) This colossus of film music makes an inexplicably late American debut with this concert, conducting a 200-piece orchestra and chorus in his hits. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $60 to $200. (Sisario) JONATHAN RICHMAN (Tonight through Sunday night) No rock star delivers intimacy like Mr. Richman, the eternally youthful and eternally nebbishy granddaddy of New Wave and indie rock. He fell in love with the acoustic guitar decades ago, and backed up by the tiniest of bands -- a drummer playing a snare and little more -- he sings of simple pleasures lost and found with tiptoe dynamics. He finishes a four-night stand, kicking off the Knitting Factory's 20th-anniversary celebration. At 8, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sisario) MARTIN SEXTON (Tuesday) This singer and songwriter can groan like an alternative rocker, slide like a soul man or leap up to a pearly falsetto. Singing about restlessness and love while he picks syncopations on his guitar, Mr. Sexton can turn an ordinary song into a jazzy showcase, and a good one into a transmission from the heart. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Pareles) ROD STEWART (Thursday) His four Great American Songbook albums may not represent the most distinguished readings of those songs -- ditto his Bob Seger and Creedence Clearwater Revival on the recent ''Still the Same Great Rock Classics of Our Time'' (J) -- but when Rod Stewart lets go of his smugness, that whisky tenor of his can be a powerful interpretive instrument. Doesn't happen often, though. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $55 to $129.50. (Sisario) * JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE (Wednesday) Like Michael Jackson or Prince, Mr. Timberlake is the kind of pop star who makes it all look easy. But even more endearing, the guy can truly make fun of himself: his brilliant ''Saturday Night Live'' skit with Andy Samberg, broadcast in bleeped form and uncensored on the Internet, was the equivalent of a chummy high-five with his audience. Opening the show is Pink, the spark plug who once bragged of getting the party started and now ridicules ''stupid girls'' who torture themselves for men. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; sold out. (Sisario) VIEUX FARKA TOURÉ (Thursday) Who knew that Ali Farka Touré, the Malian guitar sage who died a year ago, had a son ready to take on the family legacy? Vieux Farka Touré, 25, began playing guitar in secret because his father had wanted him to become a soldier; Dad eventually relented and entrusted his son's education to a friend, the visionary kora player Toumani Diabaté. Mr. Touré's self-titled first album, to be released this month by World Village, is an impressive reflection of the spare, trancelike blues of his father, and here he makes his New York debut. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15.

(Nate Chinen) * STEFANO BOLLANI (Tuesday) Mr. Bollani, a charismatic Italian pianist, has a new album, ''Piano Solo'' (ECM), that ranges in tone from pensive to puckish; it's a breadth of temperament he is likely to cover here as well.

Opera 'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) The tenor Marcello Giordani did not sing flawlessly when he took over the role of Rodolfo recently in the Metropolitan Opera's revival of its crowd-pleasing Franco Zeffirelli production of Puccini's ''Bohème.'' But he may be the best we have right now in the lyric, yet full-bodied, Puccini and Verdi tenor roles, and he can certainly bring rich sound and stylistic elegance to Rodolfo's ardent vocal lines. Cristina Gallardo-Domâs is his earthy-voiced but expressive Mimì. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Perennially beloved and always hard-hitting, ''Cav/Pag'' offers two fine sopranos in Dolora Zajick and Krassimira Stoyanova, as well as the notable tenor Salvatore Licitra.

(Bernard Holland) 'JENUFA' (Tonight and Tuesday night) The Finnish soprano Karita Mattila is riveting in the title role of Janacek's grim, insightful and, by the end, consoling Czech opera ''Jenufa,'' the Met's revival of its 2003 production by Olivier Tambosi. Ms. Mattila's gleaming voice is ideal for this character, a trusting young woman in a Moravian village who has become pregnant by her cousin. The German soprano Anja Silja is at once terrifying and pitiable as Jenufa's stepmother, Kostelnicka. Jiri Belohlavek conducts a sensitive and sweeping account of Janacek's score, presented in its 1908 version. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $205. (Tommasini) * 'I PURITANI' (Monday and Thursday) The reason the Met dusted off its stodgy old 1976 production of Bellini's ''Puritani,'' and the one compelling reason to see it, is Anna Netrebko. This glamorous, dusky-voiced Russian soprano makes an affecting and vocally lustrous Elvira, the daughter of a stern Puritan father during the English Civil War whose sanity slips away when she thinks her adored Arturo, a Royalist sympathizer, is unfaithful. Ms. Netrebko may not be a bel canto purist's ideal. But she sings excitingly and stops the show with her Act II Mad Scene. On the illness-plagued opening night, only the fine bass-baritone John Relyea, singing Elvira's kindly uncle, despite grappling with remnants of bronchitis, was in the same dramatic class as the star. Patrick Summers conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini) * 'IL SIGNOR BRUSCHINO' (Tomorrow) The Gotham Chamber Opera presents a stylish, witty and genuinely funny new production of Rossini's one-act farce ''Il Signor Bruschino.'' The action is updated to the Via Veneto of Rome around 1960, with Felliniesque touches like priests and Vespas. The good-looking and talented cast members have fearless fun with the bel canto fireworks, while Robin Guarino's sharp directing means ''Bruschino,'' a typical opera buffa of mistaken identities, is far more than mere slapstick. At 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200, gothamchamberopera.org; $30 to $65. (Vivien Schweitzer) Classical Music * ALLOY ORCHESTRA (Wednesday and Thursday) A small ''orchestra'' indeed, Alloy is a three-man ensemble devoted to creating soundtracks for classic silent films, using instruments from synthesizers to (literally) a rack of junk (''percussion'' in high-culture parlance). The Winter Garden is presenting three of its specialties: ''Blackmail,'' Hitchcock's last silent film, on Wednesday; ''The Eagle,'' with Rudolph Valentino, on Thursday; and ''The General,'' with Buster Keaton, a week from tonight. At 7 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Anne Midgette) * ARTEMIS QUARTET (Wednesday) This exciting Berlin-based string quartet does not come to New York often enough. Its program may seem heavy-duty, but it is sure to be engrossing. Webern's ''Langsamer Satz'' should be an ideal warm-up for Beethoven's Quartet in E minor (Op. 59, No. 2). After intermission the quartet takes on Schoenberg's extraordinary Quartet No. 1. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $44. (Tommasini) * BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday) This floating concert hall is featuring the pianist-conductor Vladimir Stoupel and the violinist Judith Ingolfsson playing works that, while not new, will receive their United States premieres. Tonight a solo recital by Mr. Stoupel includes a piece by Peter Ruzicka, former head of the Salzburg Festival, ''Ausgeweidet die Zeit '' (1969) as well as works by Schubert and Schumann. Tomorrow and Sunday Ms. Ingolfsson joins the pianist for an ''Offerto'' by Haflidi Hallgrimsson, as well as sonatas by Schumann and Schubert, and Ravel's ''Tzigane.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65+, tonight only. (Midgette) BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) The Brooklyn Philharmonic, led by Michael Christie, looks Down Under for inspiration in a concert that opens its 53rd season. The program, ''Earth Awakened,'' begins with ''Mangrove'' and ''Earth Cry'' by the Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe, featuring his compatriot William Barton on didgeridoo. The orchestra will then be joined by Nicholas Leichter's dance troupe, which will perform a premiere set to Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, brooklynphilharmonic.org; $20 to $60; $10 for students. (Schweitzer) CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA OF ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA (Wednesday) Kent Tritle conducts a feast of the Baroque from the Roman Catholic Church, including pieces by Domenico Zipoli, Tomás Luis de Victoria and Vivaldi. At 8 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue, at 84th Street, (212) 288-2520, saintignatiusloyola.org; $25 to $45. (Holland) COMPOSER PORTRAIT: FRANK ZAPPA (Tonight) Even in the early days of his rock career, Frank Zappa was fascinated by contemporary composers and began to assemble a catalog of orchestral, chamber and keyboard scores. Some of those, along with arrangements of some of Zappa's more far-reaching rock works, are included in this installment of the Miller Theater's Composer Portraits series. The performers are the Fireworks Ensemble and the Zephyros Winds. At 8, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25; $12 for students. (Allan Kozinn) CONCERTANTE (Sunday) The pianist Adam Neiman joins the six string soloists of this acclaimed young ensemble for Dvorak's second piano quartet and Bagatelles for Two Violins, Cello and Harmonium on a program that also includes Erwin Schulhoff's string sextet. At 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $20. (Midgette) * LISE DE LA SALLE (Tomorrow) Still a teenager, this gifted French pianist has been making waves for several years with big, strong, impressive playing. Peoples' Symphony Concerts presents her in a program that contrasts Mozart and Prokofiev, who are also the focus of a forthcoming recording by Ms. de la Salle. At 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9. (Midgette) 'THE ELECTRONIC SHOFAR' (Tomorrow) The shofar, an ancient instrument made from a ram's horn, is heard these days most frequently during the Jewish High Holy Day services. But some contemporary composers have found its strong, piercing timbre useful, among them Alvin Curran and Bob Gluck, who have each created works that combine the shofar's timbre with electronic sound processing. They share a concert at which they will perform their recent shofar works. At 8 p.m., Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (888) 749-9998, emf.org; $10 suggested donation. (Kozinn) * TILL FELLNER (Thursday) The sensitive and resourceful Austrian pianist Till Fellner is next in the Met Museum's ''Piano Forte'' series. His performances of works by Beethoven, Bach and Schubert should be rewarding. Count on his survey of Bach's Three-Part Inventions to be exquisite, at least on the basis of his distinguished recording of Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Book I. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Tommasini) * FLUX QUARTET (Thursday) This enterprising new-music quartet offers works by Skip LaPlante, Alvin Lucier, Bunita Marcus, Roscoe Mitchell, Elliott Sharp and Tom Chiu. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $10; $7 for students. (Kozinn) * FOCUS FESTIVAL (Tonight) The Juilliard School's annual new-music festival turns its sights this year on Hungarian music since Bartok. The closing program includes two of Hungary's most famous composers, Gyorgy Kurtag and Gyorgy Ligeti, as well as two others, Endre Szervanszky and Laszlo Tihanyi, who are less well known but, judging by this festival's track record, are likely to be worth investigating. Diego Masson conducts the Juilliard Orchestra. At 8, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn) NEW YORK COLLEGIUM (Thursday) Musicians often perform and teach in schools, but they rarely bring students onstage with them. For five years, the New York Collegium has worked with students in kindergarten through the eighth grade at the Ella Baker School. On Thursday the children will join the early-music specialists of the Collegium for ''Ancient and Traditional: Tunes From Around the World,'' a concert of music from medieval Europe, Renaissance Spain and North America. At 7:30 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 717-9246, nycollegium.org; $30. (Schweitzer) NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG (Wednesday and Thursday) Offering a smorgasbord of song seasoned with Steven Blier's smart and witty commentary from the keyboard, this recital series sometimes goes back to dishes it has done well with before. ''Dvorak and the American Soul'' is a recapitulation from 2002; the program presents works by Dvorak and his American students, like Harry T. Burleigh and Will Marion Cook. At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $45; $35 for 65+. (Midgette) * NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) Esa-Pekka Salonen, the dynamic conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, is in town for a program with our own Philharmonic, offering music by Ravel, Mussorgsky and the world premiere of Mr. Salonen's piano concerto, with Yefim Bronfman as soloist. On Tuesday, for a ''Hear and Now'' program, Mr. Salonen will discuss his concerto with the composer Steven Stucky, and then conduct a performance. On Thursday Alan Gilbert conducts works by Daniel Börtz, Debussy and Beethoven (the First Piano Concerto, with Lars Vogt). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday at 6:45 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96; $10 to $35 on Tuesday. (Tommasini) 'ORATORIO TEREZIN' (Wednesday and Thursday) Ruth Fazal, an English violinist and composer who now lives in Canada has written an oratorio about Theresienstadt, or Terezin, the concentration camp near Prague. For her text Ms. Fazal used children's poetry written at the camp, as well as passages from the Hebrew Scriptures. The performers include Teresa Maria Gomez, soprano; Huw Priday, tenor; and Nathaniel Watson, baritone, with Kirk Trevor conducting the Perspectives Ensemble Orchestra, Young People's Chorus of New York City, singers from the New Streams Children's Choir of Toronto and Bratislava Boys Choir and the Mendelssohn Singers of Toronto. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100, tillescenter.org; $25 to $50. Thursday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $50. (Kozinn) ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Stanford Olsen pays a visit in Britten's ravishing Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings. Martinu and Mozart are the rest of the program. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $88. (Holland) * ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) This ensemble is so popular that its concerts in April are already sold out, and so are its performances next week at the Morgan Library. If you haven't snagged a ticket to the Morgan, try and catch the ensemble at the Brooklyn Museum, where it will play the same program: ''Four, Five, Six'' includes Mendelssohn's Quintet in A (Op. 18), Joan Tower's ''In Memory'' and Brahms's Sextet (Op. 18). Sunday at 2 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park; $25; $20 for museum members. Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street; sold out. Information: (212) 594-6100 or oslmusic.org. (Schweitzer) JORY VINIKOUR (Sunday) The Music Before 1800 series presents Mr. Vinikour, a Paris-based American harpsichordist, who will perform Bach's Partita in D and Handel's Suite in G minor and Chaconne in G. Mr. Vinikour, who has appeared in recital with the singers David Daniels, Magdalena Kozena and Anne Sofie von Otter, has performed premieres of works by Frank Martin and Harold Meltzer. At 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266; mb1800.org; $25 to $40; $5 off for students and 62+. (Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * BIG DANCE THEATER (Wednesday and Thursday) Annie-B Parsons and Paul Lazar, Big's wildly imaginative choreographer and director, explore the stories of the contemporary novelist Masuji Ibuse just in time for the start of Japan Society's celebration of its yearlong centennial. (Through Feb. 10.) At 7:30 p.m., Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $35. (Jennifer Dunning) COOL NEW YORK 2007 (Tonight through Sunday) Young Soon Kim, the tireless producer of free dance showcase festivals, is at it again. Part of the fun, in addition to the grab-bag serendipity of each event, is her welcoming little studio theater. Tonight at 7 and 9; tomorrow at 2, 7 and 9 p.m.; Sunday at 4 and 6 p.m. White Wave's John Ryan Theater, 25 Jay Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com (Dunning) DANCE CONVERSATIONS @ THE FLEA (Tuesday) This free series of dance and talk begins with a program of work by four newish choreographers, moderated by Yoshiko Chuma. At 7 p.m., the Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 645-6462, theflea.org. (Dunning) DANCEWAVE'S KIDS COMPANY (Thursday) These child performers, who dance decidedly grown-up works, will present a gala benefit program that includes excerpts from Twyla Tharp's ''Fugue.'' The former Tharp dancers John Carrafa, Thomas Rawe and Jennifer Way-Rawe will also perform. Aat 7:30 p.m., Kumble Theater, Long Island University Brooklyn Campus, Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues, Downtown Brooklyn, (718) 522-4696, dancewave.org; $50 and $100. (Dunning) * D D DORVILLIER (Tonight and tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday nights) Ms. Dorvillier describes her new ''Nottthing Is Importanttt'' as a cinema performance, incorporating video and a ''dark and sound environment.'' Whatever all that means, Ms. Dorvillier's wild, intuitive and visual imagination is usually reason enough to take the plunge. (Through Feb. 10.) At 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11; thekitchen.org; $12. (Dunning) 'FRIDAYS @ NOON' (Today) Participants in the latest installment of this free dance-and-talk series are Regina Nejman, Anna Sperger and Megan Sprenger, who will perform new and unfinished dances. At noon, Harkness Dance Center, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92Y.org. (Dunning) HAMBURG BALLET (Wednesday and Thursday) The ballet choreographer New York ballet fans love to hate, John Neumeier, makes big, operatic, narrative ballets. This one is ''Death in Venice,'' which he describes as a ''free adaptation of the novella by Thomas Mann.'' (Through Feb. 10.) At 7:30 p.m., Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $70. (Dunning) BILL T. JONES/ARNIE ZANE DANCE COmpany (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Jones and his dancers like to provoke thought as well as enjoyment of the company's high-powered performing. This engagement features ''Another Evening, I Bow Down,'' set to live music by Daniel Bernard Roumain that blends funk, heavy metal, hip-hop and classical influences. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $44. (Dunning) KINETIC DANCE THEATER (Tonight) Directed by Joanna and Ryan Greer, the company will perform ''I'll Take Summer,'' a new cabaret-dance piece that celebrates that sunny season. (Repeated Feb. 11, 16 and 19.) At 9, Don't Tell Mama, 343 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 757-0788, kineticdancetheater.org; $10 cover, two-drink minimum. (Dunning) * Isabel Lewis/Erika Hand and Katie Workum/Will Rawls (Wednesday and Thursday) With four choreographers on tap, this split bill seems almost like a sampler in disguise, but with performers like Mr. Rawls and Ms. Lewis, who are we to quibble? (Through Feb. 10.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $12 and $20. (Claudia La Rocco) MIRO MAGLOIRE'S NEW CHAMBER BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Magloire's knowledge and love of music shine through his unaffected ballet choreography. Deborah Lohse is guest choreographer. At 8:30, City Center Studio 4, 130 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Thursday) Tonight's ''Balanchine and Robbins: Masters at Work'' promises to be of special interest, considering that it includes a major revival of Jerome Robbins's dark ''Dybbuk'' and Kyra Nichols leading ''Serenade,'' George Balanchine's first American ballet, partnered by Philip Neal in a fine cast that also includes Ashley Bouder, Maria Kowroski and Stephen Hanna. Balanchine's ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' completes the program, which will be repeated tomorrow and Wednesday nights this week. Other programs are ''Essential Balanchine'' (tomorrow afternoon) and ''Tribute to Kirstein,'' which includes Balanchine's sumptuous ''Vienna Waltzes'' (Sunday, Monday and Thursday). Miranda Weese, whose retirement from the company at the end of the season will be a major loss, was extraordinary in her musical phrasing and her daring in a recent performance of the Frühlingsstimmen waltz in ''Vienna Waltzes.'' She is scheduled to dance it, again with an impressive Benjamin Millepied, at all three performances this week. (Through Feb. 25.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $30 to $82. (Dunning) PILOBOLUS DANCE THEATER (Tonight) The dreamlike visual imagery and humor of Pilobolus will be on view in a program that includes ''Prism,'' ''Gnomen,'' ''Memento Mori,'' ''Megawatt'' and the solo from ''Empty Suitor.'' At 8, Tilles Center for the Performing Arts at Long Island University's C. W. Post Campus, Route 25A, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100, tillescenter.org; $40 to $65; $37 to $62 for 65+. (Dunning) * TAMAR ROGOFF'S 'EDITH & JENNY' (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Rogoff's piece alludes to the childhood friendship of her daughter, Ariel Rogoff Flavin, and Claire Danes, who trained in dance before becoming a film actress, as well as roles each played as 11-year-olds in films by Jeff Mueller. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 5 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288, ps122.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) jill sigman/thinkdance (Thursday) What have you broken? What have you lost? How do you want to die? Send your answers to rupture07@gmail.com, and then check out a performance of ''Rupture'' to see how your thoughts fit into Ms. Sigman's choreographic vision. (Through Feb. 11.) At 8:30 p.m. Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $10 and $15.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: MARTíN RAMíREZ, through April 29. Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. In addition to being one of the season's best exhibitions and the first of his work in a New York museum, this show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith) * Grey Art Gallery: 'Semina Culture: Wallace Berman & His Circle,' through March 31. The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) may ring only a faint bell to many New Yorkers, but he was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780. (Holland Cotter) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Henri Cartier-Bresson's Scrapbook: Photographs, 1932-46,' through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It's an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. He became a celebrity in America. He photographed Fred Astaire dancing and Joan Crawford poolside. In the breezy layouts of Harper's Bazaar, the work looked brilliant. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. The 100 paintings and drawings on display here are by 10 artists, including George Grosz, Christian Schad and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble; we look into the faces of museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * The MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) * Museum of Modern Art: 'DOUG AITKEN: SLEEPWALKERS,' through Feb. 12. Produced in concert with Creative Time Inc., this monumental video projection, screened nightly (from 5 to 10) on three sides of the sleek exterior of the newly expanded Museum of Modern Art, consists of short, silent and rather too glamorous meditations on the working nights of five emblematic New Yorkers played somnolently by actors and musicians who include Donald Sutherland and Tilda Swinton. But Mr. Aitken's astute and restless cinematic ambition and commanding sense of scale are in full force, especially in the more abstract portions of the piece, resulting in a fitting ode to the city that never sleeps and that the camera has always loved. (212) 708-9400, daily. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter) Galleries: SoHo * Stephen G. Rhodes: 'Recurrency' It's great when someone gets ambitiously complicated and makes it work, as the young Los Angeles-based artist Stephen G. Rhodes does in his first solo show. Formally, he juggles video, sculpture, photographs and drawings, and hooks them up in a circling narrative that richochets from 19th-century fiction to B films to Hurricane Katrina. The play of history, fiction and recent reality that results is memorably atmospheric. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, (212) 625-9224, www.guildgreyshkul.com, through Feb. 10. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * PIA MARIA MARTIN, HAERI YOO, YUH-SHIOH WONG A sense of dismemberment and its converse (reassemblage) courses through this nicely raucous show. Somewhat à la Dana Schutz, Haeri Yoo splays drawn and painted figures across walls and occasionally canvases, intimating a picnic or maybe childbirth. Yuh-Shioh Wong's polymorphous installation uses discarded materials, especially wood, mirrors and Styrofoam, to revisit Cubism and Surrealism at once. In ''March to the Gallows,'' Pia Maria Martin's stop-action animation, a bodiless chicken pulls itself together to the tune of Berlioz's ''Symphonie Fanatastique.'' Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 727-2050, thomaserben.com, through Feb. 10 . (Smith) * JACCO OLIVIER Yet another painter working in animation might seem a little tiresome. But these wistful filmed animations of loosely brushed seascapes and landscapes by Jacco Olivier are perfectly lovely. It is no revelation that he is from the Netherlands -- Dutch artists more or less invented landscape imagery in the late 16th century. This artist updates the genre, taking us on colorful sensory journeys, usually of no more than a minute, through the towns and countryside around Amsterdam. The imagery is marvelously painterly, with the individual frames sometimes bordering on abstraction, though the narrative structure owes much to the techniques of film. Mr. Olivier's peculiar genius is to have effortlessly combined them. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street, (212) 680-9889, www.marianboeskygallery.com, through Feb. 17. (Benjamin Genocchio) AMY YOES: REARVIEW MIRROR This three-part show progresses organically from black and white to ringing color, small to large, and still photography to installation and video. As it goes, the principles of set-up photography are set in motion and enlarged to walk-in scale. If the small, elegant photographs that get the ball rolling remain the strongest work, the ensemble still brims with ambition and possibility. Michael Steinberg Fine Art, 529 West 26th Street, (212) 924-5770, www.michaelsteinbergfineart.com, through Feb. 10. (Smith) Last Chance JOHN EVANS: HAPPY NEW YEAR! This show contains a winsome review of Mr. Evans's 37-year, collage-a-day habit, but the main event is the five rarely seen black-on-raw-canvas paintings from the 1970s, whose charcoal tones and collage-like arrangements of semi-abstract textures and motifs -- from a swastika to caning to shag carpet -- are both lush and barbed. They presage much that befell painting in the decade ahead. Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 533 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7490, www.pavelzoubok.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * BRENT GREEN: 'Paulina Hollers' Mr. Green makes charmingly crude stop-motion animation shorts using wood-carved figurines, found props and childish drawings, an eyebrow-raising selection of which is now at Bellwether for his first New York solo show. Typically they deal with death -- though only 28, Mr. Green has a sullenly melancholy bent that's generally at odds with the carefree fare produced by artists his age. The inexplicable allure of these odd, dark films is further enhanced by their unusual, improvised soundtracks of the artist's riffing on instruments with his buddies while yelling out a narration like a crazed preacher. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-5959, www.bellwethergallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio) * Robert Irwin: 'Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue 3' In the past Robert Irwin has paid homage to Joseph Albers. Now he makes a bow to a different kind of perceptual magician, Barnett Newman, turning Newman's 1966-70 paintings titled ''Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue'' into a kind of self-reflective architecture. Optical illusionism has long been Mr. Irwin's calling card, but here he has achieved it by bare-bones means, offering quieting visual fare for an overstimulated world. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-4258, pacewildenstein.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * PORTIA MUNSON: GREEN On the floor, all manner of discarded plastic objects and cheap toys coalesce into a dense scatter piece that commemorates the fall of nature, the rise of suburbia and the varied tonalities of indigenous if artificial green. On the walls, exquisite mille-fleur-like color photographs made on a scanner redirect set-up photography back toward the experimental nature prints and photogenic drawings of the 19th century. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-1043, www.ppowgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) SCOTT REEDER: NEW WORK In his fourth New York gallery show, the polymath artist Scott Reeder has returned to canvas (from shaped Styrofoam) and lowered the cute quotient without forsaking either his sense of humor or his taste for slightly tarnished pastels. He continues to riff on Modernism, as suggested by ''Still Life With Grenades,'' ''Money in Bed'' and a Ken Noland circle titled ''Continuous Hotdog.'' This is a transitional show, but the idea of Mr. Reeder expanding his painting repertory while sharpening his acerbic edge is intriguing. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, www.danielreichgallery.com; through tomorrow. (Smith)

Broadway 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in rural Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THAT I WILL EVER BE' In this false-feeling comedy-drama by Alan Ball, creator of ''Six Feet Under,'' a gay hustler undergoes an identity crisis when he finds himself falling for one of his clients. Slick but mostly stale in its analysis of a society afraid of emotional engagement (2:15). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'ANON.' Kate Robin's savvy, dark romantic comedy about sexual addiction doesn't live up to its potential (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DUTCHMAN' A revival of the poet Amiri Baraka's screed on race and American values, 43 years after its Greenwich Village debut, aims for all the fire and might of a Malcolm X speech but none of the rhetorical elegance. It shouts so loudly that you can't hear a thing (1:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE FEVER' Wallace Shawn performs his provocative monologue about a guilt-riddled bourgeois everyman sweating his way through a moral crisis. The rich, often hypnotic writing draws us into his tortured mindscape, as he shifts between shame over his sense of entitlement and reasoned arguments that sacrifice is unnecessary and pointless. Meanwhile, in the third world, the violence and poverty continue unabated (1:30). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'FRANK'S HOME' Peter Weller plays Frank Lloyd Wright in Richard Nelson's dreary bio-drama, which lingers lovingly on its subject's feet of clay while paying arid lip service to his genius (1:45). Playwrights Horizons Mainstage, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 719-4200. (Isherwood) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates) 'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates) 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' and 'THE JEW OF MALTA' F. Murray Abraham plays two Elizabethan villains in repertory for the Theater for a New Audience. Mr. Abraham's sinister but still moving Shylock is the dark heart of Darko Tresnjak's chilly, powerful staging of one of Shakespeare's unfunniest comedies. As Barabas in David Herskovits's goofy, postmodern ''Jew of Malta,'' he's the lively center of a carnival that doesn't do justice to Christopher Marlowe's harsh satire on Christian hypocrisy and venality (each 2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'A SPANISH PLAY' The great Zoe Caldwell returns to the New York stage after an absence of a decade, in the fine company of Linda Emond, Denis O'Hare and Larry Pine. That's the good news. The bad? The play. Yasmina Reza's pseudo-philosophical and metatheatrical trifle is utterly forgettable (1:50). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) * 'TOYS IN THE ATTIC' Austin Pendleton's fine revival of Lillian Hellman's last play faithfully attacks the corrosive attachments of family. What good is a family, and thus a society, the play implicitly asks, that can only look in the mirror? (2:30) Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'VICTORIA MARTIN: MATH TEAM QUEEN' Must all stage teenagers speak in that exaggerated surfer-dude style in which ''awesome'' and ''totally'' make up about 50 percent of any conversation? Yes, apparently they must, from the evidence presented in this thin comedy, which is about a high school girl who finds herself on the all-male math team. The playwright, Kathryn Walat, seems to have been trying to grab the coattails of a certain spelling-bee-related show. She missed (2:00). The Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, , 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL' Five vignettes about finding love and keeping it as immature in attitude as they are thin in substance. The filmmaker Anthony Minghella, whose offering here is a short play called ''Hang Up,'' provides the silliest (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Bellafante) 'GONE' In this 90-minute meditation on grief and mourning, composed as a pastiche of texts from Proust, Sophocles, Allen Ginsberg and others, the playwright Charles Mee's habitual postmodern techniques prove utterly inadequate to his subject matter. The piece is fuzzy and diffuse and leaves an impression of evading the suffering it refers to (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE GREAT DIVORCE' The Magis Theater Company makes a creditable effort to explore spiritual matters in this adaptation of C. S. Lewis's story about a bus trip through the afterlife. In well-acted vignettes, characters are led to examine their lives and ruling loves. It's often intriguing, and rarely preachy (1:30). Salvation Army Theater, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'NO GREAT SOCIETY' The brainy experimentalists of Elevator Repair Service provide a madcap and almost dreamlike re-enactment of a 1968 episode of William F. Buckley's ''Firing Line,'' which features Mr. Buckley squaring off with Jack Kerouac (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'THE SCENE' Theresa Rebeck's latest is a sharp-witted, sharp-elbowed comedy about the savage economies of sex and show business in Manhattan. Tony Shalhoub plays an out-of-work actor, Charlie, happily married -- but not really -- to Patricia Heaton's frazzled chat show booker. Enter the femme fatale Clea, played by the gifted Anna Camp, and goodbye, Charlie (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ALPHA DOG' (R, 117 minutes) Based on a true Southern California crime, Nick Cassavetes's entertaining exploitation flick features a lot of attractive, talented young actors shimmying across the screen while embodying the collective parental nightmare. Do you know where your children are? Well, in this film they're getting busy, chilling out, smoking blunts and chugging coolers faster than a toothless wino. Oh, and committing murder. (Manohla Dargis) 'ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES' (PG, 94 minutes) Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy (Freddie Highmore) who shrinks to microscopic size to find some gems and his missing grandfather. Lots of famous names (Madonna, Robert De Niro, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg) lend their voices to the computerized part of the movie, but only briefly near the end does everything click. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott) 'BECAUSE I SAID SO' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore as mother and daughter. What did she say, exactly? Whatever it was, it wasn't as funny as it should have been. (Scott) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn misery into entertainment. (Dargis) 'BREAKING AND ENTERING' (R, 119 minutes) This high-toned, feel-bad exercise in liberal guilt comes from Anthony Minghella, who brings the same earnest humorlessness to present-day London that he has brought to the historical past. Jude Law is an architect; Juliette Bi noche is a Bosnian seamstress; and Vera Farmiga provides a glimmer of wit and liveliness as a Russian prostitute who shows up to drink coffee, show her underwear and discuss the themes of the movie. (Scott) 'BURNING ANNIE' (No rating, 95 minutes) This thoroughly postmodern romantic comedy concerns a college student (Gary Lundy) whose obsession with Woody Allen's movie ''Annie Hall'' stunts his ability to live in reality and have normal relationships. While thoroughly professional in its execution, it unfortunately has no life of its own, apart from its fascination with Mr. Allen's film. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'CATCH AND RELEASE' (PG-13, 124 minutes ) Jennifer Garner is a young woman in Boulder, Colo., coping with the sudden death of her fiancé, who she discovers had another, secret life. Although there are signs that the first-time director Susannah Grant (screenwriter of ''Erin Brockovich'') was reaching for something more layered than a formulaic ''chick flick,'' the story never achieves basic credibility. At least its affection for its characters doesn't seem cynical. (Stephen Holden) * 'THE CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis) 'CONSTELLATION' (PG-13, 96 minutes) The writer-director Jordan Walker-Pearlman's drama about a biracial extended family of Alabamans convening to bury a matriarch, Carmel (Gabrielle Union), explores the generational aftershocks of racist violence with frank honesty and manages to be a decent ensemble romantic comedy in the bargain. If only the film weren't so boringly conceived. The powerhouse cast -- which includes David Clennon, Billy Dee Williams and Lesley Anne Warren -- escapes unscathed. (Seitz) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) * 'EAST OF HAVANA' (No rating, 82 minutes, in Spanish) With Jauretsi Saizorbitoria and Emilia Menocal as co-directors, this compelling nonfiction feature shows young Cuban rappers exercising the artist's prerogative to tell the truth in a country that muzzles free speech. The filmmakers -- who are Cuban-American themselves -- zero in on a collective called El Cartel. Although the film is set in 2004 -- during the run-up to the International Festival of Rap Cubano and in the shadow of Hurricane Charley -- there's no phony urgency to the setup. The filmmakers are mainly interested in hearing the music and learning about the musicians' compelling personal stories. (Seitz) 'EPIC MOVIE' (PG-13, 86 minutes) A cheap, dumb parody of expensive, dumb movies. (Scott) 'FACTORY GIRL' (R, 91 minutes) It's not entirely inappropriate that this film, George Hickenlooper's biography of Edie Sedgwick, the most glamorous of Andy Warhol's so-called superstars, should suggest a magazine layout masquerading as a film. The world through which Sedgwick (Sienna Miller) blazed and burned out was one that lived and died by the camera. It existed to be seen and drooled over. But God help you if you actually lived in it. (Holden) 'IN THE PIT' (No rating, 84 minutes, in Spanish) In his absorbing documentary about work and the transformation of men into laborers, the Mexican filmmaker Juan Carlos Rulfo gets down and dirty, literally and existentially. (Dargis) 'THE ITALIAN' (PG-13, 99 minutes, in Russian) This dark fairy tale from Russia pulls you into a richly atmospheric, persuasively inhabited world teeming with young foundlings and pathos, and upended by one remarkable little boy. (Dargis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'MAFIOSO' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Italian) This 1962 film, revived by Rialto Pictures, is a rambunctious, astonishing blend of farce, thriller and social satire. The director, Alberto Lattuada, follows an up-and-coming Fiat manager (Alberto Sordi) on a visit from Milan to his native village in Sicily. His homecoming is full of surprises -- painful for him, altogether delightful for the audience. (Scott) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zoë Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) 'PUCCINI FOR BEGINNERS' (No rating, 81 minutes) Snappy repartee with the ring of real conversation among people who are never at a loss for a remark is something every self-respecting Manhattan sophisticate imagines can be channeled into a screenplay with the crackle of vintage Woody Allen. That elusive tone is sustained through enough of Maria Maggenti's film ''Puccini For Beginners'' to make this screwball comedy of sexual confusion with lesbian inclinations a rarity. (Holden) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) * 'REGULAR LOVERS' (No rating, 175 minutes, in French) Philippe Garrel's tender portrait of late-1960s French youth stars the filmmaker's son, Louis Garrel, as a 20-year-old Parisian struggling through the fires of revolutionary promise and its smoldering remains. Magnificent. (Dargis) 'SERAPHIM FALLS' (R, 111 minutes) Archetypes and symbols solemnly parade through ''Seraphim Falls,'' a handsome, old-fashioned western of few words and heavy meanings that unfolds with the sanctimonious grandeur of a Biblical allegory. In this drama of pursuit, revenge and forgiveness, set in 1868, Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson are soldiers who fought on opposite sides of the Civil War and are now engaged in a life-and-death chase that takes them from the Ruby Mountains of Nevada to a final showdown in the desert. (Holden) 'THE SITUATION' (No rating, 106 minutes, in English and Arabic) Connie Nielsen stars as a correspondent sniffing around wartime Iraq in a narcoleptic thriller directed by Philip Haas from a screenplay by the journalist Wendell Steavenson. (Dargis) 'SMOKIN' ACES' (R, 107 minutes) Absolute garbage. (Scott) 'STOMP THE YARD' (PG-13, 109 minutes) Brotherhood is powerful in this sometimes compelling, sometimes complacent movie about stepping and African-American fraternity life at an Atlanta institution called Truth University. D J (Columbus Short), a street-style dancer, needs to find his place in a university ruled by Gammas and Thetas and stepping. (Rachel Saltz) 'TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Thai) A western weepie from Thailand, filmed in garish color. In spite of the relentless genre pastiche, it has a charming sincerity. (Scott) 'AN UNREASONABLE MAN' (No rating, 122 minutes) A very reasonable documentary about the long career of Ralph Nader as a consumer advocate and, more recently and vexingly to some of his former admirers, a perennial presidential candidate. (Scott) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) Film Series FRANK BEYER: IN MEMORIAM (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Mr. Beyer, who died in October at 74, was one of the few filmmakers in East Germany able to establish a personality of his own, while occasionally slipping subversive political messages into his work. This two-film program at MoMA includes the internationally successful Holocaust drama ''Jacob the Liar.'' Starring Vlastimil Brodsky as a Jewish man who broadcasts falsely optimistic news from his apartment in a Polish ghetto, ''Jacob'' will be introduced tonight by Professor Barton Byg, the director of the East German film collection at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. (The film will be repeated on Sunday). Tomorrow, Mr. Beyer's ''Naked Among Wolves'' (1963) is set at the Buchenwald concentration camp, where a group of inmates sacrifice everything to protect a small boy, unaware that the Allied liberation forces are approaching. ''Naked'' will be repeated on Thursday. (Through Feb. 22.) Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) CRITICS CHOICE: GREAT DOCUMENTARIES (Tomorrow and Sunday) This two-month program of recent documentaries chosen and introduced by members of the New York Film Critics Circle continues with Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer presenting Barbet Schroeder's 1974 film ''General Idi Amin Dada'' (tomorrow); Marshall Fine of Star introducing Barbara Kopple's 1991 ''American Dream,'' with Ms. Kopple present (tomorrow, followed by a screening of her own new film, directed with Cecila Peck, ''Shut Up and Sing''); Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly showing Adam Curtis's epic ''The Century of the Self'' (Sunday); and David Edelstein of New York magazine presenting ''Our Brand Is Crisis,'' Rachel Boynton's study of James Carville working on the 2002 Bolivian presidential campaign (Sunday; Ms. Boynton will attend a post-screening discussion.) (Through Feb. 25.) Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, www.movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) FILM COMMENT SELECTS (Wednesday and Thursday) A two-week series of overlooked recent films chosen by the editors of Film Comment, the publication of the Film Society of Lincoln Center. The series begins on Wednesday with Jean-Claude Brisseau's controversial ''Exterminating Angels,'' his loosely autobiographical account of how a French filmmaker was brought before the justice system for taping auditions of young actresses masturbating for his camera. On Thursday it's the local premiere of one of the most accomplished, elegant and exciting action films of the year, Johnnie To's Hong Kong gangster film, ''Exiled,'' in which two gangs of Triad hoodlums cross swords over the lucrative Macau market. (Through Feb. 27.) Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. LILY ALLEN (Tomorrow) A 21-year-old British singer who became a MySpace favorite with deceptively sweet, ska-infused pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her best putting down exes and disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' is a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got to go 'cause my house is on fire. I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario) APPLES IN STEREO (Thursday) This Denver band made a splash in the mid-'90s with power-pop songs in loud primary colors, like the Beach Boys reborn as a New Wave act. After five years of silence, they have a new album, ''New Magnetic Wonder,'' released by the actor Elijah Wood's record label, Simian. It makes one thing clear: it wasn't really the Beach Boys or the Beatles that Apples in Stereo was emulating all those years; it was Electric Light Orchestra. With Casper and the Cookies, and Cause Commotion. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) * ARCADE FIRE (Tuesday through Thursday) Three years ago, with its jubilantly clamorous album ''Funeral,'' this guitars, violins and accordion collective from Montreal performed a kind of musical miracle: making navel-gazing indie-rock seem not only fresh and sincere but also deeply meaningful. Its brilliant second record, ''Neon Bible'' (Merge), to be released next month, is darker and more preoccupied but nearly as cathartic, and next week the band begins a five-night stand at the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village. At 7:30 p.m., 55 Washington Square South, (212) 260-4700, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) DAVID BROMBERG (Tuesday) Mr. Bromberg can play just about anything with strings -- guitar, dobro, mandolin, fiddle -- and his knowledge of American music spans blues, bluegrass, country and rock. He also has a gift for elaborate verbal riffs that turn his long-suffering blues into comedy. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Jon Pareles) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) This ageless queen of genteel piano bar jazz plays everything from Sondheim to Monk with grace and authority. She sings too. Her rendition of ''Old Friends,'' from ''Merrily We Roll Along,'' will bring tears to your eyes. At 2 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58, with brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) JUDY COLLINS (Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Collins, a folk songbird for seemingly longer than anybody else has been a folk songbird, begins a three-week cabaret engagement at the Café Carlyle. At 8:45 p.m., Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $100 cover at tables, $65 at the bar. (Sisario) * 'CONCIERTO DEL AMOR' (Tomorrow) Someday all Valentine's Day music will be Latin pop, which revels in both the passionate and the treacly. This annual concert at Madison Square Garden features two salsa giants: Victor Manuelle, a leading young sonero, or improvising singer, who is not above dipping into reggaetón to score a hit, and Gilberto Santa Rosa, an unswerving traditionalist for three decades. Also on the bill are the great Latin jazz pianist Eddie Palmieri; Don Omar, a reggaetón star; the merengue regulars Elvis Crespo and Millie Quezada; and the Mexican pop duo Sin Bandera. At 8 p.m., (212) 307-7171 or (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $59.50 to $129.50. (Sisario) MARSHALL CRENSHAW (Wednesday) Mr. Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970s styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. With Matt Roach. At 8 p.m., the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Pareles) * PACO DE LUCÍA (Tomorrow and Sunday) One of the world's greatest guitarists, Mr. de Lucía is both a traditionalist and an adventurer, dipping into jazz and salsa but always retaining a solid grounding in flamenco. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; sold out. Sunday at 7 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $22 to $78 . (Sisario) * DIAMANDA GALÁS (Wednesday) Though she is invariably dressed in black, with her face in witchy streaks of makeup, Ms. Galás needs only her voice to terrify and seduce. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory; for two ''Valentine's Day Massacre'' sets, she will tear apart love songs by Peggy Lee, Marlene Dietrich, Chet Baker and Édith Piaf. At 6:30 and 9:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $20. (Sisario) GIRL TALK, PARTS AND LABOR (Tonight) Girl Talk is a Pittsburgh musician named Gregg Gillis who, when not on his computer job at a medical instrument company, makes a zany and frequently hilarious kind of short-attention-span dance-pop by stitching together brief samples from hit songs. He shares a bill with Parts and Labor, a squally Brooklyn three-piece that manages the tricky task of being both anarchic and anthemic. At 9, Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $15. (Sisario) * GYUTO MONKS (Sunday) The Gyuto monks of Tibet studied Buddhism and meditated for five centuries in their college in Lhasa before the Chinese invasion of 1959. One-tenth of the 900 monks followed the Dalai Lama into exile, and they re-established their monastery in India. They chant as they meditate with a technique that produces multiple overtones over their deep bass notes: an otherworldly sound that seeks to heal the world, punctuated by the clang of cymbals and the roar of long trumpets. At 7 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 545-7536, the-townhall-nyc.org or worldmusicinstitute.org; $35 and $40. (Pareles) HINDER (Tuesday) This Oklahoma band has little to distinguish it from the dozen or two other well-coiffed, heavily commercialized groups being pushed on hard-rock radio -- some day try a taste test of Hinder, Nickelback, Three Days Grace and Fuel -- except for its hit ''Lips of an Angel.'' An unfairly addictive power ballad about falling back in love with your ex (''My girl's in the next room/Sometimes I wish she was you''), it helped make Hinder's ''Extreme Behavior'' (Universal) the 10th-best-selling album of 2006. With Finger Eleven and Black Stone Cherry. At 7:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) KIKI AND HERB (Sunday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And some late-night gigs at Joe's Pub. And the annual, inimitable Christmas show. (Highlight: a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'') Kiki and Herb can't stay away from the stage, and New York is the better for it. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) LIFETIME (Tomorrow) In most ways, this New Jersey band was standard-issue 1990s hardcore punk, with lots of slashing guitars and angry, accusatory lyrics. But in a genre that is virtually uniform in sound as well as attitude, Lifetime stood out for slightly more attention to melody and a slightly more uplifting tone, and it became an important influence on emo. The band reunited recently after almost a decade, and just released a new, self-titled album on Decaydance, the label run by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy. With World/Inferno Friendship Society and Crime in Stereo. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Tonight and tomorrow night) Now in its ninth season, this series has greatly expanded from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like. Tonight features the 36-year-old theater composer Jason Robert Brown (''Parade,'' ''Urban Cowboy''), and tomorrow Betty Buckley is joined by Kenny Werner and Quintessence for some music that is actually a little underrepresented in this series: classics of the American songbook. Tonight at 8:30, tomorrow night at 8:30 and 10:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; sold out tonight, $40 to $90 tomorrow (8:30 show sold out). (Sisario) RAUL MALO ( Wednesday and Thursday) The leader of the Mavericks, Mr. Malo has never let himself be bound by the strictures of country. His music looks back to the 1950s and '60s with a clear-eyed nostalgia, and he has the soaring tenor voice of a dedicated Roy Orbison fan. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30 (Wednesday sold out). (Pareles) MIDLAKE (Tonight) This Texas quintet specializes in a lilting acoustic folk-rock sprinkled with soft piano and winds. With the Czars and St. Vincent. At 8:30, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) MOONEY SUZUKI (Thursday) One of the sharpest and loudest garage-rock bands in town -- in sound as well as in dress -- Mooney Suzuki draws on the frantic energy of mid-'60s British mod groups like the Who, as well as on the bruising blues-rock of Led Zeppelin. With General & Majors and Johan. At 8:30 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) SHIYANI NGCOBO (Tonight) Making his American debut, this singer and guitarist is a master of maskanda, a Zulu folk style in South Africa that relies on virtuosic guitar picking and arrangements of fiddle and concertina that sound comfortingly country. At 8:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Sisario) STEVE RILEY AND THE MAMOU PLAYBOYS (Sunday) The accordionist Steve Riley leads one of the best bands from the Louisiana bayous. It reaches back to some of the oldest Cajun tunes and can play them in traditional style, but it's not afraid of swamp-rock or a touch of country, either, and this weekend comes to New York for a Mardi Gras show. At 7:30 p.m., with a free zydeco dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597 or (212) 597-5126, letszydeco.com; $22. (Pareles) SLAYER (Thursday) One of the architects of modern heavy metal, Slayer emerged in the early 1980s with a hellish, claustrophobic sound -- all foreboding skies and tormented vocals, delivered at whip-crack speeds -- and has stuck steadfastly to it. With Unearth. At 7:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; sold out. (Sisario) ROD STEWART (Wednesday) His four Great American Songbook albums may not represent the most distinguished readings of those songs -- ditto his Bob Seger and Creedence Clearwater Revival covers on the recent ''Still the Same Great Rock Classics of Our Time'' (J) -- but when Rod Stewart lets go of his smugness, that whisky tenor of his can be a powerful interpretive instrument. Doesn't happen often, though. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-7171 or (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $55 to $129.50. (Sisario) VETIVER, VASHTI BUNYAN (Tomorrow) Last weekend Ms. Bunyan, an obscure light in the 1960s British folk scene with an impossibly fragile voice, and Vetiver, a hushed neofolk band that is one of the inheritors of her tradition, played at Carnegie Hall as part of David Byrne's Perspectives series. Their small sound was somewhat dwarfed by the place, but this gig, at Southpaw in Brooklyn, is more their size. At 9 p.m., 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Chinen) TODD SICKAFOOSE AND JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight) Mr. Sickafoose, a bassist, and Ms. Scheinman, a violinist, share an attraction to streamlined harmonic progressions and texture-conscious grooves. Their rhythm section here consists of Mike Gamble on guitar and Ches Smith on drums. At 10, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) JANIS SIEGEL (Wednesday) On ''A Thousand Beautiful Things'' (Telarc), Ms. Siegel explores the same brand of popular eclecticism she enjoys in Manhattan Transfer, but in a way that's a few degrees less cloying. She has good company on Valentine's Day: Edsel Gomez on piano, Edmar Castaneda on harp, Ben Street on bass and Steve Hass on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum.

STRICKLAND QUINTET (Thursday) The drummer E. J. Strickland -- like his brother Marcus, who joins him here on tenor saxophone -- hails from a generation fluent in jazz conventions but not beholden to them. The alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, the pianist Luis Perdomo and the bassist Hans Glawischnig round out his quintet. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12. (Chinen) TIERNEY SUTTON (Tuesday) With her new album, ''On the Other Side'' (Telarc), Ms. Sutton applies her pristine vocal style to a bouquet of songs about happiness or unhappiness in love. Her emotional oscillation is purposeful, sometimes transparently so: the Harold Arlen tune ''Get Happy'' appears first as a puzzling dirge and then, more convincingly, as a fizzy delight. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen) YOSVANY TERRY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Terry, a dynamic saxophonist and percussionist, chases post-bop ideals without abandoning the pull of his native Cuba. For his ''Afro Cuban Roots,'' a new piece inspired by Yoruban cultural traditions, he features the accomplished batá drummer Orlando (Puntilla) Rios and the dancer Felix (Pupi) Insua, along with an ensemble that includes Osmany Paredes on piano and Yunior Terry, Mr. Terry's brother, on bass.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' (Tomorrow) Salvatore Licitra again plays iron-man tenor, singing both ends of this beloved double-header. Dolora Zajick and Krassimira Stoyanova are the noteworthy sopranos. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Bernard Holland) * 'EUGENE ONEGIN' (Tonight and Tuesday night) For her first Met performances in the Russian role of Tatiana, the impressionable heroine of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' the soprano Renée Fleming will be inspired, no doubt, and possibly a little daunted by her Russian colleagues in this revival of Robert Carsen's 1997 production. The baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky sings Onegin, a role he seems born to portray, and Valery Gergiev will conduct. The Mexican-born tenor Ramón Vargas sings Lenski. This looks to be a highlight of the season. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'JENUFA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The charismatic Finnish soprano Karita Mattila is riveting in the title role of Janacek's grim, insightful and, by the end, consoling Czech opera ''Jenufa,'' the Met's revival of its 2003 production. Ms. Mattila's gleaming voice, with its cool Nordic colorings, and vibrant sensuality are ideal for this character, a foolishly trusting young woman in a Moravian village who has become pregnant by her cousin, the town rake who owns the local mill. The ageless German soprano Anja Silja is at once terrifying and pitiable as Jenufa's stern stepmother, Kostelnicka. Jiri Belohlavek conducts a sensitive and sweeping account of Janacek's teeming score, presented in its 1908 version. (The mezzo-soprano Judith Forst sings Kostelnicka in tomorrow evening's performance.) At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini) 'I PURITANI' (Thursday) The reason the Met dusted off its stodgy, old 1976 production of Bellini's ''Puritani'' was to present the glamorous and brilliant soprano Anna Netrebko as Elvira. For the final performance on Thursday, the admirable soprano Elizabeth Futral takes over for Ms. Netrebko, not an enviable assignment. Still, Ms. Futral is an impressive vocalist and an exciting interpreter of the Bel Canto repertory. She made her 1999 Met debut in the title role of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' and recently created the role of Princess Yueyang in Tan Dun's ''First Emperor.'' At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Monday) For its revival of Verdi's ''Traviata,'' in Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production, the Met is rotating casts, with three sopranos sharing the role of Violetta this season. Mary Dunleavy, who made her company debut in 1993, takes over the role on Monday night, with the tenor José Luis Duval as Alfredo, and the baritone Charles Taylor as Germont. Carlo Rizzi conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini) Classical Music AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Leon Botstein's latest interesting program looks at conductors who compose, including George Szell, Paul Kletzki, Harold Farberman and Leonard Bernstein.

(Holland) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) Tonight on the barge, the pianist Jonathan Irving plays Schubert Impromptus and the Sonata in A minor (D. 784). Tomorrow and Sunday the DaPonte String Quartet plays Beethoven's Quartet in F (Op. 135), Gershwin's ''Lullaby'' and Wolf's ''Italian Serenade.'' The program concludes with Dvorak's Quintet for Piano and Strings in A (Op. 81), for which the quartet will be joined by Michael Kimmelman, a pianist and chief art critic (and a former music critic) of The New York Times. On Valentine's Day -- champagne and chocolates included -- the pianist Steven Beck plays Liszt, Chopin and Beethoven, and on Thursday, the program includes piano trios by Brahms and Beethoven. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m.; and Wednesday at 7 p.m., Fulton Ferry landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35 tonight and Thursday, $40 tomorrow and Sunday, $50 on Wednesday. (Vivien Schweitzer) * BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) Not quite an oratorio, nearly an opera, Berlioz's ''Damnation de Faust'' skips back and forth between the opera house and the concert hall, and more and more frequently, it seems, in recent years. The nonstaged option allows the listener a novel-reader's freedom of imagination and perhaps a deeper immersion in the colors of the score, probably mined deeply in the reading of James Levine. Heading his cast is the veteran bass-baritone José van Dam as Mephistopheles. Yvonne Naef, Paul Groves and Andrew Gangestad are the other accomplished soloists, backed up by the Tanglewood Festival Chorus. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $39 to $127. (Anne Midgette) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) For what it is calling its Winter Festival, the Chamber Music Society is exploring English music, with an emphasis on works composed between 1900 and 1930. On Sunday the ensemble begins a bit earlier, with a Fantasia by Purcell, and then offers music by Vaughan Williams, Bliss and Warlock. The centerpiece on Tuesday is the Vaughan Williams song cycle ''On Wenlock Edge,'' to be sung by Russell Thomas, the tenor, on a program that also includes works by Goossens, Ireland and Bax. Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Allan Kozinn) * CONTINUUM (Tuesday) The Israel Philharmonic recently played two concerts in New York without offering music by a single Israeli composer. For that, you have to turn to Continuum, which is looking at Israeli music, with an emphasis on works by immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The composers represented include Josef Bardanashvili, Michael Liebman, Benjamin Yusupov, Uri Brener, Valentin Bibik and Hana Ajiashvili. At 8 p.m., the J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (646) 505-5708, continuum-ensemble-ny.org; $15. (Kozinn) PHILIP GLASS AND WENDY SUTTER (Tuesday) As part of the Baryshnikov Arts Center's Movado Hour series of free, informal concerts, the composer and pianist Philip Glass and the cellist Wendy Sutter are collaborating on a program of Mr. Glass's music, including the premiere of his ''Songs and Poems'' for cello.

(Kozinn) HUNGARIAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) Welcome to the brave new world of arts sponsorship in the ex-East Bloc: while on this 100-year-old orchestra's first United States tour, its conductor announced during a concert that the ensemble had lost its main sponsor and would be dissolving. (Distressed spinmeisters countered that it would only be shrinking into a chamber ensemble.) So tomorrow may be both a first and a last chance for New Yorkers to hear this particular survivor of Central European tradition in Liszt's Second Piano Concerto (with Paavali Jumppanen), Dvorak's mighty Eighth Symphony and Mussorgsky's ''Night on Bald Mountain.'' At 8 p.m., Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100, tillescenter.org; $48 to $90; $3 off for 65+. (Midgette) * JOHANNES STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The members of this acclaimed quartet make time in their busy outside careers to perform together. Peter Stumpf is the principal cellist of the Los Angles Philharmonic, and C. J. Chang is the principal violist of the Philadelphia Orchestra. The violinists are both based in New York: Soovin Kim, the first American to win the Paganini Violin Competition in 24 years, and Jessica Lee, who won the 2005 Concert Artists Guild International Competition. Music lovers can hear them at a bargain price tomorrow when the essential Peoples' Symphony Concerts presents the quartet in works by Beethoven, Schubert and Mozart. At 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9. (Tommasini) JENNIFER KOH (Wednesday) The dynamic violinist Jennifer Koh, who has proven her mettle in repertory from Bach to Ligeti, is a vigorous champion of new music. On Wednesday she will perform the New York premiere of Jennifer Higdon's ''String Poetic,'' which was written for Ms. Koh and the pianist Reiko Uchida, her frequent collaborator. The lively program also includes Janacek's Sonata, Schubert's Sonatina in D and Schumann's Sonata No. 2. Ms. Koh will also perform excerpts from Kurtag's ''Signs, Games and Messages.'' At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40; $25 for age 35 and under. (Schweitzer) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM ARTISTS IN CONCERT (Tonight) The Metropolitan Museum's resident chamber group -- Andrew Armstrong, pianist; Colin Jacobsen and Yosuke Kawasaki, violinists; Nicholas Cords, violist; and Edward Arron and Raman Ramakrishnan, cellists -- opens its season with an eclectic program. Included are a Purcell Fantasia, a Boccherini String Quintet, the Brahms F minor Piano Quintet and a recent work, ''Viaggio in Italia,'' by the Italian post-Minimalist Giovanni Sollima. At 8, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $30. (Kozinn) * MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Finnish conductor Osmo Vanska has helped make the Minnesota Orchestra one of the most compelling in America right now, not least with a vivid Beethoven symphony cycle on CD that's satisfying, fresh, and continuing. (Symphonies 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 have all been released.) Beethoven's delightful and underplayed Fourth Symphony and his classic Fifth feature on consecutive nights in concerts that balance them against the fourth and fifth symphonies of Mr. Vanska's compatriot Jean Sibelius. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $88 (Midgette) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Piano fans, rejoice. This weekend offers a chance to hear the conductor Alan Gilbert, whose sobriquet is morphing from ''rising'' to simply ''hot,'' in Debussy's ''Images''; a piece called ''Parodos'' by Daniel Börtz, a Swedish composer; and Beethoven's first piano concerto with the soloist Lars Vogt. Next week, Lorin Maazel leads off the orchestra's Brahms festival with the Serenade No. 1 and the first piano concerto as played by Emanuel Ax. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $99. (Midgette) ORCHESTRA OF ST.

Built in 1996 in a style similar to those of north Germany and the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries, St. Thomas's Taylor & Boody organ is ideal for such a venture. At 4 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013; saintthomaschurch.org; free. (Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * BIG DANCE THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow) Annie-B Parsons and Paul Lazar, Big's wildly imaginative choreographer and director, explore the stories of the contemporary novelist Masuji Ibuse just in time for the start of Japan Society's celebration of its yearlong centennial.

(Dunning) DanceBrazil (Tuesday through Thursday) Jelon Vieira, the artistic director of this vibrant company from Bahia, has been particularly successful at fusing the techniques of capoeira, the Afro-Brazilian martial art, with modern dance forms. To celebrate the company's 30th anniversary, he has created a new work, ''The Ritual of the Roda,'' that traces the history of capoeira; the kickboxing fireworks artfully transformed into dance should be well worth seeing. (Through Feb. 18.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42; Joyce members, $32.

(Dunning) * D D DORVILLIER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Dorvillier describes her new ''Nottthing Is Importanttt'' as a cinema performance, incorporating video and a ''dark and sound environment.''

(Dunning) Alex Escalante (Thursday) A new trio, ''Swallow Sand,'' by Mr. Escalante, has a live score by Jon Moniaci. According to press materials, the piece features an installation of hundreds of copper tin cans and ''investigates social desensitization bought on by a hyper frenetic environment.''

(Dunning) Regina Nejman & Company (Thursday) Ms. Nejman's new ''Frozen Baby'' is described as a ''dance installation,'' which might indicate that there won't be too much dancing. But Ms. Nejman is a choreographer who revels in sheer physicality, and there should be plenty of high-energy movement to watch. The work is set to commissioned music by Mio Morales, whose last score for Ms. Nejman was a compelling mix of Brazilian pop and sharp electronic rhythyms. (Through Feb. 18.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 334-7479; $20; $17 for students. (Sulcas) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Thursday) The company's marketers have devised snappy titles for 10 winter season repertory programs. But words appear to have failed them when it came to tonight's collection of ballets, repeated on Sunday and Thursday, which is rather dully called ''Contemporary Quartet.'' It consists of ''Carousel (A Dance),'' ''Intermezzo No. 1,'' ''Slice to Sharp'' and ''Friandises.'' No matter. We still have ''Balanchine and Robbins: Masters at Work'' (''Serenade,'' ''Dybbuk'' and ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto,'' tomorrow afternoon); ''Essential Balanchine'' (''Square Dance,'' ''Liebeslieder Waltzer'' and ''Stars and Stripes,'' tomorrow night); ''Visionary Voices'' (''Klavier,'' ''Russian Seasons'' and ''The Four Temperaments,'' on Tuesday) and ''For the Fun of It'' (''Circus Polka,'' ''Walpurgisnacht Ballet,'' ''Jeu de Cartes'' and ''Firebird,'' on Wednesday).

Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith) * Chelsea Art Museum: 'DANGEROUS BEAUTY,' through April 21. A timely update of a well-worn idea, this show of contemporary works in a variety of mediums by 18 artists examines the beauty myth in art, advertising and the fashion industry. Eloquent but blunt imagery of anorexic girls, chiseled male beefcake and close-ups of surgically deformed faces predominates, reminding us of the violent extremes to which some people will go in pursuit of society's ideal of beauty. The rest of the show -- often pointing an accusatory finger at skinny models, cosmetic labels and the mass media -- feels familiar in its critique, but the premise about the ideology of beauty is beyond argument. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719, chelseaartmuseum.org. (Benjamin Genocchio) * Grey Art Gallery: 'Semina Culture: Wallace Berman & His Circle,' through March 31. The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) may ring only a faint bell to many New Yorkers, but he was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780. (Holland Cotter) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Henri Cartier-Bresson's Scrapbook: Photographs, 1932-46,' through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It's an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. He became a celebrity in America. He photographed Fred Astaire dancing and Joan Crawford poolside. In the breezy layouts of Harper's Bazaar, the work looked brilliant. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. The 100 paintings and drawings on display here are by 10 artists, including George Grosz, Christian Schad and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble; we look into the faces of museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * The MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) Morgan Library & Museum: 'Private Treasures: Four Centuries of European Master Drawings,' through April 8. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The works span more than 400 years, from the 16th to the early 20th century, and include drawings in ink and pencil, watercolor, chalk and gouache. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn't an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one's craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example is a black chalk drawing, ''The Dead Christ'' (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don't know where they came from, where they're going or when you'll see them again. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Martha Schwendener) Storefront for Art and Architecture: 'Clip/Stamp/Fold,' through Feb. 24. This show examines the world of those small magazines from the early 1960s to the end of the 1970s, when the field of architecture was still marked by a playful intellectual and political independence. Often thrown together on a shoestring budget, the magazines have an intoxicating freshness that should send a shudder down the spine of those who've spent the last decade in the glow of the computer screen. But this is not an exercise in nostalgia. It's a piercing critique, intended or not, of the smoothness of our contemporary design culture. These magazine covers map out an era when architecture was simmering with new ideas. You're bound to leave the show with a nagging sense of what was lost as well as gained during the last three decades. 97 Kenmare Street, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) Galleries: Chelsea * JACCO OLIVIER Yet another painter working in animation might seem a little tiresome. But these wistful filmed animations of loosely brushed seascapes and landscapes by Mr. Olivier are perfectly lovely. It is no revelation that he is from the Netherlands -- Dutch artists more or less invented landscape imagery in the late 16th century. This artist updates the genr. The imagery is marvelously painterly, with the individual frames sometimes bordering on abstraction, though the narrative structure owes much to the techniques of film. Mr. Olivier's peculiar genius is to have effortlessly combined them. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street, (212) 680-9889, www.marianneboeskygallery.com, through Feb. 17. (Genocchio) Last Chance * COSMOLOGIES This flawed but also irresistible survey of the longstanding human desire to account for the universe in a holistic, often holy manner ranges eclectically across continents, centuries, mediums and religions. Its nearly 70 objects and artworks include African ritual objects, Tibetan and Mongolian mandalas, rare European prints and books and the efforts of over 30 contemporary artists. Unsurprisingly, the circle is the dominant form here, which befits the way you may find yourself orbiting through the panoply of material. James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 714-9500; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * Freeman/Phelan: 'The Long Goodbye' As a collaborative duo, Jonah Freeman and Michael Phelan turn the American cultural landscape into a kind of job lot shop of the damned. Synthetic carpeting heaves across the gallery floor. Glass display cases display only themselves. Pictures that look abstract and a little Chinese-y are actually photographs of aluminum foil. Some interesting young artists are turning design into a lethal critical weapon, and Mr. Freeman and Mr. Phelan are two of them. Josh Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9563, johnconnellypresents.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * 'Material for the Making' This auspicious first show organized by Elizabeth Dee's new director, Jenny Moore, has work by four good artists. Mai Brau's heap of shredded newspaper is a realistically undecipherable edition of the news of the day. Gail Thacker's sequential Polaroids of a dancing man covered in shaving cream is Dada Eadweard Muybridge. Kori Newkirk fills a wall with a giant snowflake painted in pomade. An eerie video by Kerry Tribe recreates, in sonambulistic shock-time, the experience of a car accident in a snow storm. Elizabeth Dee, 545 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 942-7545, elizabethdeegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * CARRIE MOYER: THE STONE AGE, NEW PAINTINGS Although a little cautious, Ms. Moyer's new paintings have a bracing visual and conceptual complexity. Feminism, biology, geology, prehistoric goddesses and vessels are evoked in thin, precisely calibrated layers that add new twists to both the geometry and the gesturalism of male-dominated formalist painting. It's post-political abstraction. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * Museum of Modern Art: 'DOUG AITKEN: SLEEPWALKERS' Produced in concert with Creative Time Inc., this monumental video projection, screened nightly (from 5 to 10) on three sides of the sleek exterior of the newly expanded Museum of Modern Art, consists of short, silent and rather too glamorous meditations on the working nights of five emblematic New Yorkers played somnolently by actors and musicians who include Donald Sutherland and Tilda Swinton. But Mr. Aitken's astute and restless cinematic ambition and commanding sense of scale are in full force, especially in the more abstract portions of the piece, resulting in a fitting ode to the city that never sleeps and that the camera has always loved. (212) 708-9400; closes on Monday. (Smith) * Stephen G. Rhodes: 'Recurrency' It's great when someone gets ambitiously complicated and makes it work, as the young Los Angeles-based artist Stephen G. Rhodes does in his first solo show. Formally, he juggles video, sculpture, photographs and drawings, and hooks them up in a circling narrative that ricochets from 19th-century fiction to B films to Hurricane Katrina. The play of history, fiction and recent reality that results is memorably atmospheric. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224, www.guildgreyshkul.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Saul Steinberg: works from the 50's-80's Steinberg's side-winding art may be in full cry at the Morgan Library, but this wonderful short-form retrospective doesn't skimp. Ranging from the early 1950s to the late 1980s, its 40 objects include one of the artist's studio-table sculptures, accoutered with whittled versions of tools and works-in-progress and a facsimile of his many notebooks that feels like the real thing, especially since it can be handled. Adam Baumgold Gallery, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005' Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)

VA man who taught seminars about whales to elementary school students was arrested last week and charged with possession of child pornography, the state police said. The man, Stuart Goldman, 63, was arrested on Friday after the state police found pornographic images on his computer, said Sgt. Stephen Jones, a spokesman. The computer was seized last March when the state police charged Mr. Goldman with having marijuana plants in his house in Barrington, Sergeant Jones said. Mr. Goldman has pleaded not guilty to the drug charges, the state police said.

The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. 'MARY ROSE' In previews; opens on Tuesday. Although it can sometimes seem otherwise, J. M.

Eric Bogosian's darkly funny portrait of a late-night talk show host returns for a Broadway revival starring Liev Schreiber. Robert Falls directs. Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in rural Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THAT I WILL EVER BE' In this false-feeling comedy-drama by Alan Ball, creator of ''Six Feet Under,'' a gay hustler undergoes an identity crisis when he finds himself falling for one of his clients. Slick but mostly stale in its analysis of a society afraid of emotional engagement (2:15). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'THE CRYING WOMAN' An imaginative play that manages to transform what begins as a tired culture-clash comedy involving a Mexican and United States couple sharing a house in Mexico City into a sinister tale involving strange superstitions and a ghost from the 16th century (2:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton) 'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DUTCHMAN' A revival of the poet Amiri Baraka's screed on race and American values, 43 years after its Greenwich Village debut, aims for all the fire and might of a Malcolm X speech but none of the rhetorical elegance. It shouts so loudly that you can't hear a thing (1:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE FEVER' Wallace Shawn performs his provocative monologue about a guilt-riddled bourgeois everyman sweating his way through a moral crisis. The rich, often hypnotic writing draws us into his tortured mindscape, as he shifts between shame over his sense of entitlement and reasoned arguments that sacrifice is unnecessary and pointless. Meanwhile, in the third world, the violence and poverty continue unabated (1:30). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'THE FRUGAL REPAST' This sweet, compact story by Ron Hirsen dabbles in the high concepts of art, but not too deeply, which makes it just right. Two circus performers see Picasso's ''Frugal Repast'' in a dealer's window and realize they were the models for it; when they steal the print, their lowbrow world and Picasso's highbrow one amusingly collide (1:20). The June Havoc Theater, Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances, and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE JADED ASSASSIN' Imagine mediocre professional wrestling mixed with ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' and you get the idea (1:15). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'THE LAST WORD ' Oren Safdie's comedy about cultural generation gaps amuses as it goes along but lands at a predictable nowhere. Daniel J. Travanti stars as a Viennese Jew and aspiring playwright who does battle with a young student angling to become his writing assistant and find his voice (1:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' and 'THE JEW OF MALTA' F. Murray Abraham plays two Elizabethan villains in repertory for the Theater for a New Audience. Mr. Abraham's sinister but still moving Shylock is the dark heart of Darko Tresnjak's chilly, powerful staging of one of Shakespeare's unfunniest comedies. As Barabas in David Herskovits's goofy, postmodern ''Jew of Malta,'' he's the lively center of a carnival that doesn't do justice to Christopher Marlowe's harsh satire on Christian hypocrisy and venality (each 2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' Shakespeare's comedy, so dependent on things that aren't what they appear to be, makes an inspired choice for Theater by the Blind, a group that mixes blind, vision-impaired and fully sighted actors. The most intriguing thing, though, is how the company stages the play with just six actors (1:50). The Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'A SPANISH PLAY' The great Zoe Caldwell returns to the New York stage after an absence of a decade, in the fine company of Linda Emond, Denis O'Hare and Larry Pine. That's the good news. The bad? The play. Yasmina Reza's pseudo-philosophical and metatheatrical trifle is utterly forgettable (1:50). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'VICTORIA MARTIN: MATH TEAM QUEEN' Must all stage teenagers speak in that exaggerated surfer-dude style in which ''awesome'' and ''totally'' make up about 50 percent of any conversation? Yes, apparently they must, from the evidence presented in this thin comedy, which is about a high school girl who finds herself on the all-male math team. The playwright, Kathryn Walat, seems to have been trying to grab the coattails of a certain spelling-bee-related show. She missed (2:00). The Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100.

(Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ANON.' Kate Robin's savvy, dark romantic comedy about sexual addiction doesn't live up to its potential (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Gates) 'FRANK'S HOME' Peter Weller plays Frank Lloyd Wright in Richard Nelson's dreary bio-drama, which lingers lovingly on its subject's feet of clay while paying arid lip service to his genius (1:45). Playwrights Horizons Mainstage, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 719-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closes on Sunday. (Gates) * 'TOYS IN THE ATTIC' Austin Pendleton's fine revival of Lillian Hellman's last play faithfully attacks the corrosive attachments of family. What good is a family, and thus a society, the play implicitly asks, that can only look in the mirror? (2:30) Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES' (PG, 94 minutes) Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy (Freddie Highmore) who shrinks to microscopic size to find some gems and his missing grandfather. Lots of famous names (Madonna, Robert De Niro, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg) lend their voices to the computerized part of the movie, but only briefly near the end does everything click. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott) 'BECAUSE I SAID SO' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore as mother and daughter. What did she say, exactly? Whatever it was, it wasn't as funny as it should have been. (Scott) * 'BLACK FRIDAY' (No rating, 143 minutes, in Hindi) Set in 1993, this is an exploration of how religious hatred between India's Hindu majority and Muslim minority manifested itself in institutionalized discrimination, race rioting and, ultimately, a series of terrorist bombings by Muslim guerrillas that killed 257 people in Mumbai. The upshot is an exhaustive, exhausting, often moving thriller that spreads both empathy and condemnation around democratically. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis) 'BREAKING AND ENTERING' (R, 119 minutes) This high-toned, feel-bad exercise in liberal guilt comes from Anthony Minghella, who brings the same earnest humorlessness to present-day London that he has brought to the historical past. Jude Law is an architect; Juliette Binoche is a Bosnian seamstress; and Vera Farmiga provides a glimmer of wit and liveliness as a Russian prostitute who shows up to drink coffee, show her underwear and discuss the themes of the movie. (Scott) * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superb thriller directed by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others. (Dargis) * 'DAYS OF GLORY' (R, 120 minutes, in French) Rachid Bouchareb's tale of North African soldiers fighting to free their French colonial masters from German Occupation during World War II is a potent combat picture, and also a searching and complex political drama. (Scott) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'EPIC MOVIE' (PG-13, 86 minutes) A cheap, dumb parody of expensive, dumb movies. (Scott) 'FACTORY GIRL' (R, 91 minutes) It's not entirely inappropriate that this film, George Hickenlooper's biography of Edie Sedgwick, the most glamorous of Andy Warhol's so-called superstars, should suggest a magazine layout masquerading as a film. The world through which Ms. Sedgwick (Sienna Miller) blazed and burned out was one that lived and died by the camera. It existed to be seen and drooled over. But God help you if you actually lived in it. (Stephen Holden) 'HANNIBAL RISING' (R, 121 minutes) Marked by too much respect and too little energy, this primer on the early years of Hannibal Lecter reduces one of our most mythic villains to a callow, dysfunctional chef. Orphaned in World War II, our psychopathic hero hunts down his family's killers and snacks on their remains. But burrowing into the id of pop culture's most repulsive gourmet demands a sanguinary glee that the director, Peter Webber, may not possess; for all the movie's spurting gore, there's no accompanying rush of blood to the head. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'THE ITALIAN' (PG-13, 99 minutes, in Russian) This dark fairy tale from Russia pulls you into a richly atmospheric, persuasively inhabited world teeming with young foundlings and pathos, and upended by one remarkable little boy. (Dargis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS' (R, 137 minutes, in German) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature takes place in East Berlin in 1984, and it is a smart, moving inquiry into the moral predicament facing good people in a bad system. Ulrich Mühe's performance as a conscience-stricken Stasi officer is a tightly wound tour de force, and Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are both superb as a playwright and his actress lover who are drawn into the cruel, absurd clutches of the Communist secret police. (Scott) * 'MAFIOSO' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Italian) This 1962 film, revived by Rialto Pictures, is a rambunctious, astonishing blend of farce, thriller and social satire. The director, Alberto Lattuada, follows an up-and-coming Fiat manager (Alberto Sordi) on a visit from Milan to his native village in Sicily. His homecoming is full of surprises -- painful for him, altogether delightful for the audience. (Scott) 'NORBIT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Eddie Murphy plays a nebbish, a fat woman and a Chinese restaurant owner in this crude, sometimes mean, but often funny farce. (Scott) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zoë Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) 'NOTES ON MARIE MENKEN' (No rating, 97 minutes) Martina Kudlacek's documentary shines a quavering if welcome ray of light on a largely forgotten figure in the American avant-garde film scene, whose sphere of influence included Edward Albee, Stan Brakhage and Kenneth Anger. (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) 'PUCCINI FOR BEGINNERS' (No rating, 81 minutes) Snappy repartee with the ring of real conversation among people who are never at a loss for a remark is something every self-respecting Manhattan sophisticate imagines can be channeled into a screenplay with the crackle of vintage Woody Allen. That elusive tone is sustained through enough of Maria Maggenti's film ''Puccini For Beginners'' to make this screwball comedy of sexual confusion with lesbian inclinations a rarity. (Holden) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) * 'REGULAR LOVERS' (No rating, 175 minutes, in French) Philippe Garrel's tender portrait of late-1960s French youth stars the filmmaker's son, Louis Garrel, as a 20-year-old Parisian struggling through the fires of revolutionary promise and its smoldering remains. Magnificent. (Dargis) 'THE SITUATION' (No rating, 106 minutes, in English and Arabic) Connie Nielsen stars as a correspondent sniffing around wartime Iraq in a narcoleptic thriller directed by Philip Haas from a screenplay by the journalist Wendell Steavenson. (Dargis) 'SMOKIN' ACES' (R, 107 minutes) Absolute garbage. (Scott) 'STOMP THE YARD' (PG-13, 109 minutes) Brotherhood is powerful in this sometimes compelling, sometimes complacent movie about stepping and African-American fraternity life at an Atlanta institution called Truth University. D J (Columbus Short), a street-style dancer, needs to find his place in a university ruled by Gammas and Thetas and stepping. (Rachel Saltz) 'AN UNREASONABLE MAN' (No rating, 122 minutes) A very reasonable documentary about the long career of Ralph Nader as a consumer advocate and, more recently and vexingly to some of his former admirers, a perennial presidential candidate. (Scott) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) Film Series FILM COMMENT SELECTS (Tonight through Thursday) A series of critically acclaimed films that were not released commercially, chosen by the editors of Film Comment, continues tonight with Pedro Costa's ''Colossal Youth,'' one of the most divisive titles of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. A slow-moving study of the immigrants from Cape Verde who live in a run-down corner of Lisbon, the film evoked both the standard comparisons to paint drying and high praise comparing Mr. Costa's work to that of the avant garde masters Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet (whose final film will be shown in this series next weekend). Also this week: ''Bardo'' (2005), by the Taiwanese director Lin Tay-jou; the controversial Chinese film ''Summer Palace'' (2006), by Lou Ye; and a new, arty thriller, ''Retribution,'' (2006), by the Japanese filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa. (Through Feb. 27.) Walter Reade Theater 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) FIST AND SWORD: AN AFTERNOON WITH RON VAN CLIEF (Sunday) This African-American martial arts star appears with a program of clips from the many films and television programs he has worked on since 1974, including ''Way of the Black Dragon'' (1978) and ''Touch of Death'' (1980). Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) GRAHAM GREENE NOIR (Thursday) A series of four weekly screenings of films based on thrillers by Graham Greene begins with a rarely seen 1944 film by Fritz Lang, ''Ministry of Fear,'' a spy tale loosely based on Greene's novel of the same title, filled out with haunting, surrealist imagery. Ray Milland and Marjorie Reynolds star. (Through March 30.) Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Street, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, www.bam.org; $10. (Kehr) MORRICONE (Tonight through Thursday) The third and final week of a tribute to the Italian film composer Ennio Morricone features some very rare titles, including Giuliano Montaldo's 1968 ''Machine Gun McCain,'' starring John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk, on Sunday and Monday, and Samuel Fuller's fatally misunderstood fable on race relations, ''White Dog'' (1982), on Tuesday. Film Forum 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $10.50. (Kehr) A VIEW FROM THE VAULTS: WARNER BROs., RKO PICTURES AND FIRST NATIONAL PICTURES (Tonight through Thursday) Ten features from the aforementioned studios, shown in prints recently acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. This week's screenings include Irving Rapper's 1945 ''The Corn Is Green,'' with Bette Davis; Michael Curtiz's lurid 1949 carnival melodrama, ''Flamingo Road,'' with Joan Crawford; Raoul Walsh's 1940 tale of high-speed truck drivers, ''They Drive by Night''; and ''Gunga Din,'' George Stevens's rousing colonialist adventure of 1939. (Through Feb. 24.) Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. JON ANDERSON AND THE SCHOOL OF ROCK ALL-STARS (Sunday and Monday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Paul Green offers an extensive curriculum at his Philadelphia school, teaching youngsters the rock 'n' roll canon, as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. Here his students get the equivalent of a dissertation defense: backing up Jon Anderson, the helium-voiced former singer of Yes, in that band's hair-pullingly complex, neoclassical prog-rock songs. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $40 at the door (sold out on Sunday). (Ben Sisario) * ARCADE FIRE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Three years ago, with its jubilantly clamorous album ''Funeral,'' this Montreal group performed a kind of musical miracle: making navel-gazing indie-rock seem not only fresh and sincere but also deeply meaningful. Its brilliant second record, ''Neon Bible'' (Merge), to be released next month, is darker and more preoccupied but nearly as cathartic. At 7:30, Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 260-4700, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) BARR (Tonight and tomorrow night) Over bare stutters of piano and drums, Brendan Fowler of Barr lets loose an endlessly self-regarding logorrhea, questioning his every thought and instinct in a naked, paratactic melancholy. ''What is the saddest thing I can say?'' he asks on Barr's new album, ''Summary'' (5RC). ''Words aren't sad enough. Music isn't sad enough. How could it bear to be? It doesn't need to be 'cause life is there to do it for real.'' With Lucky Dragons. At 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; $10. (Sisario) RICHARD BUCKNER (Tomorrow and Sunday) With a dry baritone and a creaky acoustic guitar, Richard Buckner broods about women, booze and death. And he's serious about all this American Gothic stuff: his 2000 album ''The Hill'' was an appropriately bleak setting of 18 poems from Edgar Lee Masters's ''Spoon River Anthology.'' With Six Parts Seven. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 9:30 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $10. (Sisario) JUDY COLLINS (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) A folk songbird for seemingly longer than anybody else has been a folk songbird, Ms. Collins is at the Café Carlyle for her debut cabaret engagement. At 8:45 p.m., Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $100 cover at tables, $65 at the bar. (Sisario) BOBBY CONN (Thursday) Bobby Conn is a wiseguy iconoclast from Chicago who never skips his daily dose of irony as he turns pop songs into excursions all over the musical landscape. He wanders amid retro-funk, jazz and noise as he proclaims his romantic intentions in sardonically overwrought vocals. With Detholz and the Victoria Lucas. At 9 p.m., Trash Bar, 256 Grand Street, at Roebling Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn (718) 599-100, thetrashbar.com; $10. (Sisario) KEVIN DEVINE, JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Tomorrow) Mr. Devine, once of the band Miracle of 86, has carved out a niche as a sharp and unassuming singer-songwriter in the Elliott Smith mold. Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn, in poker-faced, half-sung, half-spoken vocals, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' With Pablo and Koufax. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario) DUB TRIO (Monday and Tuesday) Made up of well-traveled session players for the likes of the Fugees and Mos Def, Dub Trio plays spacious reggae grooves spiked with high-adrenaline punk, affectionately recalling Bad Brains. At 8 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484; $5. (Sisario) EXPLOSIONS IN THE SKY (Monday and Tuesday) The epic instrumentals by this band from Austin, Tex., begin in peace, with single notes twinkling amid darkness, and gradually build to turbulent vortexes of noise. Borrowing a few tricks from Pink Floyd, Explosions in the Sky keeps the pace majestic and the vistas cinematic, and takes its time. Monday at 9 p.m., with Mountains, at Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, wordlessmusic.org; both shows sold out. (Sisario) MELISSA FERRICK, TIM FITE (Tonight) Somewhere between Ani DiFranco and Melissa Etheridge, Ms. Ferrick slings an acoustic guitar and belts songs filled with bravado. Tim Fite's songs about ''kicking every can in New York City'' are booby-trapped with quick changes, from clean country-pop to corrosive punk. At 9, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $18. (Sisario) GANG GANG DANCE (Tomorrow) Like radio waves converging somewhere in outer space, this New York group's music -- made from tribal rhythms, pulsating electronic noises and Bollywoodesque vocals -- is a tangle of disparate sounds that seem slightly out of sync but in time develop their own hypnotic patterns. At 9 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $12.50. (Sisario) GYM CLASS HEROES (Thursday) It was inevitable: emo rap. Gym Class Heroes, from Geneva, N.Y., were as obscure a hip-hop act as could be when they made ''Taxi Driver,'' which winkingly name-checks a Warped Tour's worth of emo bands. (''I took a cutie for a ride in my death cab. Before she left she made a dashboard confessional.'') By last summer, when they released ''New Friend Request,'' about MySpace etiquette, they were rubbing shoulders with all those groups -- on the Warped Tour, of course. With RX Bandits, P.O.S. and k-os. At 5:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) 'IN THE ATTIC' (Tuesday) It's good to be connected. Rachel Fuller, a British songwriter, presents this informal musical salon with her companion, a little-known guitarist named Pete Townshend. ''In the Attic'' is usually a live Web cast from Mr. Townshend's studio, but lately Ms. Fuller has been taking it on the road, and on Tuesday she and Mr. Townshend preside over a jam session with surprise guests. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; sold out. (Sisario) RICKIE LEE JONES (Tonight) With a new album, ''The Sermon on Exposition Boulevard'' (New West), that sets sayings by Jesus to raw, droney rock songs, Rickie Lee Jones, the beret-wearing neo-Beat with the girlish slur, offers yet another twist in a career full of odd turns. At 8, the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $49.50. (Sisario) KIKI AND HERB (Sunday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And some late-night gigs at Joe's Pub. And the annual, inimitable Christmas show. (Highlight: a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'') Kiki and Herb can't stay away from the stage, and New York is the better for it. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) B. B. KING (Thursday) With his latest guitar called Lucille, B. B. King can, on a good night, summon all the tribulation and joy and resilience of the blues. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $35 to $95. (Jon Pareles) LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Wednesday and Thursday) Now in its ninth season, this series has expanded greatly from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like. On Wednesday Ute Lemper, one of the few performers who can make cabaret seem dangerous, sings songs by Kurt Weill, Tom Waits and Van Morrison, as well as some of her own. Thursday is a triple bill of young New York songwriters who have long shared (small) stages together: Sasha Dobson, whose songs float on a breeze of bossa nova; Jesse Harris, who wrote ''Don't Know Why'' for his friend Norah Jones; and Richard Julian, who is endlessly enamored of, and frustrated by, his most frequent subject, New York. At 8:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $60 (sold out on Wednesday). (Sisario) MALAJUBE, SNOWDEN (Tomorrow through Monday) Trading places as the headliner in three shows: Malajube, a Montreal band whose seductively surreal songs (sung in French) riffle through decades of influence, from happy Beatles pop to rap and stomping grunge-pop; and Snowden, whose members are from Atlanta but play stylishly depressive postpunk riffs like true Brooklynites. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. Monday at 8:30 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $10. (Sisario) PELA, HIGH STRUNG (Tonight) All Friday nights at the Mercury Lounge should be like this, and many are: two excellent, underhyped bands and a cover charge that doesn't necessitate a trip to the A.T.M. Pela, from Brooklyn, calls its style ''pastoral punk,'' which means wide-open skies of bouncy, Pixiesesque basslines and sharp, sparkling guitars that recall the Strokes and U2. The High Strung, whose members are based in Detroit but did time in New York, live up to their name with antsy, accelerated songs that draw from both the raggedness of garage rock and the bright, clear lines of New Wave. The band gets extra points for touring dozens of public libraries. With XYZ Affair and the Teeth. At 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario) * SAVAGE REPUBLIC (Tomorrow) Between 1980 and 1989, this Los Angeles band released four albums of droning, pounding, brawling postpunk that could be assaultive or hypnotic -- a West Coast counterpart to early Public Image Ltd., Swans and Sonic Youth. Touring sporadically since the reissue of its complete catalog in 2002, the group comes to Club Midway in the East Village. Tomorrow's Friend, Va Va China and Oliver North open the show. At 8 p.m., 25 Avenue B, at Second Street, (212) 253-2595, clubmidway.com; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Pareles) * SONIC YOUTH (Tonight) Conventional wisdom would say it should have burned out years ago: Sonic Youth has been treading the same shaggy avant-indie path since the early 1980s, and each of its members has had plenty of other interests to pursue. But since its 2002 album ''Murray Street,'' partly about life after 9/11, the band has hit a wonderful new stride, and on its latest album, ''Rather Ripped'' (Geffen), sounds as comfortable, focused and invigorated as ever. With Wooden Wand. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) ROD STEWART (Wednesday) His four Great American Songbook albums may not represent the most distinguished readings of those songs -- ditto his Bob Seger and Creedence Clearwater Revival covers on the recent ''Still the Same Great Rock Classics of Our Time'' (J) -- but when Rod Stewart lets go of his smugness, that whisky tenor of his can be a powerful interpretive instrument. Doesn't happen often, though. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-7171, thegarden.com; $55 to $129.50. (Sisario) SUPER DIAMOND (Tonight and tomorrow night) A tribute to the songs of Neil Diamond, particularly his triumphal 1970s material. Smirking is optional. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) * LOS TIGRES DEL NORTE (Tomorrow) One of the most popular and longest-running bands in the Americas, Los Tigres del Norte, from the western Mexican state of Sinaloa, have for 35 years been setting gritty stories of drug smugglers, immigrants and other hardscrabble characters to the bopping, accordion-driven polkas of norteño (a sound better known on this side of the border as Tex-Mex). The group regularly draws thousands to its shows in New York, and tomorrow it plays the 60,000-square-foot Bedford Avenue Armory in Brooklyn. At 8 p.m., 1579 Bedford Avenue, at President Street, Crown Heights, (646) 261-1588; $40. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. ALL-STAR ORGAN SUMMIT (Tonight and tomorrow night) This descriptively titled engagement features no fewer than three Hammond B-3 organists -- Jimmy McGriff, Dr. Lonnie Smith and Reuben Wilson -- together with the tenor saxophonist Jerry Weldon and the guitarist Peter Bernstein, among others. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $30. (Nate Chinen) SAM BARSH BAND (Tonight) The sharp young keyboardist Sam Barsh leads a groove-minded working band with Tim Collins on vibraphone, Ari Folman-Cohen on bass and Jaimeo Brown on drums. At 10, 11 and 12:30, Rose Live Music, 345 Grand Street, between Havemeyer and Marcy Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-0069, liveatrose.com; cover, $7. (Chinen) * BRIAN BLADE FELLOWSHIP (Tuesday through Thursday) Brian Blade is an unusually sensitive drummer, as he has proven not only with Wayne Shorter but also with Joni Mitchell. He turns the spotlight to his own painterly compositions in this influential ensemble with the saxophonists Myron Walden and Melvin Butler, the guitarist Peter Bernstein, the pianist Jon Cowherd and the bassist Christopher Thomas. (Through Feb. 25.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) JOHNATHAN BLAKE QUARTET (Tomorrow) The drummer Johnathan Blake propels a band with two sure-footed saxophonists -- Jaleel Shaw, on alto, and Joel Frahm, on tenor -- as well as the pianist Orrin Evans and the bassist Joe Martin. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; $10 for members. (Chinen) BROOKLYN QAWWALI PARTY (Tomorrow) The Sufi devotional music of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan provides a repertory mandate for this ensemble, led by the trumpeter Jesse Neuman. Faithful to its source mainly in terms of exuberance, the group creates a roiling polyphony of percussion, saxophones, brass, bass, harmonium and guitar. At 9 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) CYRUS CHESTNUT QUARTET WITH CARLA COOK (Tuesday through Thursday) Cyrus Chestnut is a pianist with a penchant for gospel harmonies, as he will demonstrate here with a rhythm section and Ms. Cook, a powerful singer. (Through Feb. 25.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) KURT ELLING (Tonight through Sunday night) Mr. Elling's deep musicality and literary sensibility have made him the leading male jazz vocalist of our time, though perhaps not the most consistent. He comes with a rhythm section, led by the pianist Laurence Hobgood, and a handful of special guests. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) EXPLODING HEART/EXPLORATIONS (Tomorrow) Explosion and exploration are sure to be closely related processes in both these ad hoc ensembles. Exploding Heart consists of Tony Malaby on saxophones, William Parker on bass and Nasheet Waits on drums; Explorations features the alto saxophonist Matana Roberts and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) FIVE OF A KIND (Tuesday) This collaborative quintet, which makes its debut here, features ambitious musician-composers with a shared interest in world music: the trumpeter Avishai Cohen, the saxophonist Joel Frahm, the pianist Jason Lindner, the bassist Omer Avital and the drummer Johnathan Blake. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen) DON FRIEDMAN (Tonight) Mr. Friedman's stylistic history as a pianist runs from traditional to slightly left of center; he's likely to range freely in this recital at Fazioli Salon, a solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $25. (Chinen) AARON GOLDBERG 3 PLUS STEFON HARRIS (Wednesday and Thursday) On his last album, ''Worlds'' (Sunnyside), the pianist Aaron Goldberg showcased the strong rapport of his working trio, with the bassist Reuben Rogers and the drummer Eric Harland.

(Chinen) MARY HALVORSON AND JESSICA PAVONE (Wednesday) Ms. Halvorson plays acoustic guitar in this duo, and Ms. Pavone plays viola. Their experimental instincts, honed by an affiliation with the composer Anthony Braxton, commingle with folksy lyricism; they even sing, without a shred of protective irony. At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) * AHMAD JAMAL TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) A touchstone of jazz piano since the 1950s, Mr. Jamal still has his broad, dynamic range and signature touch, as he proved on a recent live album, ''After Fajr'' (Dreyfus). He also has a no-nonsense rhythm team: the bassist James Cammack and the drummer Idris Muhammad. (Through Feb. 25.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $40 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA QUARTET (Tonight) ''Codebook'' (Pi), the latest album by the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, investigates the topic of cryptography, not the most promising theme for an improviser. What lifts the project off the ground is the brazen imaginative exertion of his band, with Vijay Iyer on piano, Carlo DeRosa on bass and Dan Weiss on drums. At midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10; $5 for students; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) JOE MARTIN QUARTET (Thursday) Joe Martin, a reliably supportive bassist, turns the spotlight on his own compositions and on the interplay of a promising quartet, with John Ellis on saxophones, Aaron Parks on piano and Marcus Gilmore on drums.

MONK (Wednesday and Thursday) Thelonious Sphere Monk Jr., a loquacious drummer whose taste skews less idiosyncratic than his father's, leads a polished hard-bop band. (Through Feb. 24.)

(Chinen) * MY BAND FOOT FOOT (Tomorrow) The Shaggs, a trio of sisters from New Hampshire -- and by common consensus one of the very best truly awful rock bands of all time -- receive a jazz makeover from a sextet led by the wry trumpeter John McNeil. This is the project's first performance; results could be bad, which might be all the better. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) OREGON (Tonight through Sunday night) This influential and worldly ensemble, formed more than 35 years ago, has continued making its distinctive light fusion over the years, sometimes in orchestral settings. Its lineup features the guitarist Ralph Towner, the bassist Glen Moore and the woodwind player Paul McCandless -- all founding members -- along with the drummer Mark Walker. At 8:30 and 10:30, with a midnight set tonight and tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jean-Michel Pilc's piano playing has a joyous bounce, no matter how dark or furious the extemporization.

(Chinen) ODEAN POPE TRIO (Tomorrow) Odean Pope is best recognized for his Saxophone Choir, a powerful and vivid post-Coltrane assembly based in his hometown, Philadelphia. Here the only saxophonist on hand is Mr. Pope himself, though his full-blown style might make it seem otherwise. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 756-7600, sistasplace.org; cover, $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Chinen) * DAFNIS PRIETO AND THE ABSOLUTE QUINTET (Tonight) The drummer Dafnis Prieto's ''Absolute Quintet'' (Zoho) might not have won the Grammy for best Latin jazz album, but that doesn't diminish its power. Dramatic and serious, it makes references to the avant-garde and early fusion, but always with a lifeline to Latin rhythm; its cast includes Yosvany Terry on saxophones, Christian Howes on violin, Dana Leong on cello and Jason Lindner on piano and organ. At 7:30, Harlem Stage at the Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at West 135th Street, (212) 650-7100, harlemstage.org; $25. (Chinen) * RECONNECTED: THE FREDDIE REDD QUARTET (Monday) In the late 1950s, the pianist Freddie Redd wrote music for ''The Connection,'' a landmark Off Broadway play in which he also appeared onstage. Released on Blue Note, the subsequent album became a hard-bop classic, though that didn't prevent Mr. Redd from slipping into obscurity. He resurfaces here with the bassist Mickey Bass and the drummer Louis Hayes; Donald Harrison inherits the alto saxophone part memorably played by Jackie McLean, who died last year. Another alto saxophone veteran, Lou Donaldson, appears in the concert's first half. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $30 in advance, $35 on Monday.

Here he regroups most of its cast: Chuck MacKinnon on trumpet, Ron Oswanski on Fender Rhodes piano and accordion, Kermit Driscoll on bass and John Hollenbeck on drums. At 8 p.m., Nightingale Lounge, 213 Second Avenue, at 13th Street, East Village, (212) 473-9398, nightingalelounge.com; cover, $8.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'EUGENE ONEGIN' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The dynamic conductor Valery Gergiev and the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky bring stylistic authority to the Metropolitan Opera's affecting revival of its 1997 production of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin.'' In his first Met performances of the title role, Mr. Hvorostovsky is riveting, singing with earthy richness and fully conveying this worldly, entitled and dashing young man's aloofness until the final tragic scene. The surprises come from the soprano Renée Fleming, in her first Russian role at the Met, who gives a vocally exquisite and vulnerable portrayal of Tatiana, and the tenor Ramón Vargas, a Bel Canto specialist, who makes an ardent and endearing Lenski, Onegin's well-meaning but fatally impulsive friend. You will seldom see better acting in opera than from this excellent cast. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'IPHIGÉNIE EN AULIDE' (Monday and Wednesday) The opera productions at the Juilliard School have generally been thoughtfully staged and vocally polished, with casts of student singers who may be heard from on grander stages. The school is also judicious in its repertory choices, presenting works not normally offered at the Met or the New York City Opera. ''Iphigénie en Aulide'' has much to recommend it, as Gluck's dramatically focused and supremely lyrical operas invariably do. The cast for Robin Guarino's production includes Tharanga Goonetilleke in the title role; Paul LaRosa and Sidney Outlaw sharing the role of Agamemnon; Faith Sherman as Clytemnestra; and Paul Appleby as Achille, with Ari Pelto conducting. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free. (Allan Kozinn) * 'JENUFA' (Tomorrow) The charismatic Finnish soprano Karita Mattila is riveting in the title role of Leos Janacek's grim, insightful and, by the end, consoling Czech opera ''Jenufa,'' in the Met's revival of its 2003 production by Olivier Tambosi. Ms. Mattila's gleaming voice, with its cool, Nordic colorings and vibrant sensuality, are ideal for this character, a foolishly trusting young woman in a Moravian village who has become pregnant by her cousin, the town rake who owns the local mill. The ageless German soprano Anja Silja is at once terrifying and pitiable as Jenufa's stern stepmother, Kostelnicka. Jiri Belohlavek conducts a sensitive and sweeping account of Janacek's teeming score, presented in its 1908 version. Tomorrow's matinee is the final performance of the season. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220. (Tommasini) * 'THE Maid of Orleans' (Thursday) The Collegiate Chorale's annual opera-in-concert presentations focus on infrequently performed works. This year Daniele Callegari conducts Tchaikovsky's ''Maid of Orleans,'' which the composer based on Friedrich Schiller's play ''Die Jungfrau von Orleans.'' According to the company, the work has never been fully staged by the Metropolitan Opera or the New York City Opera. The mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick sings the title role; Carol Vaness is Agnes; Oleg Kulko is Charles VII; Igor Tarasov is Lionel; and Andrei Antonov is Thibaut. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $155. (Vivien Schweitzer) * 'SIMON BOCCANEGRA' (Monday) ''Boccanegra'' is the kind of opera that gives opera plots a bad name: the action begins with a prologue and then scoots ahead 25 years (requiring some prodigious feats from the makeup artist), after which half the characters seem to be appearing under assumed names. Verdi himself took nearly 25 years off from it before going back and revising large chunks, creating some magnificent music but uneven dramaturgy. Yet there is much to love in ''Boccanegra,'' and the Met's cast -- Thomas Hampson, who has done it in Vienna; Angela Gheorghiu; Marcello Giordani; and Ferruccio Furlanetto -- should be able to do it credit. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175 tickets remaining. (Anne Midgette) 'THÉRÈSE RAQUIN' (Tonight through Sunday) Admirers of Tobias Picker's opera ''An American Tragedy,'' which had its premiere at the Met last season, will want to attend the New York premiere of his 2001 opera, ''Thérèse Raquin,'' with a libretto by Gene Scheer. Mr. Picker's adaptation of Zola's piercing and, at the time, scandalous novel of adultery and murder (an oppressed young woman, married to a weak mother's boy, falls for a hunky and boisterous office worker, with fatal consequences) had its premiere at the Dallas Opera, where it received a mixed critical reception. The composer has recently revised the score and thinned down the orchestration. Steven Osgood conducts; Michael Capasso directs. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, at St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tonight and Thursday night) For its revival of Verdi's ''Traviata,'' in Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production, the Met is rotating casts, with three sopranos sharing the role of Violetta this season. Mary Dunleavy, who made her company debut in 1993, is currently singing the role. Wookyung Kim, a promising young Korean tenor with a robust, lyrical voice, sings Alfredo, the role of his Met debut this season, and the baritone Charles Taylor sings Germont. Carlo Rizzi conducts. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 tickets remaining tonight; $80 and $175 on Thursday. (Tommasini) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Wednesday) The revival of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberflöte'' continues at the Met, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. James Levine conducts a cast that includes Lisa Milne as Pamina, Cornelia Götz as Queen of the Night, Michael Schade as Pamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno and Eike Wilm Schulte as the Speaker. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 and $175 tickets remaining. (Schweitzer) Classical Music ACADEMY OF ST. MARTIN IN THE FIELDS (Sunday and Monday) The venerable and ever-prolific conductor Neville Marriner returns to the area with his orchestra of choice, performing Stravinsky and Beethoven. The talented and not at all venerable Jonathan Biss is pianist in Mozart's C minor Concerto. Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $24 to $88. Monday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $96. (Bernard Holland) AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Steven Mercurio conducts Beethoven, Debussy and Delius, but the evening is perhaps more about the soprano Sumi Jo, who will do a collection of operatic numbers. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $85. (Holland) BORROMEO STRING QUARTET (Tonight) This formidable and, with more than 100 concerts a year, very busy quartet plays a demanding if fairly familiar program, with Stravinsky's Concertino, Bartok's Fifth Quartet and Beethoven's Quartet in E minor, the second of the three astounding ''Razumovsky'' Quartets. At 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Tommasini) * RENAUD CAPUÇON (Sunday) The violinist Renaud Capuçon is fast making a name for himself as a soloist and chamber musician, often performing with Gautier Capuçon, his talented cellist brother. Here he makes his New York recital debut with the pianist Nicholas Angelich in a program featuring the three Brahms Sonatas for Violin and Piano, as part of the affordably priced Peoples' Symphony Concerts lineup. At 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; sold out.

(Holland) JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Tonight and Tuesday night) The conductor Andreas Delfs led the premiere last April of Lowell Liebermann's opera ''Miss Lonelyhearts.'' He returns tonight to conduct the talented young musicians of the Juilliard Orchestra in Mr. Liebermann's Piano Concerto No. 2, with the pianist Vasileios Varvaresos. The program also includes Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5 and Heiner Goebbels's ''D&C'' (the third movement from his 1994 work ''Surrogate Cities''). On Tuesday James DePreist leads the Julliard Orchestra in Haydn's Symphony No. 88 in G, Strauss's Oboe Concerto and Elgar's Violin Concerto. Tonight at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; $10 and $20; free for students and 65+. Tuesday at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center; free, but tickets are required.

(Schweitzer) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) Lorin Maazel and his orchestra continue their exploration of Brahms tomorrow and Tuesday, with performances of the Serenade No. 2 -- which isn't heard nearly enough -- and the Piano Concerto No. 2. Emanuel Ax, a superb Brahmsian, is the soloist in the concerto. On Thursday Mr. Maazel offers a varied program intended to show off soloists within the orchestra. Included are Mozart's Concerto for Flute and Harp, with Robert Langevin, the flutist, and Nancy Allen, the harpist; Schumann's taxing Konzertstück for Four Horns, in which the soloists are Philip Myers, Erik Ralske, R. Allen Spanjer and Howard Wall; and a Trombone Concerto by Melinda Wagner, with Joseph Alessi as the soloist. Also on the program is Gershwin's ''American in Paris.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $35 to $101 tomorrow; $33 to $99 on Tuesday; $28 to $94 on Thursday. (Kozinn) ORLANDO CONSORT (Sunday) This remarkable English vocal quartet builds its programs of medieval and Renaissance works around literary or historical themes and has released recordings of several on the Harmonia Mundi label, packaged as CD-size hardcover books, with artwork and text translations. The group's 2005 disc, ''The Rose, the Lily and the Whortleberry'' explores works inspired by medieval gardens and flora (and their metaphorical imagery), including works by Machaut, Power, Agricola, de Rore and other composers from England, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. Those works will make up the heart of the ensemble's program in its two performances at the Cloisters. At 1 and 3 p.m., Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 650-2290, metmuseum.org; $35. (Kozinn) JOHN SCOTT (Tomorrow) Mr. Scott, the organist and music director at St. Thomas Church, plays the fourth concert in his 10-part series exploring the organ works of Buxtehude, in honor of the 300th anniversary of the composer's death. Built in a style similar to that of north Germany and the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries, St. Thomas's Taylor & Boody organ is ideal for this venture. At 4 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org; free. (Schweitzer) * 'TONDAL'S VISION' (Sunday) Early-music fans, take note. Dialogos, the acclaimed ensemble that took part in ''Chant Wars'' here in 2005, is returning to New York (thanks to Music Before 1800) with a production that has won awards throughout Europe: a 12th-century story of a knight who leaves his body, told through medieval Croatian vocal music. The six-woman piece was conceived by Dialogos's director, Katarina Livljanic, and staged in collaboration with Yoshi Oida, an actor who has worked frequently with Peter Brook.

At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $60, with limited availability.

To celebrate the company's 30th anniversary, he has created a new work, ''The Ritual of the Roda,'' that traces the history of capoeira; the kickboxing fireworks artfully transformed into dance should be well worth seeing.

(Anderson) REGINA NEJMAN & Company (Tonight through Sunday night) Ms. Nejman's new ''Frozen Baby'' is described as a ''dance installation,'' which might indicate that there won't be too much dancing. But Ms. Nejman is a choreographer who revels in sheer physicality, and there should be plenty of high-energy movement to watch. The work is set to commissioned music by Mio Morales, whose last score for Ms. Nejman was a compelling mix of Brazilian pop and sharp electronic rhythyms.

(Dunning) NEW YORK FLAMENCO FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Two of the great contemporary Spanish flamenco divas promise to get the weekend off to a fiery start, beginning with Rafaela Carrasco and her company tonight, and Ballet Flamenco Sara Baras tomorrow and Sunday. Ms. Carrasco threatens to explore new concepts in flamenco. Perhaps she will go easy on that august art. Ms. Baras, known particularly for her fast feet, is air to Ms. Carrasco's earth. And Carmen Cortés, fast approaching divadom, will offer examples of Gypsy flamenco puro in a program on Thursday with the flamenco guitarist Gerardo Núñez and his quintet. (Through Feb. 24.) Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday night at 8; Sunday at 7 p.m., City Center (Carrasco and Baras), 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; and Skirball Center for the Performing Arts (Cortés), 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 545-7536, worldmusicinstitute.org; $30 and $70 (Carrasco/Baras); $42 and $50 (Cortés). (Dunning) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow, Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) LeeSaar the Company, a gutsy, brainy modern-dance troupe founded seven years ago in Tel Aviv, is performing this weekend in this five-week festival with new and repertory dances. On Wednesday through Feb. 24, Claire Porter/Portables mixes dance, storytelling and blithe and nutty humor in her work, which here includes her new ''Words Away From Home.'' LeeSaar tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m.; Claire Porter/Portables Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500, 92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; $10 for students and 65+.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: MARTíN RAMíREZ, through April 29. Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith) * Grey Art Gallery: 'Semina Culture: Wallace Berman & His Circle,' through March 31. The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) may ring only a faint bell to many New Yorkers, but he was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780. (Holland Cotter) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velázquezes and Zurbaráns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalís and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. Velázquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Henri Cartier-Bresson's Scrapbook: Photographs, 1932-46,' through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It's an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. He became a celebrity in America. He photographed Fred Astaire dancing and Joan Crawford poolside. In the breezy layouts of Harper's Bazaar, the work looked brilliant. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * The MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) Morgan Library & Museum: 'Private Treasures: Four Centuries of European Master Drawings,' through April 8. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The works span more than 400 years, from the 16th to the early 20th century, and include drawings in ink and pencil, watercolor, chalk and gouache. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn't an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one's craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example -- and the most historically significant work here -- is a black chalk drawing, ''The Dead Christ'' (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don't know where they came from, where they're going, or when you'll see them again. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Martha Schwendener) * Museum of Modern Art: Armando ReverÓn, through April 16. Unless you spotted his single smoke-puff of a painting at MoMA months ago, Armando Reverón probably means nothing to you. Why should he? The artist, who died in 1954, spent most of his life in a shack by the sea in his native Venezuela. Many of his contemporaries dismissed him as nuts. His white-on-white pictures are practically unphotographable. But chances are that if you visit this retrospective, you'll find yourself thinking about him a lot. His art and his story are like few others, and so is the museum's inspired installation: a single, long corridor with cabinetlike rooms of paintings on either side and, at the very end, against a sea-green wall, a life-size doll with giant bat wings floating overhead. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter) Neuberger Museum of Art: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77, through June 24. This artist is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn't stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, print-making, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100. (Smith) Last Chance * Tony Conrad In 1973 the conceptual artist, composer and filmmaker Tony Conrad decided to make a movie that would last a lifetime, so he painted white squares on big, scroll-like sheets of paper and hung the results on the wall for a one-night ''screening.'' In fact, those ''Yellow Movies'' have been playing ever since, the action being physical change through the effects of time and light. Displayed in a gallery more than 30 years later, they are an exhilarating sight: Zen thankas that are also abstract paintings that are also existential projection screens. The film of a lifetime is still in progress. Greene Naftali, 526 West 26th Street, eighth floor, Chelsea, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter). * 'Let Everything Be Temporary, Or When Is the Exhibition?' Some of the best art ever made was meant to fade away, and in these days of serious object-glut, a little ephemerality comes as a relief. That's the point of this barely-there show organized by Elena Filipovic. To a Felix Gonzalez-Torres pile of freebie candy, she adds Gabriel Kuri's display of ripening avocadoes; Joëlle Tuerlinckx's site-specific confetti floor piece; Oksana Pasaiko's disappearing soap; and Michel Blazy's mashed-potato mural. A wall text by Tomo Savic-Gecan speculates on giving market value to art that is in a constant state of change. The artist Boris Belay is filming the whole disappearing show through tomorrow. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, apexart.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' The 100 paintings and drawings on display here are by 10 artists, including George Grosz, Christian Schad and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble; we look into the faces of museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Monday. (Smith) * The MET: SET IN STONE: THE FACE IN MEDIEVAL SCULPTURE One of those revelatory close-ups at which the Metropolitan Museum of Art excels, This show brings together nearly 80 carved, mostly limestone heads, mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries, mostly torn during bouts of iconoclasm from the sculptures and reliefs that turned Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches into Bibles in stone. There are excellent side trips, into the grotesque, the influence of the antique, the glimmers of the Renaissance and a new isotope-matching technique that helping to divine which heads come from where. The treatments of hair and beard with which medieval sculptors were more at ease than they were with, say, eyes or smiles, are almost a show within a show, as, in their own way, are the haunting, seemingly modernist works that look like nothing else here. (212) 535-7710; closes on Monday. (Smith) * Vera Iliatova For her New York solo debut, the Russian-born artist Vera Iliatova delivers a group of small, detailed, atmospheric paintings in which groups of young women -- all self-portraits of the artist -- gather in bucolic settings that make Eden a place of exile. In one painting we are simultaneously in a Poussinian glade, a Brooklyn tenement and a ruined resort. Autumn trees blaze; fighter planes pass overhead. Two women appear in the poses of Masaccio's Adam and Eve after the Fall; others talk, wrestle and wail. Monya Rowe Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Room 605, Chelsea, (212) 255-5065, monyarowegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * 'Networked Nature' This cool little show, organized by Marisa Olson for Rhizome, a new-media organization associated with the New Museum of Contemporary Art, filters that old Romantic standby, Nature, through the new-fangled technology. Philip Ross powers hydroponic plant environments with LED lighting; Shih-Chieh Huang creates an inflatable flower through concepts from robotics. A California collective, C5, evokes ''sublime locales'' through global positioning systems. Stephen Vitiello has the voices George W. Bush whispering in an ivy bush; Gail Wight, in a video called ''Creep,'' makes slime mold look sort of beautiful. Foxy Production, 617 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-2758; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) MARIO SCHIFANO: PAINTINGS 1960-1966 All but indivisible in New York for 40 years, the work of this Italian artist, who died in 1998 at the age of 64, receives a stirring welcome back in this exhibition of 20 drawings and paintings. In monochromes on brown paper and in canvases involving the Coca-Cola logo and pieces of Plexiglas, Pop and Minimalism are joined almost before they were invented. The more homegrown influence of Arte Povera is visible in the startling nonchalance and even roughness of some works. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, Chelsea, (212) 999-7337; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in rural Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ADRIFT IN MACAO' Christopher Durang wrote the book (cute) and lyrics (crude) for this fortune-cookie-sized musical set in a Chinese port in the 1950s. Flimsy but fun, this spoof of old movies is lovingly acted by a swell cast, although an hour after it's over, you may be hungry for reruns of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'ALL THAT I WILL EVER BE' In this false-feeling comedy-drama by Alan Ball, creator of ''Six Feet Under,'' a gay hustler undergoes an identity crisis when he finds himself falling for one of his clients. Slick but mostly stale in its analysis of a society afraid of emotional engagement (2:15). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'BLIND LEMON BLUES' An exuberant musical tribute to Blind Lemon Jefferson, arguably the biggest country-blues musician of the 1920s. The facts of his life are vague, and as a result, the narrative is almost dreamlike. A delightful evening (1:50). Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820. (Ginia Bellafante) 'THE FEVER' Wallace Shawn performs his provocative monologue about a guilt-riddled bourgeois everyman sweating his way through a moral crisis. The rich, often hypnotic writing draws us into his tortured mindscape, as he shifts between shame over his sense of entitlement and reasoned arguments that sacrifice is unnecessary and pointless. Meanwhile, in the third world, the violence and poverty continue unabated (1:30). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'THE LAST WORD ' Oren Safdie's comedy about cultural generation gaps amuses as it goes along but lands at a predictable nowhere. Daniel J. Travanti stars as a Viennese Jew and aspiring playwright who does battle with a young student angling to become his writing assistant and find his voice (1:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'THE MADRAS HOUSE' A century-old drama about ''the woman question,'' this rare revival of Harley Granville Barker's fascinating play is more contemporary than you might think (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. ( Zinoman) 'MARAT/SADE' The first New York production of Peter Weiss's classic 1963 play captures the rawness and shock of the original with a harrowing production. The inmates of this all-male asylum fling themselves against the chain-links of their enclosure; realistic-looking vomit and feces feature in one key scene; the audience is sprayed with water from the attendants' hoses and reminded that theater is not always a safe place. It's undeniably powerful; unfortunately, it remains a blunt instrument rather than a polished one, since the language is not mined as deeply as the emotion. Marat and Sade's philosophical debate, and the play's topicality, tend to be obscured by the sheer brute force of what's happening onstage (2:10). The Classical Theater of Harlem, Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 647 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) 'MARY ROSE' J. M. Barrie penned this distaff variation on themes from ''Peter Pan'' in 1920, and it has mostly lain on the shelf since. A young English girl (an exuberant Paige Howard) acquires the odd habit of disappearing and reappearing some time later, untouched by time's passing. Gentle and melancholy, handsomely mounted by Tina Landau, ''Mary Rose'' is nonetheless itself touched by the mark of time (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' and 'THE JEW OF MALTA' F. Murray Abraham plays two Elizabethan villains in repertory for the Theater for a New Audience. Mr. Abraham's sinister but still moving Shylock is the dark heart of Darko Tresnjak's chilly, powerful staging of one of Shakespeare's unfunniest comedies. As Barabas in David Herskovits's goofy, postmodern ''Jew of Malta,'' he's the lively center of a carnival that doesn't do justice to Christopher Marlowe's harsh satire on Christian hypocrisy and venality (each 2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A SPANISH PLAY' The great Zoe Caldwell returns to the New York stage after an absence of a decade, in the fine company of Linda Emond, Denis O'Hare and Larry Pine. That's the good news. The bad? The play. Yasmina Reza's pseudo-philosophical and metatheatrical trifle is utterly forgettable (1:50). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'A VERY COMMON PROCEDURE' Courtney Baron's play suffers from a very common problem: For at least half of this one-act's running time, the characters onstage are talking to us, not one another. Paradoxically, this intimacy between audience and actors keeps the story -- an odd love affair between a woman grieving the death of her baby and the doctor involved in the baby's death -- at arm's length (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'NELSON' Three arresting performances catch your attention in this creepy play by Sam Marks about a young man who is an office flunky by day but films gang videos at night. But having set a lot of intriguing things in motion, Mr. Marks is afraid to let them collide head-on (1:10). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE CRYING WOMAN' An imaginative play that manages to transform what begins as a tired culture-clash comedy involving a Mexican and United States couple sharing a house in Mexico City into a sinister tale involving strange superstitions and a ghost from the 16th century (2:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Wilborn Hampton) 'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective (1:40). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 253-9983; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'DUTCHMAN' A revival of the poet Amiri Baraka's screed on race and American values, 43 years after its Greenwich Village debut, aims for all the fire and might of a Malcolm X speech but none of the rhetorical elegance. It shouts so loudly that you can't hear a thing (1:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Bellafante) 'THE FRUGAL REPAST' This sweet, compact story by Ron Hirsen dabbles in the high concepts of art, but not too deeply, which makes it just right. Two circus performers see Picasso's ''Frugal Repast'' in a dealer's window and realize they were the models for it; when they steal the print, their lowbrow world and Picasso's highbrow one amusingly collide (1:20). The June Havoc Theater, Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'LOOKINGGLASS ALICE' Eyecatching entertainment (1:30). The New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' Shakespeare's comedy, so dependent on things that aren't what they appear to be, makes an inspired choice for Theater by the Blind, a group that mixes blind, vision-impaired and fully sighted actors. The most intriguing thing, though, is how the company stages the play with just six actors (1:50). The Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'THE SECRET OF MME. BONNARD'S BATH' A dutiful bio-play about the French symbolist Pierre Bonnard is a ''Behind the Music'' for the art history set (2:00). The Kirk Theater, Theater Row Studios, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. ( Zinoman) 'VICTORIA MARTIN: MATH TEAM QUEEN' Must all stage teenagers speak in that exaggerated surfer-dude style in which ''awesome'' and ''totally'' make up about 50 percent of any conversation? Yes, apparently they must, from the evidence presented in this thin comedy, which is about a high school girl who finds herself on the all-male math team. The playwright, Kathryn Walat, seems to have been trying to grab the coattails of a certain spelling-bee-related show. She missed (2:00). The Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Thursday. (Genzlinger) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AVENUE MONTAIGNE' (PG-13, 100 minutes, in French) A humble pleasure about love and art, about passing time and time passing, from the French director Danièle Thompson, who populates one Parisian street with minor incidents, comic faces, choreographed nonsense and melodramatic blips and swells. (Manohla Dargis) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott) * 'BAMAKO' (No rating, 118 minutes, in French and Bambara) Abdelrahmane Sissako's new film is an indictment of the West's complicity in Africa's misery, staged as a public trial of the World Bank and its affiliates. The film's passionate didacticism is both enriched and subverted by Mr. Sissako's deft, subtle attention to the details of daily life in the capital of Mali, where the movie takes place. (Scott) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn misery into entertainment. (Dargis) 'BREACH' (PG-13, 110 minutes) In his fine, no-nonsense account of the capture of the F.B.I. agent turned mole Robert Philip Hanssen, the director Billy Ray manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe star. (Dargis) * 'BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA' (PG, 95 minutes) Grounded more in reality than in fantasy, this smart adaptation of Katherine Paterson's award-winning novel offers an affecting story of a transformative friendship between two unusually gifted children. Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare, the director, Gabor Csupo, keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superb thriller directed by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others. (Dargis) 'CLOSE TO HOME' (No rating, 94 minutes, in Hebrew) This movie minutely scrutinizes the daily routine of two spirited women, both 18-year-old conscripts in the Israeli army, who work as a team patrolling the streets of Jerusalem. It adopts the tunnel vision of impatient, self-centered soldiers gritting their teeth as they fulfill their two-year military obligation. (Stephen Holden) * 'DAYS OF GLORY' (R, 120 minutes, in French) Rachid Bouchareb's tale of North African soldiers fighting to free their French colonial masters from German Occupation during World War II is a potent combat picture, and also a searching and complex political drama. (Scott) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'FACTORY GIRL' (R, 91 minutes) It's not entirely inappropriate that this film, George Hickenlooper's biography of Edie Sedgwick, the most glamorous of Andy Warhol's so-called superstars, should suggest a magazine layout masquerading as a film. The world through which Ms. Sedgwick (Sienna Miller) blazed and burned out was one that lived and died by the camera. It existed to be seen and drooled over. But God help you if you actually lived in it. (Holden) 'GHOST RIDER' (PG-13, 114 minutes) After a long string of flops, Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze, a stunt motorcycle rider whose soul belongs to the Devil. Despite the promise of the first 30 minutes -- when Johnny is played by the charming young actor Matt Long -- a witless script and a central character who's more funny than frightening suggest that the filmmakers' franchise hopes may be dashed. (Catsoulis) 'GRBAVICA: THE LAND OF MY DREAMS' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Bosnian) In a neighborhood of Sarajevo that was the site of a notorious prison camp, a single mother lives with her tomboyish 12-year-old daughter. The tension between the present and the recent past is embodied in the volatile relationship between mother and daughter, which comes to a boil over the issue of the girl's paternity. (Holden) 'HANNIBAL RISING' (R, 121 minutes) Marked by too much respect and too little energy, this primer on the early years of Hannibal Lecter reduces one of our most mythic villains to a callow, dysfunctional chef. Orphaned in World War II, our psychopathic hero hunts down his family's killers and snacks on their remains. But burrowing into the id of pop culture's most repulsive gourmet demands a sanguinary glee that the director, Peter Webber, may not possess; for all the movie's spurting gore, there's no accompanying rush of blood to the head. (Catsoulis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis) * 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS' (R, 137 minutes, in German) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature takes place in East Berlin in 1984, and it is a smart, moving inquiry into the moral predicament facing good people in a bad system. Ulrich Mühe's performance as a conscience-stricken Stasi officer is a tightly wound tour de force, and Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are both superb as a playwright and his actress lover who are drawn into the cruel, absurd clutches of the Communist secret police. (Scott) 'MUSIC AND LYRICS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant phone in passable impersonations of themselves in this competent romantic comedy, which is somewhat enlivened by parodies of bad pop songs from both the 1980s and the present. (Scott) 'NORBIT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Eddie Murphy plays a nebbish, a fat woman and a Chinese restaurant owner in this crude, sometimes mean, but often funny farce. (Scott) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zoë Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'THE ROYAL GUARD' (No rating, 107 minutes, in Hindi) Vidhu Vinod Chopra's somber drama is a contemporary tale about the aging, devoted protector (Amitabh Bachchan) of an aristocratic family out to avenge his master's murder. Though it combines Shakespearean ambience with snatches of genre cinema (westerns, martial arts movies), the film is primarily a tribute to the singular presence of Mr. Bachchan, a monumental Bollywood legend of indisputable seriousness. (Andy Webster) '79th ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS NOMINATED SHORT FILMS: FEATURES AND ANIMATION' (No rating, 137 minutes) This grab bag of 5 live-action shorts and 10 animated shorts is heavy on production values but light on true idiosyncrasy, much less daring. The best of the bunch are the animated short film ''The Danish Poet,'' with the actress Liv Ullmann narrating the story of an accidental meeting between an obscure poet and a famous writer that ultimately produced a child, and the live-action ''Eramos Pocos (One Too Many),'' in which a husband deals with his wife's sudden disappearance by convincing his mother-in-law to become his maid. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodóvar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) Film Series BELA TARR TRILOGY (Tonight through Sunday) The Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr makes dark, damp and moody dramas, usually set in bleak small towns where long takes and elaborate camera movements are used to unite the inarticulate characters in webs of lust and deceit. Three of his most critically celebrated films are based on the work of the novelist Laszlo Krasznahorkai, and all will be presented this weekend at the BAMcinématek in Brooklyn: ''Damnation'' (1988) today; the 450-minute ''Satantango''(1994) on Saturday; and Mr. Tarr's most recent effort, ''Werckmeister Harmonies'' (2000) on Sunday. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, www.bam.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) FILM COMMENT SELECTS (Tonight through Tuesday) There's still quite a lot to see in the final days of this lively series of new films and revivals programmed by the editors of Film Comment magazine. Screening this afternoon and Sunday evening is Robert Aldrich's red-hot political thriller of 1977, ''Twilight's Last Gleaming,'' in an uncut print from Mr. Aldrich's personal archives. Perhaps the most radical critique of America's Vietnam policy in the English-speaking cinema, it remains unavailable on domestic DVD. Tomorrow brings two recent films by the great landscape filmmaker James Benning, ''Ten Skies'' (10 10-minute shots of shifting skies) and ''13 Lakes'' (13 10-minute shots of lakes that reflect the landscape behind them). On Sunday and Monday, there's the United States premiere of ''These Encounters of Theirs,'' the final film collaboration by Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet, and on Tuesday the series comes to an odd anticlimax with Paul Verhoeven's highly commercial World War II drama ''Black Book.'' Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5601, filmlinc.org; $10. (Kehr) PICTURES IN PRINT: LILLIAN ROSS AND THE MOVIES (Tonight through Wednesday) The New Yorker writer Lillian Ross has specialized in covering film-related subjects since the early '50s, when she profiled the director John Huston at work on ''The Red Badge of Courage'' in a series of articles that were later published as ''Picture.'' This tribute to Ms. Ross and her reportage begins tonight, appropriately, with a screening of ''Red Badge,'' introduced by Ms. Ross and followed by a discussion between her and Susan Morrison, an editor of The New Yorker. The program continues with Francis Ford Coppola's ''One from the Heart'' (tomorrow), Akira Kurosawa's ''Ran'' (Sunday), Otto Preminger's ''Anatomy of a Murder'' (Monday) and Richard Fleischer's ''Boston Strangler''(Wednesday). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. APOLLO SUNSHINE (Wednesday and Thursday) The tunefulness of folk-rock and the Beatles goes joyously off the rails in the songs of this Boston band, which tends to get more raucously enthusiastic somewhere around the second verse. Wednesday at 8 p.m., with Maplewood, Inouk and Vampire Weekend, at the Annex, 152 Orchard Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 673-3410, theannexnyc.com; $8. Thursday at 9 p.m., with Self Righteous Brothers and Up the Empire, at Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $10. (Jon Pareles) THE BIRD AND THE BEE (Monday) This Los Angeles duo toys with two fashionable ideas: retro French pop glittering with electronics, and ''Sex and the City''-style sexual conundrums, as the singer Inara George mulls the ways of noncommittal boyfriends and promises in a catwalk soprano -- to herself or a man, it's never clear -- ''I would be so winning, so absolutely winning.'' Monday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Ben Sisario) 'BROADWAY BY THE YEAR: THE MUSICALS OF 1928' (Monday) ''The Cradle Will Rock,'' ''Hellzapoppin,' '' ''The Boys From Syracuse'' and other shows from 1928 get the oh-what-a-time treatment in the latest installment of Town Hall's series, with Christiane Noll, Sarah Uriarte Berry, Hugh Panaro and Barbara Walsh. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $40 to $50. (Sisario) * JUDY COLLINS (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) What Ms. Collins brings to a song is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $100 cover at tables, $65 at the bar. (Stephen Holden) DALEK (Tuesday) Dalek is a hip-hop trio from Newark led by a rapper of the same name, who intones apocalyptic rhymes over noisy, atmospheric backing tracks. With Destructo Swarmbots, Alex Delivery and Psychic Paramount. At 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario) Baby Jane Dexter (Tonight and tomorrow night) The theme of addiction, of someone being pursued by all sorts of demons, runs through the intelligent but disturbing show by this singer, whose pop-gospel voice projects strength, solidity and a heartiness that runs counter to the songs' images of people in thrall to fantasy. At 8, Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden) ROB DICKINSON (Wednesday) In the '90s Mr. Dickinson led the Catherine Wheel, a British band that created a muscular, dramatic sweep with fogs of guitar noise. He has since refashioned himself as a cynical balladeer in the Warren Zevon mode, the kind who may or may not be sarcastic when saying that the secret to life is merely ''to smile and hang out with intelligent people.'' At 7 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (866) 468-7619, lunalounge.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) THE DOUBLE (Tonight) Something is always intriguingly askew in the songs of this local band: jagged guitars, David Greenhill's neurotic sing-speak vocals, the asymmetric gurglings of its Vox Continental organ. But the oblique lines come together in unexpected and sometimes hauntingly beautiful ways. Tonight the band will preview songs from a new album. At 7:30 and 10, Monkey Town, 58 North Third Street, between Kent and Wythe Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-1369, monkeytownhq.com; $8, with a $10 minimum. (Sisario) J. J. GREY AND MOFRO (Thursday) A singer and guitarist from Jacksonville, Fla., who grows organic vegetables when not on the road, J. J. Grey uses a rich, funky swamp blues to mourn the erosion of rural values and celebrate life's most fundamental joys (''Glory, glory hallelujah/I'm alive and I'm feeling fine''). With Virginia Coalition. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) KILLSWITCH ENGAGE, DRAGONFORCE (Thursday) Killswitch Engage, from Massachusetts, churns those machine-gun metal guitars like the best of them, but also gets bravely mushy: ''I'll be waiting for the end of my broken heart,'' sings Howard Jones in a line that, were it not surrounded by biochemical noise, could have come from the wispiest emo boy. DragonForce, a six-man metal army from London, sounds like some combination of Iron Maiden and Yngwie Malmsteen on frantic fast-forward: all the chant-along major-key melodies and fretboard-tickling guitar solos of those '80s metal heroes are there, but sped up to an exhilarating (and comical) degree. With Chimaira and He Is Legend. At 6:45 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $26 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) * LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Tonight and tomorrow night) Having expanded greatly from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like, this series ends its ninth season with two young women whose programs exemplify its growth. Tonight is Neko Case, whose supple, powerful alto is just as eloquent in spunky indie-rock or the most somber country. Tomorrow the ever-classy Jane Monheit sings standards. Tonight at 8:30 and 10:30, and tomorrow night at 8:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; sold out. (Sisario) JOHN MAYER (Wednesday) When recently crowned one of the 20 new guitar gods by Rolling Stone, this 29-year-old from Bridgeport, Conn., told the magazine, ''I want my guitar to sound like Sting's voice -- thick, on the bottom.'' He might have added elegant like Eric Clapton and nimbly funky like Curtis Mayfield. After some smooth if colorless hits early in his career, Mr. Mayer has pushed himself to develop his every musical muscle, and his latest album, ''Continuum'' (Columbia), is solid and deceptively easygoing, with worries about aging and the powerlessness of youth. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-7171, thegarden.com; $45 and $55. (Sisario) * MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE (Tonight) The first emo band to embrace the bombast and drama of the rock opera, this New Jersey five-piece mingles fist-pumping stadium rock with sickly, Brechtian theatrics on its album ''The Black Parade'' (Reprise). It follows a tradition laid out by Green Day, Marilyn Manson and Pink Floyd, but does those bands one better by scoring a cameo from Liza Minnelli. With Rise Against. At 8, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $27.25. (Sisario) EL PELE (Tonight) This Gypsy singer from Córdoba, Spain, best known for his recordings in the 1980s with Vicente Amigo, makes his American debut as part of the New York Flamenco Festival. At 8, Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, worldmusicinstitute.org; $42 and $50. (Sisario) * ELVIS PERKINS (Thursday) Having firmly established himself on the singer-songwriter circuit with a discursive acoustic style derived from groups like Clem Snide, Mr. Perkins has finally released his bittersweet and beautiful debut album, ''Ash Wednesday'' (XL). He began it in 2002, a decade after his father, the actor Anthony Perkins, died of AIDS, and a year after his mother, the fashion photographer Berry Berenson Perkins, perished on Sept. 11 in one of the planes that was crashed into the World Trade Center. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; sold out. (Sisario) EL PERRO DEL MAR (Thursday) The words ''be-bop-a-lula'' have never been sung with such plaintive fragility as when cooed by Sarah Assbring, a multitasking Swedish singer who records as El Perro del Mar. Her self-titled new album is a sweet and meticulous girl-group production for the Bjork age, with ''sha-la-la'' choruses echoing eerily as Ms. Assbring murmurs, ''This loneliness ain't pretty no more.'' She begins her first United States tour at the Bowery Ballroom, with Marissa Nadler and Chris Garneau opening the show. At 8 p.m., 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Thursday) An eloquent wiseguy whose songs evoke Bob Dylan and Paul Westerberg, Mr. Reilly, a former bellhop and gravedigger from Chicago, has the kind of high-energy, hook-heavy folk-rock sound that turns every head in a bar, while his nasal vocals are unsparingly sardonic: ''The friends that you rely on are the train tracks that you lie on.'' At 9 p.m., Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660, mopitkins.com; $15. (Sisario) SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR (Tonight) Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 26-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and ''Mbube,'' the Zulu song better known as ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight''), alongside gospel messages. At 10, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Pareles) SPARKLEHORSE (Wednesday) Sunny, Beatlesesque melodies have to bubble through a melancholic film of entropy and electronic fuzz in the songs of Sparklehorse's Mark Linkous, a talented and troubled songwriter from Richmond, Va., whose languid fantasies have an endearing tendency to include horses, metaphorical and otherwise. With Jesse Sykes and the Sweet Hereafter. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $22. (Sisario) * Sandy Stewart and Bill Charlap (Tonight and tomorrow night) The style of this mother-son team is minimalist. Where conventional voice-and-piano duos follow a formula in which the music swells at dramatic moments, Ms. Stewart and Mr. Charlap use pauses, silences, and hushed moments to bring out the interior lives of songs. At 9 and 11:30, Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $65 dinner charge at 9; $25 minimum at 11:30. (Holden) TIBET HOUSE BENEFIT (Monday) The 17th annual concert for Tibet House, an organization in New York that has among its aims housing a library and art collection for eventual repatriation, features Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson, Sigur Ros, Ray Davies, Deborah Harry, Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Michael Stipe and Ben Harper. At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $85. (Sisario) * TRANS AM, ONEIDA (Tomorrow) Long live weird rock. As part of the Knitting Factory's strangely underhyped 20th-anniversary celebration (not to be confused with the Town Hall show that invokes the club's name), the Chicago band Trans Am, which plays tightly coiled, retro-futuristic electronic rock like a band stuck in the light matrix of ''Tron,'' plays two sets with Brooklyn's beloved Oneida, whose drums, keyboards and guitar converge into powerful, pulsating drones. At 6:45 and 10:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) YOUNG LOVE (Wednesday) Dan Keyes, the skinny cherub who records as Young Love, is the latest indie rocker in the wake of the Killers to discover the dance floor. His debut, ''Too Young to Fight It'' (Island), enthusiastically follows a familiar if still fruitful formula: chunky guitar riffs plus kitschy synthesizers, high-adrenaline beats and lyrics like ''If you get the chance/You must dance, dance, dance.'' At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. GERI ALLEN TRIO (Wednesday) ''Timeless Portraits and Dreams'' (Telarc) showcases Geri Allen's sleek pianism in a number of settings, including one with a vocal chorus. She revisits some of that material in a trio with her longtime associate Darryl Hall on bass and the venerable Jimmy Cobb on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Nate Chinen) BROOKLYN QAWWALI PARTY (Tomorrow) The Sufi devotional music of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan provides a repertory mandate for this ensemble. Faithful to its source mainly in terms of exuberance, the group creates a storm of percussion, horns, harmonium and guitars. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $12, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) TAYLOR HO BYNUM AND TOMAS FUJIWARA (Tuesday) On ''True Events'' (482 Music), a scintillating album due out next week, Mr. Bynum, a cornetist, and Mr. Fujiwara, a drummer, engage in a duologue crackling with improvisational energy but guided by compositional prescription. At 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) * FRANK CARLBERG (Tonight) Mr. Carlberg is a pianist and composer enamored of language, as he demonstrates on his most recent album, ''State of the Union'' (Fresh Sound New Talent). For the premiere of ''The American Dream,'' a 12-part song cycle based on the poetry of Robert Creeley, Mr. Carlberg enlists his gifted regular collaborators: Christine Correa on vocals, Chris Cheek on tenor saxophone, John Hebert on bass and Michael Sarin on drums. At 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, Ext. 344, rmanyc.org; $20. (Chinen) * MARILYN CRISPELL TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Marilyn Crispell, a pianist equally celebrated for aggressive atonality and delicate lyricism, regroups with the bassist Mark Helias and the drummer Paul Motian, the same team as on her exquisite album ''Storyteller'' (ECM), from a few years ago. (Through March 4.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

In a preceding set, at 8, Mr. Smith performs duets with Andrea Parkins on accordion. At 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) LIBERTY ELLMAN (Tomorrow) Mr. Ellman, a guitarist and composer with a taste for rhythmic convolutions, leads a dynamic trio with Stephan Crump on bass and Gerald Cleaver on drums. At midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) THE FOUR BAGS (Sunday) The instrumental palette of the Four Bags -- Brian Drye on trombone, Jacob Garchik on accordion, Sean Moran on guitar and Mike McGinnis on reeds -- suggests a contemporary species of chamber jazz. For this performance, part of the Brooklyn Next Festival, they welcome a guest vocalist, Judith Berkson. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) THE FRINGE + ZARTH (Tonight) The Fringe, a Boston institution for more than 30 years, conjoins the tenor saxophonist George Garzone, the drummer Bob Gulloti and the bassist John Lockwood in unscripted improvisation. Here the group takes on a second bassist, Garth Stevenson, and drummer, Ziv Ravitz.

(Chinen) JAVON JACKSON (Tonight through Sunday night) Mr. Jackson, a tenor saxophonist with a relaxed, rhythmic approach, has lately favored backbeat-girded groove.

Opera * 'EUGENE ONEGIN' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The dynamic conductor Valery Gergiev and the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky bring stylistic authority to the Metropolitan Opera's revival of its 1997 production of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin.'' Mr. Hvorostovsky is riveting in the title role, singing with earthy richness and fully conveying this worldly, entitled and dashing young man's aloofness. The surprises come from the soprano Renée Fleming, in her first Russian role at the Met, who gives a vocally exquisite and vulnerable portrayal of Tatiana, and the tenor Ramón Vargas, a bel canto specialist, who makes an ardent and endearing Lenski. You will seldom see better acting in opera. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'IPHIGÉNIE EN AULIDE' (Tonight) The opera productions at the Juilliard School have generally been thoughtfully staged and vocally polished. The school is also judicious in its repertory choices. ''Iphigénie en Aulide'' has much to recommend it, as Gluck's dramatically focused and supremely lyrical operas invariably do. The cast for Robin Guarino's production includes Tharanga Goonetilleke in the title role, with Paul LaRosa as Agamemnon, Faith Sherman as Clytemnestra and Paul Appleby as Achille, with Ari Pelto conducting. At 8, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free.

(Bernard Holland) 'SIMON BOCCANEGRA' (Tonight and Tuesday night) A strong cast led by Angela Gheorghiu, Thomas Hampson, Ferruccio Furlanetti and Marcello Giordani and conducted by a fairly volcanic conductor named Fabio Luisi continues the Met's run of this dark, convoluted and often beautiful opera. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $295 tickets remaining tonight; $15 to $275 on Tuesday. (Holland) 'THÉRÈSE RAQUIN' (Tonight through Sunday) Six years after its premiere, this work by Tobias Picker is finally having its first New York performances, by the Dicapo Opera, in a reduced version for chamber orchestra. But opera tends to romanticize its subjects, and Mr. Picker's librettist, Gene Scheer, certainly does, turning the stultifying bourgeois characters that surround Thérèse into heart-of-gold stereotypes. Still, the vocal writing is grateful, and the story is reasonably compelling: the best moment is the reappearance of Camille, the murdered husband, as a ghost. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Anne Midgette) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tomorrow) The revival of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberflöte'' continues at the Met, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. James Levine conducts a cast that includes Lisa Milne as Pamina, Cornelia Götz as Queen of the Night, Michael Schade as Pamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno, Eike Wilm Schulte as the Speaker, and Vitalij Kowaljow as Sarastro. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $150 to $295 tickets remaining.

In a recital devoted to the works, the singing violin lines, taken by Jaime Laredo, will be balanced out by the masterly pianist Leon Fleisher. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $54. (Midgette) NEW WORLD SYMPHONY (Tuesday and Wednesday) Michael Tilson Thomas has done wonders with this Florida-based national youth orchestra, and he will show off its strengths (ideally) with an all-Shostakovich program that includes the Cello Concerto No. 2, with Yo-Yo Ma as the soloist. In a ''Discovery'' program on Wednesday, Mr. Thomas offers insights into Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, which the orchestra performs again. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $129 on Tuesday; $10 to $35 on Wednesday.

(Holland) PEOPLE'S COMMISSIONING FUND CONCERT/BANG ON A CAN ALL-STARS (Thursday) However democratic the process of commissioning music, the idea of doing so with a fund gathered from donations of as little as $5 is appealing, and Bang on a Can's annual concert can be counted on to generate electricity and excitement. The main focus this year may not be the three hot young composers Lukas Ligeti, Joshua Penman and Stefan Weisman, but a hot established one, Meredith Monk, who will be a guest and join in performances of five works of her own. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $20 in advance; $25 at the door.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: MARTíN RAMíREZ, through April 29. Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040.

This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith) * Asia Society: Glass, Gilding, and Grand Design: Art of Sasanian Iran (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. This glinting, glowing show is a reduction of a much larger Paris exhibition that included material from Iranian museums impossible to bring to the United States. But with some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, it is still substantial and the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400. (Holland Cotter) * Grey Art Gallery: 'Semina Culture: Wallace Berman & His Circle,' through March 31. The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) may ring only a faint bell to many New Yorkers, but he was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780. (Cotter) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. This show sounds ripe with possibilities. The results, however, are more mixed. The exhibition is drawn from the museum's collection, which explains some of its exclusions and limitations. Many artists you associate with contemporary photography and the family are not in attendance: Richard Bellingham, Tina Barney, Malerie Marder. There is also a sense of false advertising in the exhibition's title. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. A good portion of the work falls under this rubric. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children (now grown), has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, and her choice of family as the central focus of artistic practice, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) International Center of Photography: 'Henri Cartier-Bresson's Scrapbook: Photographs, 1932-46,' through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It's an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * The METropOlitan museum of art: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) * Morgan Library & Museum: 'Private Treasures: Four Centuries of European Master Drawings,' through April 8. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The works span more than 400 years, from the 16th to the early 20th century, and include drawings in ink and pencil, watercolor, chalk and gouache. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn't an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one's craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example -- and the most historically significant work here -- is a black chalk drawing, ''The Dead Christ'' (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don't know where they came from, where they're going, or when you'll see them again. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Schwendener) Museum of Modern Art: 'Artistic Collaborations: 50 Years of Universal Limited Art Editions,' through May 21. This exhibition marks the half-century milestone for Universal Limited Art Editions in West Islip, N.Y., and its association with the Museum of Modern Art: The museum has acquired one print from every edition made at Universal, more than 1,200 works by nearly 50 artists. Prints by 12 artists are in this show. Among them are lithographs by Jasper Johns, mostly from the 1960s, with his signature maps and flags. Robert Rauschenberg is represented primarily by lithographs from the 1960s that combine found images of figures like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson with the freehand scrawling associated with Abstract Expressionism. It's hard to fault an exhibition that features prints by masters like Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg. But given the somewhat precarious position of prints in the contemporary art world, the inclusion of younger artists would make a good argument that traditional printmaking is still relevant and holds possibilities for this generation. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener) * MOMA: Armando ReverÓn, through April 16. Unless you spotted his single smoke-puff of a painting at MoMA months ago, Armando Reverón probably means nothing to you. Why should he? The artist, who died in 1954, spent most of his life in a shack by the sea in his native Venezuela. Many of his contemporaries dismissed him as nuts. His white-on-white pictures are practically unphotographable. But chances are that if you visit this retrospective, you'll find yourself thinking about him a lot. His art and his story are like few others, and so is the museum's inspired installation: a single, long corridor with cabinetlike rooms of paintings on either side and, at the very end, against a sea-green wall, a life-size doll with giant bat wings floating overhead. (See above.) (Cotter) * National Academy Museum: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this brave if confused exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show's 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins, mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith) Neuberger Museum of Art: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77, through June 24. This artist is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn't stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, print-making, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea * Fredericks & Freiser: BAKER OVERSTREET: NEW PAINTINGS, through March 17. Like Keegan McHargue and Devendra Banhart, this young artist has a penchant for tribal motifs, which he flattens into symmetrical compositions and renders with an outsider roughness. The works in his debut show evoke the imagery of the space-ship-obsessed, self-taught artist Ionel Talpazan, as well as Alfred Jensen and Forrest Bess. Their notion of the visionary is both self conscious and familiar, but they are painted with energetic dispatch and a sure sense of scale, color and wit that encourages you to stay tuned. 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555. (Smith) Last Chance * Ceres: Agents of Change: Women, Art, and Intellect In a gathering wave of feminist shows this season, this one is a modest-size, timely arrival. Organized by the artist Leslie King-Hammond, with an immaculate installation by Lowery Stokes Sims, it's a multiethnic, multi-generational pick of work by 19 artists spanning some 40 years. If there's a theme, it's a loose one: feminist art happened, in many forms; it is still happening, in many forms. 547 West 27th Street, Suite 201, Chelsea, (212) 947-6100; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) Chambers Fine Art: QIU ZHIJIE: THE SHAPE OF TIME Chinese calligraphy and landscape painting are rendered postmodern in 24 large color photographs that document the performance-writing (at night, with a flashlight, before a time-lapse camera) of characters for the solar markers of the Chinese year. The haunting results resemble elegant, disembodied neon and are suspended (along with blurred hints of the artist himself) in settings where old China meets new. 210 Eleventh Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-1169; closes tomorrow. (Smith) China Institute: 'Shu: Reinventing Books in Contemporary Chinese' This second installation of a two-part show glances back at the period of artistic expansion in the 1970s, and its contraction, when the Communist Party clamped down on free expression after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Qiu Zhijie's photographic ''library,'' which papers the walls of the China Institute's main staircase, makes evident the information explosion in the '80s. Among the thousands of titles are Chinese classics, books on natural sciences, and treatises by Plato, Disraeli and Harold Bloom, as well as art books on Indian stupa, Japanese manga and Barbara Kruger. Such a trove might have been considered a treasure before Tiananmen Square; afterward, such resources became sources of angst. The figure that appears throughout Zhang Xiaogang's 1991 series ''Private Notes,'' for example, looks as if he is losing his mind as he struggles to write letters and decode illegible manuscripts. Without easy access to words, the images imply, there can be no such thing as free expression. 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org; closes tomorrow. (Bridget L. Goodbody) * Danziger Projects: Seydou Keita and Lolo Veleko The great Malian photographer Seydou Keita, who died in 2001, gave us modern Bamako in his black-and-white studio portraits. The young South African photographer Lolo Veleko, a star of ''Snap Judgments'' at the International Center of Photography last year, gives us contemporary Johannesburg, in fabulous color, in hers. 521 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 629-6778; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) Momenta Art: ELISABETH KLEY A fascination with drag stars like the filmmaker Jack Smith and the Warhol regular Candy Darling and, it would seem, their relationship to the exotic and to non-Western decorative traditions fuels this dense show of collaged ink drawings and sly majolica ceramic vessels. Preening peacocks are another point of departure, and the plethora of eyes, whether in the portraits, the tail feathers or the glazes, creates a watchful intensity that turns the traditional straight, Western gaze back on itself. 359 Bedford Avenue, near South Fourth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-8058; through Monday. (Smith) * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913' Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Behind the dining room is a huge vitrine fitted out with a dazzling variety of Hoffmann-designed useful and decorative objects; other showcases display larger works. Though focused on interiors, the show conveys the basic ideas of a designer immersed in a new vision. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org; closes on Monday. (Glueck) Storefront for Art and Architecture: 'Clip/Stamp/Fold' This show examines the world of small magazines from the early 1960s to the end of the 1970s, when the field of architecture was still marked by a playful intellectual and political independence. It's packed with gorgeous cover images, from copulating robots to an elephant attacking the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan to a skyscraper made of Swiss cheese. Often thrown together on a shoestring budget, the magazines have an intoxicating freshness that should send a shudder down the spine of those who've spent the last decade bathed in the glow of the computer screen. But this is not an exercise in nostalgia. It's a piercing critique, intended or not, of the smoothness of our contemporary design culture. These magazine covers map out an era when architecture was simmering with new ideas. You're bound to leave the show with a nagging sense of what was lost as well as gained during the electronic juggernaut of the last three decades. 97 Kenmare Street, between Mulberry and Lafayette Streets, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org; closes tomorrow.

VA Cambria Heights man was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to 12 years in prison for injuring a police officer during a struggle in June 2005, prosecutors said. The man, Lasana Philbert, 23, of 229th Street, was convicted last month of assault on a police officer, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said Mr. Philbert struggled with Officer Christopher Wiesneski, 32, as the officer tried to arrest him after he spotted him with marijuana. During the struggle, Mr. Brown said, Mr. Philbert grabbed the officer\u2019s pistol, which discharged, striking Officer Wiesneski in the leg.

VA Cambria Heights man was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to 12 years in prison for injuring a police officer during a struggle in June 2005, prosecutors said. The man, Lasana Philbert, 23, of 229th Street, was convicted last month of assault on a police officer, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said Mr. Philbert struggled with Officer Christopher Wiesneski, 32, as the officer tried to arrest him after he spotted him with marijuana. During the struggle, Mr. Brown said, Mr. Philbert grabbed the officer's pistol, which discharged, striking Officer Wiesneski in the leg.

VSigourney Weaver as Gypsy Rose Lee Gypsy Rose Lee is coming to the little screen, and Sigourney Weaver (''Alien''), right, will portray her, Variety.com reported. The vehicle is ''Gypsy and Me,'' based on the memoir ''My G-String Mother: At Home and Backstage With Gypsy Rose Lee.'' The book was written by Ms. Lee's son, Erik Lee Preminger, who was 12 when he became her stage manager. The HBO film, with a script by Martin Sherman (''Mrs. Henderson Presents''), will deal with the final phase of Ms. Lee's striptease career, in the 1950s, when she decided that she was too old (her birth year has been given as 1911 and 1914) to disrobe before strangers. Instead, she maintained her fame and luxurious lifestyle by becoming a best-selling author and seeing her life story made into a musical. Tintin Goes to Hollywood Tintin, left, the cartoon world's internationally popular boy reporter, is bound for a film from DreamWorks, The Associated Press reported, citing Nick Rodwell, who controls the estate of Tintin's creator, Hergé (the pseudonym of Georges Remi). Mr. Rodwell said the film, long discussed, could be in theaters in two years. It is not clear which Tintin adventure will furnish the plot of the film, Mr. Rodwell said, but ''if movie No. 1 works, we will continue.'' New Princess From Disney Maddy, a young African-American girl from the French Quarter in New Orleans, will be the heroine of a new animated musical from Walt Disney Studios. Titled ''The Frog Princess,'' the fairy-tale film, ranging from ''the heart of Louisiana's mystical bayous'' to ''the banks of the mighty Mississippi,'' will feature ''a soulful singing crocodile, voodoo spells and Cajun charm,'' the studio said. The film will be based on an original story by John Musker and Ron Clements (''The Little Mermaid,'' ''Aladdin''), who will both direct. The Oscar-winner Randy Newman (''Toy Story,'' ''Cars''), who spent his childhood in New Orleans, will provide the songs and score. Pope No Dylan Fan In 1997, when Pope Benedict XVI was still Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, he opposed plans for Bob Dylan to perform at a concert for youth in Bologna, Italy, Reuters reported. In his new book, ''John Paul II, My Beloved Predecessor,'' Pope Benedict writes without further explanation, ''There was reason to be skeptical -- I was, and in a certain sense I still am -- to doubt if it was really right to let these types of prophets intervene.'' He mentions only Dylan among the stars who appeared. At the concert, Mr. Dylan sang ''Knockin' on Heaven's Door,'' ''A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall'' and ''Forever Young.'' Police Say Musician Was a Speedy Traveler John Popper, 39, below, frontman and harmonica player for the 1996 Grammy Award-winning band Blues Traveler, was arrested by the Washington State Patrol on Wednesday after a black Mercedes S.U.V carrying him was clocked at 111 miles an hour, The Associated Press reported. Inside the vehicle, the patrol said, a police dog led them to hidden compartments containing four rifles, nine handguns, a switchblade knife and night goggles, as well as a small quantity of marijuana. The car was also equipped with flashing emergency headlights, a siren and a public address system. ''Popper indicated to troopers that he had installed these items because (in the event of a natural disaster) he didn't want to be left behind,'' the patrol said in a news release. Trooper Jeff Sevigney said Mr. Popper, who lives in Snohomish, Wash., owns the vehicle, which was being driven by Brian Gourgeois, 34, of Austin, Tex. Both men were released on their own recognizance. Mr. Popper did not reply immediately to an e-mail message seeking comment. Upper West Fest An all-day marathon at Symphony Space exploring highlights of 400 years of opera; a performance of ''High School Musical'' at the Jewish Community Center; a Yiddish film festival presented by the Folksbiene National Yiddish Theater; the fourth Mamapalooza Festival in Riverside Park. These are among the highlights of the Upper West Fest, sponsored by Zabar's and consisting of 50 events in film, theater, music and art, among other programs, from April 28 through May 20. Among the participants are the American Museum of Natural History, Ballet Hispanico, the Barnard College Department of Dance, the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine and the New-York Historical Society. Footnotes The Labyrinth Theater production of ''Jack Goes Boating,'' starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Ortiz, the company's artistic directors, has been extended for three weeks, through April 29. Tickets go on sale today. The production, opening officially on March 18, was scheduled to play through April 8. Andreas Delfs, above, has been appointed principal conductor of the Honolulu Symphony, beginning with the 2007-8 season, the orchestra announced. Mr. Delfs will end his tenure as music director of the Milwaukee Symphony in 2009 and become its conductor laureate. The Berlin-based Norwegian conductor Stefan Herheim has been tapped to stage a new production of Wagner's final opera, ''Parsifal,'' which will open the Bayreuth Festival in 2008, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday.

VLloyd ''Street Love'' (The Inc./Universal) Having been acquitted of money-laundering, the hip-hop mogul Irving Lorenzo, known as Irv Gotti, comes roaring -- or, more accurately, purring -- back. His label, The Inc. (formerly Murder Inc.), is releasing ''Street Love,'' the second album from the 21-year-old crooner Lloyd; Irv Gotti is listed as one of four executive producers. And Lloyd has a big hit with ''You,'' a PG seduction song, which sits atop Billboard's Hot 100 Airplay chart.

VThe Talking Business column in Business Day on Saturday, about a campaign by Patrick M. Byrne, the chief executive of Overstock.com, against a type of short selling, referred incorrectly to David Rocker, a short seller and former head of Rocker Partners. Mr. Rocker and his firm were not the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into possible manipulation of Overstock.com shares. (Mr. Rocker did testify in the course of an S.E.C. investigation of similar accusations against Gradient Analytics, a research firm. The S.E.C. recently sent a letter to Gradient saying that it would not pursue any action against the firm.).

VAn article on March 2 about the slaying of Ken Gorman, a supplier of medical marijuana in Denver, included an erroneous estimate from Allen St. Pierre, the executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, on the number of legal marijuana providers who have been killed nationally. Mr. St. Pierre says he can only verify six killings since 2003, not the 20 since 1997 that he earlier estimated.

VThe Green Bay Packers signed the free-agent cornerback Frank Walker to a one-year deal that could be worth nearly $1.5 million with incentives, his agent, Harold Lewis, said yesterday. Walker spent the past four seasons with the Giants. In other N.F.L. news, Lance Briggs reiterated that he would not play another down for the Bears after they designated him as their franchise player, and the free-agent cornerback Nick Harper left the Colts to sign a three-year deal with the Tennessee Titans. Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens was accused of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-16 White House Expects Delay In Reaching Key Iraq Goals Bush administration officials acknowledge that their key political goals for Iraq will take longer than they anticipated and say that the troop buildup intended to stabilize Baghdad will not be completed until June. A1 Facing opposition from the Bush administration, the Senate began debate over an Iraq exit strategy and headed toward a vote on a Democratic resolution to pull out American combat troops in 2008. A14 If Clinton Is Elected ... In an interview, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said that if elected president she would keep a reduced but significant military force in Iraq to fight Al Qaeda, deter Iranian aggression and possibly support the Iraqi military. A1 Britain Renews Atomic Arsenal Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain faced down a mutiny in Parliament, winning a vote to renew Britain's nuclear arsenal only with the support of opposition lawmakers. A8 A Caveat in North Korea Deal The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency said that North Korea had pledged to honor its commitment to dismantle its nuclear arms program only after sanctions had been lifted on its funds frozen in a bank in Macao since 2005. A8 NATIONAL A18-25 Bush Backs Gonzales But Expresses Discontent President Bush said that he had confidence in Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales but that he was ''frankly not happy about'' the way Mr. Gonzales handled the dismissal of federal prosecutors. The move has spawned a Congressional investigation into whether the White House allowed politics to interfere with law enforcement. A1 Better Treatment on Weekdays A study of nearly all heart attack patients in New Jersey finds that those who arrived at a hospital on a weekend were less likely to receive aggressive treatment and were slightly more likely to die than those who arrived on weekdays, researchers are reporting. A25 Appeal Lost in Marijuana Case Appellate judges in San Francisco ruled that a terminally ill woman using marijuana was not immune from prosecution simply because of her condition. In a separate case, a federal judge dismissed most of the charges against a prominent advocate for the drug. A18 Coast Guard Pulls Out of Deal The Coast Guard said it was canceling a contract with two military contractors to develop a vessel for a wide range of missions in the post-9/11 world and would instead have the Coast Guard's own acquisition branch handle the project. A25 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Gunfight in the Village Leaves 4 People Dead Two unarmed auxiliary police officers were fatally shot last night during a chase with a gunman in Greenwich Village, the authorities said. Regular police officers later shot and killed the gunman, who had earlier killed a bartender, the police said. A1 Charges Mar Officer's Career Lt. William White collected a string of accolades during his four-decade career on the New Haven police force. Now, he faces charges of stealing and taking bribes -- charges that a judge said would most likely spell a ''dismal end'' to his career. B1 BUSINESS DAY C1-14 New Warnings for Sleep Aids The Food and Drug Administration announced strong new warning labels for 13 prescription sleeping pills. Drugs such as Ambien and Lunesta may cause strange behavior. A1 Business Digest C2 EDITORIAL A26-27 Editorials: Immigration misery; China's sort of congress; homeowners at risk; General Pace and gay soldiers. Columns: David Brooks, Bob Herbert.

VA former city police officer pleaded guilty yesterday in Federal District Court to drug trafficking charges, federal prosecutors said. The former officer, Jose Torrado, admitted helping his brother distribute large quantities of cocaine and marijuana in the New York area from 2002 to 2005, said Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney in Manhattan. Mr. Torrado, 31, of the Bronx, joined the Police Department in 2001 and resigned in 2006 as a result of the investigation, Mr. Garcia said. He added that while Mr. Torrado served as a police officer, he worked with a group that smuggled drugs from Mexico to New York in trucks.

VTwo Border Patrol agents examining packages of marijuana that had floated ashore along the Rio Grande were fired upon by unseen assailants on the Mexican side of the river, the authorities said. The agents, who returned fire, were not injured, and there was no sign that their bullets had struck anyone, said Oscar Saldana, a Border Patrol spokesman. It was the second such episode this year along a narrow part of the Rio Grande near Donna, about 13 miles northeast of McAllen. Mr. Saldana said the shooting was most likely a response by drug smugglers to the Border Patrol\u2019s more intensive searches of the area.

VThe State House passed a measure intended to stop businesses from selling lollipops, gumdrops and other candies flavored with hempseed oil to taste like marijuana. The measure passed by a vote of 133 to 26 and now moves to the Senate. Marketers say the treats, which have drug-inspired names like Kronic Kandy and Pot Suckers, are a harmless novelty, and many advise retailers to sell the candy only to customers 18 or older. The legislation says the candies promote drug use and give children the \u201cfalse impression that marijuana is fun and safe\u201d; it would ban sales of the candies to minors and impose fines of up to $1,000 for each offense. Vote Hemp, a national organization that promotes the use of hemp products, said the measure would make Georgia the first state to ban the sale of the candy to minors. Sales have already been banned in Alameda County, Calif.; Chicago; and Suffolk County, N.Y.

VA man who was awaiting trial in the March 2006 death of his infant son has died, apparently in a suicide, his lawyer and jail officials said yesterday. The boy, Eric Rivera, died after being shaken, and the authorities said the father, Julio Rivera, 26, had blown PCP-laced marijuana in his face. Mr. Rivera was found hanging from a sheet shortly before midnight on Monday, said Chief Alan Otto of the Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Department.

VBASKETBALL DAVIS TO LEAVE L.S.U. -- Louisiana State center Glen Davis, known as Big Baby, said yesterday that he would skip his senior year to enter the N.B.A. draft. Davis, a 6-foot-9, 290-pound junior, will remain enrolled at L.S.U. until the end of the semester. The N.B.A.'s predraft camp is May 28-June 5 in Orlando, Fla., and Davis expects to be there. He averaged 17.7 points and 10.4 rebounds this season. He is the only L.S.U. player other than Shaquille O'Neal with more than 1,500 points, 900 rebounds and 100 blocked shots. LONG BEACH STATE DROPS COACH -- Long Beach State will not bring back Coach Larry Reynolds next season, deciding to let his contract expire even though he led the 49ers to the N.C.A.A. tournament this season for the first time in a 12 years. Reynolds's five-year contract was set to end on April 22. ''We had a banner season, but upon an extensive review, I came to the conclusion that a foundation had not been built to ensure long-term success,'' Athletic Director Vic Cegles said. FAIRFIELD WOMEN'S COACH RESIGNS -- Dianne Nolan, Fairfield's longtime women's coach, announced her resignation yesterday. Nolan posted a 456-359 record in her 28-year tenure with the Stags, during which the program upgraded to Division I from Division III. She led them to one Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference title and four appearances in the N.C.A.A. tournament, the most recent in 2001. BASEBALL BLUFFTON TO PLAY ON -- Bluffton University will play baseball this season after a bus crash in Atlanta killed five team members. The team will wear all-black uniforms to honor the victims. Phill Talavinia, the college's athletic director, said discussions were under way about a memorial. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) FOOTBALL STOKLEY AGREES TO BRONCOS DEAL -- The former Indianapolis Colts receiver Brandon Stokley has agreed to a one-year free-agent deal with the Denver Broncos. Stokley's agent, Rick Smith, confirmed the contract yesterday. Stokley, who played in only four games last season because of knee and ankle injuries, was released March 2 by the Colts. He also visited New Orleans before agreeing to the Broncos' offer. In other news, Adam Archuleta's days with the Redskins ended last night when he was traded to the Bears for a sixth-round draft pick. SEATTLE WON'T KEEP STEVENS -- Jerramy Stevens's days with the Seahawks are done, Seattle General Manager Tim Ruskell said. Stevens, a tight end, is an unrestricted free agent who spent his first five seasons with the team. He was recently arrested for investigation of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana in Scottsdale, Ariz. CHEMOTHERAPY FOR DAVIS -- North Carolina Coach Butch Davis is having chemotherapy after a dentist removed a cancerous growth from his mouth. Davis said he was not aware he had a growth when he saw his dentist late last month in Cleveland for a routine cleaning. After the growth was removed, a biopsy diagnosed it as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Later exams found no evidence that the cancer had spread. ''We're going to get through this and we're going to have a great season next fall,'' Davis said. CRICKET NEW ZEALAND AND SOUTH AFRICA ADVANCE -- New Zealand and top-ranked South Africa advanced to the second round of the World Cup yesterday with their second victories. South Africa's victory also sealed defending champion Australia's place among the last eight. South Africa reached the so-called Super Eight stage after recording a seven-wicket victory against Scotland with more than 26 of its allotted 50 overs to spare. The Kiwis defeated Kenya by 148 runs in St. Lucia. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) COACH'S DEATH CALLED SUSPICIOUS -- The Jamaican police are treating the death of Pakistan Coach Bob Woolmer as suspicious, a team spokesman said last night. The team held a news conference in Kingston after an earlier briefing that post-mortem findings were inconclusive. Pervez Mir, a team spokesman, said that the Jamaican police were treating the death as suspicious. (REUTERS)

VThe State House passed a measure intended to stop businesses from selling lollipops, gumdrops and other candies flavored with hempseed oil to taste like marijuana. The measure passed by a vote of 133 to 26 and now moves to the Senate. Marketers say the treats, which have drug-inspired names like Kronic Kandy and Pot Suckers, are a harmless novelty, and many advise retailers to sell the candy only to customers 18 or older. The legislation says the candies promote drug use and give children the ''false impression that marijuana is fun and safe''; it would ban sales of the candies to minors and impose fines of up to $1,000 for each offense. Vote Hemp, a national organization that promotes the use of hemp products, said the measure would make Georgia the first state to ban the sale of the candy to minors. Sales have already been banned in Alameda County, Calif.; Chicago; and Suffolk County, N.Y.

VAn appeals court ruled that California\u2019s medical marijuana law does not automatically shield patients from searches by law enforcement. The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the State Court of Appeal said a Napa County sheriff\u2019s deputy had probable cause to search the vehicle of Gabriel Strasburg, who claimed to have a medical marijuana card, in October 2005. The law limits patient possession to eight ounces. The deputy claimed Mr. Strasburg had about 23 ounces and a scale and was smoking in a parked car. Mr. Strasburg pleaded no contest to misdemeanor possession but appealed, claiming an unlawful search. In the decision, Justice James Marchiano said the amount of marijuana found in the search left \u201ca strong suggestion\u201d that Mr. Strasburg \u201cwas using the act as a façade to conceal illegal activity.\u201d.

VPRO FOOTBALL ARCHULETA TRADED TO BEARS -- The Washington Redskins traded Adam Archuleta to the Chicago Bears yesterday, one year after making him the highest-paid safety in N.F.L. history. Archuleta, 29, earned $5.6 million last year but was benched for the second half of the season except for special teams. Archuleta became the symbol for the team's disappointing 5-11 season in 2006 after the owner Daniel Synder brought in a host of well-paid but underperforming players. SCHAUB TO REPLACE CARR -- The Houston Texans introduced quarterback Matt Schaub at a news conference yesterday, saying that he will replace David Carr. The Texans acquired Schaub in a trade with Atlanta. The teams swapped first-round picks in the coming draft; the Falcons now have the eighth pick and the Texans dropped to No. 10. Atlanta also received second-round picks in the next two drafts. General Manager Rick Smith said that the Texans were trying to trade Carr, who completed 60 percent of his passes in five seasons, but also threw 65 interceptions and was sacked 249 times. Schaub has backed up Michael Vick for the past three seasons. He threw 27 passes in 2006. FAULK RETIRING -- Running back Marshall Faulk sat out last season with a knee injury that threatened to end his career. He will close the door on his playing days Monday, when he announces his retirement at the N.F.L. owners meeting. Faulk, 34, was the league's most valuable player in 2000 and the offensive player of the year 1999-2001. NEW APPROACH TO NAMING RIGHTS -- The Jets and the Giants will divide naming rights for their new stadium into five pieces to make the price more appealing to potential buyers, Jay Cross, the Jets' president, said yesterday. Cross said that the rights to other New York sports stadiums sold for so much that the cost of naming the new N.F.L. stadium, scheduled to open in 2010, might scare off potential buyers. The Mets will get $20 million a year from Citigroup Inc. To cut the cost, the Jets and the Giants will offer the stadium's corners to four ''cornerstone partners'' and sell the right to name the entire facility to a ''naming partner,'' Cross said. He would not estimate prices. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) VICK USED BOTTLE TO HIDE JEWELRY -- Michael Vick said yesterday that the water bottle seized two months ago by authorities at Miami International Airport was a jewelry box. Vick came under scrutiny in January after the police said the bottle smelled of marijuana and had a secret compartment, but tests found no evidence of drugs. Speaking publicly for the first time since the incident, Vick said that the bottle was a hiding place for earrings and jewelry. FIGURE SKATING U.S. DANCE TEAMS IN TOP 10 -- While the United States men and pairs have stumbled at the World Figure Skating Championships, all three dance teams were in the top 10, with the Olympic silver medalists Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto leading the way. They are in third place heading into today's free dance. A half-point separated them from the leaders Albena Denkova and Maxim Staviski of Bulgaria. Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon of Canada were in second place. Meryl Davis and Charlie Whitewere were in eighth place in their first world championships as seniors. Melissa Gregory and Denis Petukhov were 10th. CRICKET NEW ZEALAND TOPS CANADA -- Lou Vincent scored his third one-day international century to help New Zealand to a 114-run win against Canada at the World Cup, while the Netherlands beat Scotland. Vincent made 101 in New Zealand's 363-5 victory from 50 overs in Gros Islet, St. Lucia, before Canada was restricted to 249-9 in its reply. The Kiwis have secured a spot in the second round. HOCKEY RICHTER NOT RUNNING -- Mike Richter, the retired Rangers goalie, has decided not to run for Congress in Connecticut against the Republican Representative Chris Shays, a Democratic Party leader said yesterday. Richter, a 40-year-old Democrat who lives in Guilford, said last month that he was considering a run for the Fairfield County seat in 2008. Nancy DiNardo, the state Democratic chairwoman, said Richter told her Wednesday that he had decided not to run. ''It was personal reasons,'' DiNardo said. ''He just feels it's not the right time for him now.''

An honors student with a 3.8 average here in northwestern New Jersey, she wasn't being summoned to discuss her academic performance.

VKRISTIN SOMERS was sitting in her 10th-grade English class at Hackettstown High last year when a call came over the intercom telling her to report to the office. Immediately. An honors student with a 3.8 average here in northwestern New Jersey, she wasn't being summoned to discuss her academic performance. And while she participates in an array of after-school organizations -- from soccer and softball to the National Honor Society and Key Club -- the issue wasn't her extracurricular activities or future plans.

'BLACKBIRD' In previews; opens on April 10. Jeff Daniels stars in the United States premiere of this provocative play about a man coming to terms with a troubling relationship from his past. Joe Mantello directs (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. 'FROST/NIXON' Previews start tomorrow. Opens on April 22. As Nixon, a hunched Frank Langella grumbles his way through this acclaimed London transfer about the famous post-Watergate interview (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'INHERIT THE WIND' In previews; opens on April 12. This revival of the classic courtroom drama based on the famous ''monkey trial'' stars a lineup of heavy-hitters: Brian Dennehy, Christopher Plummer, Denis O'Hare and Byron Jennings (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'LEGALLY BLONDE' Previews start on Tuesday. Opens on April 29. Laura Bell Bundy plays the smiling, ditsy sorority girl who takes Harvard Law by storm in this musical adaptation. Jerry Mitchell directs (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' In previews; opens on April 9. Kevin Spacey and Eve Best star in the London transfer of this Eugene O'Neill classic. Howard Davies directs (3:00). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. 'REARVIEWMIRROR' Previews start tomorrow. Opens on Thursday. Inspired by ''The Bacchae,'' Eric Winick's new play is set in an outdoor rock festival (1:20). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:45). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of José Saramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jonathan Kalb) 'CHICKEN' Michael Batistick's new play about cock fighting and emasculation could benefit from subtler metaphors but manages to touch us gently even as it deploys a heavy hammer. E J Carroll, Michael Imperioli and his ''Sopranos'' castmate Sharon Angela give fine performances as struggling urban nobodies (1:45). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Ginia Bellafante) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FUGUE' ''Mary Smith'' is found wandering the streets of Chicago, suffering from amnesia. A young psychiatrist, who has his own demons, is consulted, and the process of treatment and Mary's memories in flashback are the action of ''Fugue,'' Lee Thuna's unrewarding play, directed by the Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey (2:15). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) * 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood) 'LOS ANGELES' Julian Sheppard's play about a gamin lost in a Hollywood of aimlessness and empty sex is as thin as the slip dress she keeps wearing and, presumably, taking off (1:20). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'OUR LEADING LADY' Kate Mulgrew stars as Laura Keene, who was starring in ''Our American Cousin'' the night Lincoln was shot, in Charles Busch's uneven new comedy. An occasionally lively but mostly lumpen tribute to the glamour and grit of the theatrical life of a past era (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'PROMETHEUS BOUND' With a splendid performance by David Oyelowo, this is a smart revival of Aeschylus' 2,500-year-old play, rich in poetic imagery. It still has things to say about the abuse of power by an autocratic ruler who vindictively runs roughshod over anyone who disagrees with him (1:20). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'SOME MEN' Terrence McNally's hit-and-miss comedy about gay life is a parade of cleanly drawn types, zippy one-liners and sentimental set pieces, woven into a pageant of the ages à la ''Cavalcade,'' Noel Coward's generations-spanning tribute to the British stiff upper lip. Trip Cullman directs the agile, appealing cast (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'TALL GRASS' Brian Harris's three short plays, black farces all, are not nearly as slight as any sound-bite synopsis would have them seem. Here Mr. Harris, a former stock analyst, explores the alliances formed between love and brutality in scenarios in which the tension builds to culminating shock (1:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'TEA AND SYMPATHY' The specter of the Ted Haggard scandal hangs over the Keen Company's revival of Robert Anderson's 1953 play about life in a psychologically stifling boys' boarding school. Girded by Jonathan Silverstein's skillful, understated direction, the play attains an unexpected timeliness as it evolves into a story about the dangers of sexual repression (2:00). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) 'WIDOWERS' HOUSES' An adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play, updated to 1990s Harlem, tests the limits of credibility (1:40). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) Off Off Broadway 'THE EXILES' Theodora Skipitares's rendering, with life-size puppets, music and video, of the story of Orestes, adapted from Euripides but inspired by Sartre. A short and rather slight play that continues the mining of the Trojan War for contemporary equivalents by the conceiver and director of last season's Trilogy (1:00). La MaMa Annex, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Moore) 'JACKIE WITH A Z': Delectably outrageous (1:30). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'MEN OF STEEL' This darkly comic twist on superheroes is a loony, guilty pleasure (2:00). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE DIRECTOR' A likable if naïve young woman, who is seduced by an unnamed, unseen and presumably unscrupulous film director, seeks other of his victims and tape records their experiences for no clear purpose in a play that has no clear idea of what it wants to say (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' A joyful treat (1:30). JCC in Manhattan, Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Van Gelder) * 'THE TAMING OF THE SHREW' AND 'TWELFTH NIGHT' In these boisterous and inventive productions, from the London-based all-male Propeller Company, the poetry may be pretty, but the comedy definitely is not. The director Edward Hall uncovers the baleful underbelly in Shakespearean slapstick, memorably demonstrating that boys will be brutes. (Each is 2:40.) Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE WAITING ROOM' An amusing play about some uncomfortable truths a group of friends and relatives faces while sitting in a hospital waiting room. While it has its share of laughs, it has things to say about the importance of family, even those members you might wish were not a part of it (2:00). 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Hampton) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AIR GUITAR NATION' (R, 82 minutes) Alexandra Lipsitz's breezy competition documentary follows pantomiming would-be rockers as they compete for the right to represent their country in a global championship based in Oulou, Finland. The movement, such as it is, aims to unite a war-torn planet in musical fantasy and to rawwwwwwk! -- but not necessarily in that order. Stylistically, it's nothing special, but the film's droll humor and wild performances are hard to resist. (Matt Zoller Seitz) * 'BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON' (R, 92 minutes) Scott Glosserman's mockumentary about a celebrity-seeking serial killer is sustained by rapier-sharp observations and a firmer grasp of tone than that in many more generously financed projects. Appealing more to the brain than to the gut, the movie subtly prods at the sick dance between the news media and über-criminals without belaboring its point or lowering its tone. If Christopher Guest ever turned his attention to psycho killers instead of folk singers and dog breeders, this is exactly the sort of movie he would make. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'BOY CULTURE' (No rating, 88 minutes) Q. Allan Brocka's absorbing drama follows an emotionally repressed gay hustler (Derek Magyar) as he rebels against the obsessions of his culture -- grooming, cruising, working out -- and a powerful attraction to his roommate. Only when he takes on a reclusive and much older client is he forced to pay attention to a story other than his own. (Catsoulis) 'COLOR ME KUBRICK' (No rating, 90 minutes) If it doesn't add up to more than a fitfully amusing collection of comic sketches, the fictional portrait of Alan Conway, a real-life British con man who hustled his way across England by impersonating the reclusive filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, is a platform for John Malkovich to burst into lurid purple flame. (Stephen Holden) 'DEAD SILENCE' (R, 90 minutes) In this new film from the makers of the ''Saw'' series, a young man (Ryan Kwanten) whose wife was murdered by a demonic ventriloquist's dummy returns to his hometown to unravel the roots of a century-old curse. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies. (Seitz) 'EXTERMINATING ANGELS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in French) The French director Jean-Claude Brisseau's film is a piece of highbrow smut about a French filmmaker directing a piece of highbrow smut. A must for fans of highbrow smut. No complaints here. (A. O. Scott) 'FIRST SNOW' (R, 101 minutes) Guy Pearce, in his ''Memento'' mode, is a fast-talking salesman in this moody little thriller, which asks metaphysical questions about fate, death and fortunetelling. (Holden) 'THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2' (R, 89 minutes) Wes Craven's 1977 film, ''The Hills Have Eyes,'' in which suburbanites battled mutant cannibals, was a pulpy parable of the thin line separating civilization from savagery. Last year's remake was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up, in which National Guard trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout, is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video. (Seitz) * 'THE HOST' (R, 119 minutes, in Korean) A loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid -- part carnival of horrors, part family melodrama -- about the demons that haunt us from without and within. The talented South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho directs his monster and humans with equal flair. (Manohla Dargis) 'I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE' (R, 94 minutes) An unusually smart and brisk comedy of marital frustration and sexual temptation, based on Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon,'' with Chris Rock (who directed and is co-author of the script) as a Manhattan investment banker distracted by the charms of a bombshell played by the wonderful Kerry Washington. (Scott) * 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' (No rating, 162 minutes, in English and Latin) Philip Gröning's documentary about the lives of Carthusian monks living in a valley in the French Alps is slow, quiet and utterly spellbinding for the way it conveys the experience of spiritual devotion in simple, lovely images. (Scott) * 'JOURNEY FROM THE FALL' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Vietnamese and English) The writer and director Ham Tran's film is a sprawling tearjerker about a war-splintered South Vietnamese family trying to survive the aftermath of the United States withdrawal, then seek a new life in America. Set amid the chaos of late-'70s Vietnam, when the victorious North set about ''re-educating'' the shattered South, ''Journey'' recounts one family's endurance in a sturdy, old-movie style, with sweeping camerawork, a monumental and occasionally intrusive orchestral score, gorgeous yet forbidding natural vistas and enough shocking tragedies, brazen escapes and crowd-pleasing acts of defiance to fuel several action-adventure pictures. (Seitz) 'THE LAST MIMZY' (PG, 94 minutes) This overstuffed yet warmhearted sci-fi drama follows a pair of wide-eyed siblings as they solve the riddle of a box from the future. Despite leaden direction (by the New Line Cinema honcho Robert Shaye) and a story crammed with pseudoscientific flotsam -- including palm reading, levitation and telepathy -- this wholesome entertainment doesn't talk down. Nevertheless, a film gazing this far into the future shouldn't be quite so unwilling to look beyond the frame. (Catsoulis) * 'OFFSIDE' (PG, 93 minutes, in Persian) The Iranian director Jafar Panahi follows a group of young woman into a Tehran soccer stadium, where they have come to see their nation's team compete for a spot in the World Cup. Instead they are arrested -- women are forbidden to attend sporting events in Iran -- and their predicament yields comedy as well as a trenchant critique of gender politics in the Islamic Republic. (Scott) 'THE PAGE TURNER' (No rating, 85 minutes, in French) A pretty young thing slithers into the bosom of a bourgeois family like an asp in this shivery little thriller from the French filmmaker Denis Dercourt. Not Chabrol, but not bad, either. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE' (PG, 104 minutes) The Zimbabwean-born filmmaker Sunu Gonera's directorial debut, ''Pride,'' about a swim coach (Terrence Howard, star of ''Hustle & Flow'') leading an urban recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of ''I'll Take You There,'' the heart still swells. (Seitz) 'THE PRISONER OR: HOW I PLANNED TO KILL TONY BLAIR' (PG-13, 72 minutes) In 2003 an Iraqi journalist, Yunis Khatayer Abbas, was roused from his Baghdad bed by American soldiers and eventually hauled off to Abu Ghraib. Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein tell his story through newsy video images, talking-head interviews, comic-book-style illustrations and a sympathetic lens. (Dargis) 'REIGN OVER ME' (R, 124 minutes) Mike Binder's comic drama of post-9/11 grief is wildly uneven -- by turns insightful and grindingly mawkish. Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler are two college buddies who reunite, somewhat improbably, some years after the attacks that robbed one of them of his family. The actors rise above the material, particularly in the longer, looser scenes that allow their contrasting temperaments -- Mr. Cheadle's tense understatement and Mr. Sandler's shaggy emoting -- to find a workable syncopation. (Scott) 'SHOOTER' (R, 126 minutes) Muscles bulge, and heads explode in this thoroughly reprehensible, satisfyingly violent entertainment about men and guns and things that go boom. Antoine Fuqua directs, and Mark Wahlberg entertains, with and without his shirt. (Dargis) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'TMNT' (PG, 90 minutes) Spawned by sludge and grandiosely named after Renaissance artists, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been rechristened ''TMNT'' and redrawn by an army of computer-generated-imagery specialists. A strange blend of the futuristic and the ancient, this fourth outing finds them hunting 3,000-year-old monsters. But while the turtles may look prettier, they are no smarter; our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof. (Catsoulis) * 'THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY' (No rating, 127 minutes) Stringent, serious history from Ken Loach, in which the Irish uprising and Civil War of the early 1920s test the loyalties and consciences of two brothers, played by Cillian Murphy and Padraic Delany. (Scott) * 'ZODIAC' (R, 158 minutes) David Fincher's magnificently obsessive new film tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the '70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, ''Zodiac'' is part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts. (Dargis) Film Series NEW DIRECTORS/NEW FILMS (Tonight through Thursday) Now in its second and final week, this 36th annual installment of a festival devoted to ''emerging'' filmmakers and sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art continues at MoMA and the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. Highlights this week: ''The Great World of Sound'' (tonight at MoMA, tomorrow and Sunday at Walter Reade), Craig Zobel's satire about the industry that has grown up to feed contestants to reality shows like ''American Idol''; ''Day Night Day Night,'' a new film by the New York filmmaker Julia Loktev (''Moment of Impact'') that follows a nameless girl around Manhattan as she prepares for her mission as a suicide bomber (tonight at Walter Reade, tomorrow at MoMA); ''The Other Half,'' a Chinese film directed by Ying Liang, in which an ambitious young businesswoman's life is complicated by her aggressively antisocial boyfriend (tomorrow at Walter Reade, Sunday at MoMA). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $12. (Dave Kehr) 'SEVERANCE' (Monday) For their ''Bizarro Mondays'' program at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater in the East Village, the editors of the horror fan magazine Fangoria this week have chosen Christopher Smith's 2006 ''Severance,'' a British film that seems to have been conceived as a cross between ''The Office'' and ''Hostel.'' A group of disgruntled employees of an international arms company are invited for a weekend retreat at a lodge in the Balkans, but fall into the sadistic hands of a group of crazed, sadistic veterans of the recent conflicts. Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village, (212) 591-0434, twoboots.com/pioneer; $10. (Kehr) JACQUES TATI RETROSPECTIVE (Tuesday) Two of the more rarely screened films of this brilliant French comic filmmaker. First is the recently rediscovered and restored color version of Tati's first feature, the 1949 ''Jour de Fête,'' in which a provincial postman (Tati) tries to apply American efficiency methods; it's followed by ''Trafic,'' the 1971 film that Tati made partly to recover the huge financial losses of his masterpiece ''Playtime.'' For Tati, it's relatively conventional, but still quite an innovative and entertaining work. French Institute-Alliance Française, Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6100, fiaf .org; $9. (Kehr) 'UGETSU' (Tonight through Sunday) This yearlong program of 35-millimeter prints from the Janus Films collection continues with noontime screenings of Kenji Mizoguchi's eerie 1953 ghost story of a peasant potter whose path through the civil wars of 16th-century Japan leads him to the estate of a mysterious noblewoman, who is not what she seems. After ''Roshomon,'' this was one of the first Japanese films to gain a reputation in the West, and it remains a transcendent masterpiece. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. CHRISTINA AGUILERA, PUSSYCAT DOLLS, DANITY KANE (Thursday) Frau Farbissina of the ''Austin Powers'' movies said it best: ''Send in the Fembots!'' Ms. Aguilera may have the most virtuosic voice of her generation of bubble gum pop stars, but as she showed with her endless, melismatic protraction of James Brown's ''It's a Man's Man's Man's World'' at the Grammys last month, she can sometimes seem like a singing robot gone berserk. Her tour includes a hit burlesque girl group (the Pussycat Dolls) and an imitation hit burlesque girl group (Danity Kane). At 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $57 and $97. (Ben Sisario) HOSSEIN ALIZADEH AND THE Hamavayan Ensemble (Tomorrow) One of the most celebrated Iranian classical musicians, Mr. Alizadeh is a former conductor and soloist with the Iranian National Orchestra of Radio and Television. Here he plays shurangiz and setar, two kinds of lute, and leads the Hamavayan Ensemble in improvisations and his own compositions. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Jon Pareles) * ALLMAN BROTHERS (Tonight, tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights) The best spring ritual on the Upper West Side is the arrival of this archetypal Southern rock band for its annual series of concerts at the Beacon Theater. In addition to the long, long guitar solos by Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, highlights usually include lots of guest stars. At 8, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $54.99 to $94.99. (Sisario) ANTI-SOCIAL MUSIC (Wednesday) The final frontier for weird rock is classical music. Anti-Social Music, a collective of 11 New York musicians who play in various pop and new-music bands -- including some big ones, like the Hold Steady -- is one of a handful of groups that go boldly into this realm, playing works for strings, woodwinds and the like. Skeptics, note: it can get pretty rowdy. With Capital M. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $10. (Sisario) BLACK DICE (Wednesday) Noise, noise, glorious New York noise. Black Dice, from Brooklyn, is a big player in the international avant-rock scene, and has remained vital by staying truly experimental: whether playing spacey, hokey psychedelia or alien-invasion squalls of feedback, the band throws itself deeply into its every unpredictable turn. With Ocrilim and No Age. At 8 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com or toddpnyc.com; $8. (Sisario) * BLOC PARTY, ALBERT HAMMOND JR. (Tonight and tomorrow night) With spiky but melodic guitars and agitated dance beats, Bloc Party revives the nervous punk-funk of bands like Gang of Four. Its latest, ''A Weekend in the City'' (Vice), is a concept album about life in London after the 2005 transit bombings. Albert Hammond Jr., the rhythm guitarist of the Strokes, has a new solo record, ''Yours to Keep'' (Scratchie/New Line), whose sunshine shows that crisp guitar classicism need not exist solely in the dark behind Manhattan's velvet ropes. With Sebastien Grainger. At 8, United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171, bowerypresents.com; sold out. Mr. Hammond also plays on Monday night at 7 at the Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) BLOOD BROTHERS (Monday) Proving once again rock's inexhaustible lesson that loudness equals liberation, the Blood Brothers, from Seattle, are a five-man weapon of frantic noise and surrealist poetry. (''Set fire to the face on fire.'') With Celebration and Chinese Stars. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $17. (Sisario) THE BOOKS (Tonight) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of disembodied vocal samples, a few notes from a banjo and unclassifiable sounds that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening is trying to figure out just why all this chaos works so wonderfully and wittily. At 7, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; free with museum admission. (Sisario) Barbara Carroll (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) * TOUMANI DIABATÉ'S SYMMETRIC ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Mr. Diabaté, the Malian kora master, plays regular gigs back home in Bamako with this 30-odd-piece big band, mixing ancient songs with salsa-infused funk. Last year he made an excellent album with this group, ''Boulevard de l'Indépendance'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch), and he leads it in its New York debut tonight at 10, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Sisario) DIPLO, BONDE DO ROLE (Tonight) Diplo, born Wesley Pentz -- his stage name is taken from diplodocus, a dinosaur -- is the influential and eclectic D.J. who has worked with the Sri Lankan-British rapper M.I.A., and is half of Hollertronix, a mixtape team from Philadelphia. He has been borrowing from Brazilian baile funk for years, and the first release on his new record label, Mad Descent, is by the Brazilian group Bonde do Role. At 10, Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $12. (Sisario) DR. DOG, O'DEATH (Thursday) Dr. Dog, from Philadelphia, takes a jam-band approach to high-energy rhapsodies that recall ''Abbey Road''-era Beatles. The New York band O'Death draws from the bluntness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the menace of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits, jumbling sacred and profane. With Doublehorse. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) DOWN (Tomorrow) This metal supergroup from New Orleans, featuring Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Pepper Keenan of Corrosion of Conformity, is on a brief tour in advance of a new album with songs about Hurricane Katrina and the killing of Mr. Anselmo's former guitarist in Pantera, Darrell (Dimebag) Abbott. At 8 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $31. (Sisario) HEAVEN AND HELL (Tonight) Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio in place of Ozzy Osbourne. Again. Which means it's effectively 1980 and not very exciting. Again. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $54 to $74. (Sisario) HELLA, DIRTY PROJECTORS (Tonight and tomorrow night) It's impossible to find the center of a Hella song, which explodes in multidirectional streaks of percussion and squawky guitar like a Jackson Pollock painting. Long a guitar-drum duo, the group recently expanded to five members. Dirty Projectors, led by Dave Longstreth, builds elaborate ''glitch operas'' with stark pluckings of guitar and strings, and precise, ecstatic harmonies, all arranged slightly out of whack. Tonight at 9, Europa, 98-104 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $12. Tomorrow at 7, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $12. (Sisario) JET (Thursday) Determined to boil rock down to its AC/DC-meets-Guns-N'-Roses essence, this Australian band dismisses anything that distracts from that goal -- including innovation. With the Virgins. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $28 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) CHRIS KNIGHT (Thursday) Cold-eyed drifters, crooked yet sentimental cops, and prostitutes who kill their johns are characters in the brutal, deadpan songs of Chris Knight, a country singer from Kentucky whose oeuvre resembles Bruce Springsteen's album ''Nebraska'' set in the South. At 8 p.m., Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) LAND OF TALK (Tuesday through Thursday) Riding a wave of blog buzz, this young Montreal band, recalling Dinosaur Jr. and P J Harvey with tangles of grungy guitar and opaque but affecting lyrics, makes a sweep through the clubs. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $10. Wednesday at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $8. Thursday at 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario) * LCD SOUNDSYSTEM (Tonight and tomorrow night) Tim Murphy's perfect, punk-edged disco in LCD Soundsystem -- sharp and sexy but unapologetically silly, retro but smartly innovative -- has roots across the dance-rock map but is unmistakably a product of New York. (''Those of you who still think we're from England/We're not,'' he sings with nasal congestion and typical wryness on ''North American Scum.'') The group celebrates a brilliant new album, ''Sound of Silver'' (Capitol), with two shows at the Bowery Ballroom. At 9, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) Marilyn Maye (Tomorrow and Sunday) This too-seldom-seen jazz belter, now in her mid-'70s, folds Anita O'Day-style swing and chesty Margaret Whiting-like belting into a musical jelly roll with a bittersweet Judy Garland filling. Tomorrow at 7 and 10:30 p.m., Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m., Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden) PAGE McCONNELL (Wednesday) This former keyboardist of Phish offers a preview of his first solo album, to be released next month. At 8 p.m., Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) 'THE MUSIC OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN' (Thursday) Like the Bob Dylan tribute at Lincoln Center a few months ago, this concert, a benefit for the Music for Youth Foundation, gathers a starry group: Steve Earle, Jewel, M. Ward, Josh Ritter, Joseph Arthur, Badly Drawn Boy, Juliana Hatfield, the Holmes Brothers, Elysian Fields, Uri Caine, Odetta and Ronnie Spector, among others. Mr. Dylan didn't show up at his tribute. Will Bruce Springsteen? At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $150. (Sisario) LES NUBIANS (Sunday) The French tried but failed to smooth out African music completely. Les Nubians, two sisters from Cameroon, harmonize in cosmopolitan rhythm-and-blues that Erykah Badu fans would appreciate; they move among smooth soul crooning à la Sade, rapping in French and hints of both American funk and Cameroonian traditions. At 8 and 10 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $26 in advance, $28 at the door (sold out at 8). (Pareles) PERE UBU (Tuesday) In the mid-'70s, while bands like the Dead Boys and the Ramones were perfecting the narrow sonic attack that came to be known as punk, Pere Ubu, from Cleveland, was playing a dissonant, urgent and deeply idiosyncratic variation centered on the sung-spoken vocals of David Thomas. With Golden Error and Beat the Devil. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) SIN-É (Tonight through Sunday) It's never easy to see a good New York rock club go down, but it's especially painful when it happens to the same place twice. In the late 1980s and early '90s, Sin-é, on St. Marks Place in the East Village, was a cozy coffeehouse frequented by singer-songwriters like Jeff Buckley; its new home on the Lower East Side will be shutting down after Sunday night. Tonight is the singer-songwriter Citizen Cope, whose bluesy drawl is delivered over leisurely hip-hop rhythms. Tomorrow night is a standard Sin-é lineup, with four indie-rock bands presented by their record label, Eyeball: Kiss Kiss, New London Fire, the Velocet and the Anthem Sound. Sunday is the country-rocker Bow Thayer. Tonight at 8 and 11, tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday night at 10, 150 Attorney Street, at Stanton Street, (212) 388-0077, sin-e.com; $20 tonight (sold out at 11), $10 tomorrow, $12 on Sunday. (Sisario) * SONS AND DAUGHTERS (Wednesday) With bleak scrapings of guitar, smoldering rhythms and lyrics of unforgiving fate delivered by the petite but wicked Adele Bethel, this Glasgow band has perfected its own kind of chilling murder ballad. With 1990s, and Nicole Atkins and the Sea. At 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) DOC WATSON (Tonight) One of the great repositories of American folk music, the guitarist and singer Doc Watson, from Deep Gap, N.C., plays bluegrass, country and blues in an elegant but understated style. On this tour he is joined by the storyteller David Holt. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $37.

(Nate Chinen) DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Thursday) As the name implies, this big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a sound equally suggestive of Steve Reich minimalism, harmonically advanced indie rock and orchestral jazz in the Bob Brookmeyer descent. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12; $10 for members.

(Chinen) SAL MOSCA (Monday) Mr. Mosca has largely based his piano style -- and, to a considerable extent, his career -- on the heady legacy of the pianist-composer Lennie Tristano.

Her partners here are the engagingly prickly guitarist Nels Cline and the polymorphically propulsive drummer Jim Black. At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen) GEORGE SCHULLER'S CIRCLE WIDE (Sunday) George Schuller, a drummer, leads a group inspired by the acoustic fusion of Miles Davis, about 1968; the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin and the guitarist Brad Shepik apply the necessary push and pull.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'DIE AGYPTISCHE HELENA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) With its convoluted libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and unevenly inspired score by Richard Strauss, this wry contemporary take on the Helen of Troy myth has remained a rarity since its 1928 premiere. But the Metropolitan Opera's fancifully surreal new production by David Fielding, mounted for the soprano Deborah Voigt, makes a compelling case for this intriguing work, thanks to Ms. Voigt's vocally lustrous and affecting portrayal of the title role, as well as the vibrant and insightful conducting of Fabio Luisi. The brilliant coloratura Diana Damrau is wonderful as the sorceress Aithra. The German tenor Torsten Kerl, who had to be replaced halfway through the performance on opening night, because of illness, is scheduled to sing Menelas for the remaining performances. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $120 to $220 tomorrow; $80 to $175 for Wednesday. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'ANDREA CHÉNIER' (Monday) The great Ben Heppner, arguably the leading Wagnerian tenor of our day, continues his bold explorations of far-flung repertory with the title role of Giordano's verismo opera, in the Met's revival of Nicolas Joël's 1996 production. Mr. Heppner may lack the vocal colorings and idiomatic expressivity of the heroic Italian tenors who excelled in this touchstone role. But in his compelling portrayal he sings with burnished sound, vigor and lyrical sensitivity. The rich-voiced soprano Violeta Urmana as Maddalena and the powerful baritone Mark Delavan as Gérard are very strong. Marco Armiliato conducts. Monday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Tommasini) 'La DONNA DEL LAGO' (Tonight, Sunday and Thursday) The New York City Opera continues its fruitful excavations of the bel canto repertory, this time with Rossini's wholly Italian take on Walter Scott's very Scottish original. Alexandrina Pendatchanska sings the part of Elena. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Bernard Holland) * 'FLAVIO' (Wednesday) The New York City Opera revives its successful production, directed by Chas Rader-Shieber, with sets by David Zinn.

At 7:30 p.m., New York City Opera, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Vivien Schweitzer) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) The City Opera offers Mark Lamos's spartan yet attractive production competently sung by Angela Maria Blasi and Raúl Melo. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Holland) METROPOLITAN OPERA NATIONAL COUNCIL GRAND FINALS/40TH ANNIVERSARY (Sunday and Tuesday) The Met goes from bottom to top this week: from 11 young unknowns, who have made their way through three rounds and past hundreds of other applicants in the National Council Auditions, to two of the opera world's biggest stars. Those singers, Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón, will be showcased in three acts from three operas: ''La Bohème,'' ''Manon'' and ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' in honor of the 40th anniversary of the Met's move to Lincoln Center. Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday at 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $150 on Sunday, $250 to $1,250 on Tuesday. (Anne Midgette) * 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' (Tomorrow) Lillian Groag avoids the topical updating that has become a Gilbert and Sullivan tradition and focuses on the work's own satirical targets, which range from Victorian British society to the conventions of Italian grand opera. Even so, her direction for this City Opera production is inventive and lively, as are the performances by a cast that includes Sarah Jane McMahon as Mabel, Matt Morgan as Frederic and Marc Kudisch as the Pirate King. Gerald Steichen conducts. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Allan Kozinn) 'TURANDOT' (Tonight and Thursday night) Andrea Gruber's singing is a matter of debate -- listeners tend to love her intense energy or hate her vocal unevenness -- but Puccini's ice princess Turandot is one of two roles that she indisputably owns these days (the other is Abigaille in ''Nabucco''). Her Calaf is Richard Margison, an equally controversial though less prominent Canadian tenor who has a very respectable voice; for many the draw will be Hei-Kyung Hong, generally a radiant Liu. Since the withdrawal of Richard Armstrong, Fabio Luisi is conducting tonight and Thursday's performances; after that it's Marco Armiliato. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $140 tonight, $15 to $110 for Thursday. (Midgette) Classical Music ACADEMY OF ST.

(Schweitzer) PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Sunday) The excellent adventures of this fine French pianist continue with a mini-history of the piano, beginning with Scarlatti and Bach and extending to Messiaen, Carter, Boulez, Stockhausen and Kurtag. There will be talk as well. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48.

They will be accompanied by Les Arts Florissants. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $56. (Schweitzer) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) A chamber orchestra crowds onto the intimate stage at Bargemusic this weekend to play a program that includes Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons,'' as well as two more of that prolific composer's works, the Concerto in B minor for Four Violins (RV 580) and the Concerto for Two Cellos (RV 531). Nestled amid all this Vivaldi is the premiere of a new work by Igor Raykhelson, commissioned by Bargemusic.

At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34 to $108. (Holland) BARBARA FRITTOLI (Sunday) Italian opera singers sometimes have an uneasy relationship with the recital stage. Barbara Frittoli, a frequent guest at the Metropolitan Opera (most recently in ''Così Fan Tutte''), will set out to disprove this notion in her New York recital debut, which draws heavily on opera composers, while adding a set of Schubert and melodies by Duparc. James Vaughan is the accompanist. At 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $48. (Midgette) * WOLFGANG HOLZMAIR and HERMINE HASELBÖCK (Tonight, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday) On the model of a ''Schubertiade'' -- a festival of Schubert's songs -- comes a ''Wolfiade,'' devoted to the songs of Hugo Wolf, with the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair. Tonight the second of this mini-festival's three free recitals at Weill Recital Hall features Wolf's ''Italienisches Liederbuch,'' with Mr. Holzmair and the mezzo-soprano Hermine Haselböck; the last, on Thursday, adds the soprano Susanna Phillips for a rarity, the complete ''Spanisches Liederbuch.''

There will be pieces by Joan Tower, Steven Stucky, Marco Stroppa and others. At 8 p.m., Casa Italiana, Columbia University, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, between 116th and 118th Streets, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-1623; free, but reservations are recommended. (Tommasini) * MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight) During the concert season a select roster of artists from the prestigious summer Marlboro Music Festival tour America, including annual visits to New York. The next Musicians from Marlboro concert looks particularly enticing. The composer John Harbison's ''Twilight Music'' for horn, violin and piano is a worthy companion piece to Brahms's Trio in E flat (Op. 40), scored for the same unusual group of instruments. Those works frame this program, which also includes Ravel's String Quartet and Stravinsky's Concertino for String Quartet. At 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Tommasini) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) The fine Romanian pianist Radu Lupu joins Colin Davis in Mozart's supremely elegant final concerto, No. 27 in B flat.

At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96.

At 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $56. (Holland) VASSILY PRIMAKOV (Sunday) Arium is a commodious cafe in the meatpacking district that is quickly becoming a popular site for classical music concerts. Its Sunday afternoon series continues with a recital by the young Russian pianist Vassily Primakov, who will play works by Schumann, Beethoven and Brahms. Complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres are served. At 4 p.m., Arium for the Arts, 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; $40; $20 for members.

He is giving a master class tonight, and tomorrow he will play a recital that includes his own transcriptions of Bach's A minor Partita (BWV 1013, originally for flute) and Granados's ''Valses Poéticos,'' as well as works by Weiss, Barrios, Mertz, José Brocá and Hans Haug.

LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and tomorrow night) Classical musicians are lucky: 30 is the cut-off age for ''young'' in the outside world, but if you're a conductor you get to be ''young'' till you're 60 or so. At 48, David Robertson is certainly one of the most-watched ''young'' conductors around: one of his strengths is interesting programming, as his concerts with his St. Louis Symphony show. The first juxtaposes George Benjamin's ''Sudden Time'' (a New York premiere); Bartok's first piano concerto, with the redoubtable Pierre-Laurent Aimard; and Sibelius's Second Symphony. The second brings in the mezzo Susan Graham (substituting for the recovering Dawn Upshaw) for Ravel's ''Shéhérazade,'' between the Adagio from Mahler's 10th and, perhaps the greatest treat of all, John Adams's ''Harmonielehre.'' At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $85. (Midgette) TALICH QUARTET (Sunday) None of the original members of this Czech quartet, founded in 1964, are still in the group. But the current four, Jan Talich and Petr Macecek, violinists; Vladimir Bukac, a violist; and Petr Prause, a cellist, continue the tradition of playing Czech repertory, as well as chamber works. They will perform Haydn's Quartet (Op. 64, No. 5); Mendelssohn's Quartet in A minor; and Janacek's Quartet No. 2 (''Intimate Letters''). At 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 547-0715, frick.org; $25. (Schweitzer) * TALLIS SCHOLARS (Tomorrow) Peter Phillips and his a cappella group have given some superb concerts of English Renaissance works recently, and they now turn their attention to Monteverdi, Palestrina, Gombert, Lassus and Browne. Among the centerpieces is Monteverdi's Mass for Four Voices, a work worth discovering if you don't know it (or revisiting if you do). At 8 p.m., Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 120th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2 p.m., All Stars Project Theater, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 941-1234, allstars.org; $30 and $35; T.D.F. vouchers accepted. (Dunning) AMY DAWN VEREBAY (Tonight and tomorrow night) A member of the wacky Circus Amok, Ms. Verebay will present a dance-theater production called ''Once in Love With Amy'' that chronicles her attempts to turn ''her life's lead into gold,'' as she puts it. At 8, WOW Café Theater, 59-61 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 545-5334; $12. (Dunning) ELLIS WOOD DANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Wood and her all-female company will perform her new ''Flat Affect,'' which aims to expose the cause and effect of women's irrational fears. (Could they all be irrational? Tsk, tsk.) (Through April 7.) At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org; $20. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * brooklyn museum: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is essentialist and body-oriented and doesn't venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art the exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Grace Glueck) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) * The METropolitan museum of art: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * The Met: 'Mother of Pearl: A Tradition in Asian Lacquer,' through April 1. Ornamentalism is the term for this show of some 40 objects so exquisite that they might have been conceived with a modern museum conservator's soft white cotton gloves in mind. The technique for creating mini-mosaics from slivers of mollusk shell is an ancient one that was perfected in China before traveling to Korea, Japan, Thailand and India. Examples from all those places are here in writing boxes and tea trays guaranteed to appeal to any window-shopper's acquisitive yearnings and magpie eye. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Moma: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This show makes a case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith) * Neue Galerie: 'Van Gogh and Expressionism,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious hommage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Schwendener) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea JEAN SHIN: KEY PROMISES The idea is obvious, if you're as keen as this artist on recycling everyday objects: an installation using the word commands of countless computer keyboards to orchestrate a flow of suggested actions, desires and emotional states across four walls of a small gallery. From esc and shift to return and home. Art lite, perhaps, but expertly done. Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992, frederieketaylorgallery.com, through April 7. (Smith) Galleries: Other 'Gifts of the Forest: Native Traditions in Wood and Bark' Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that for the most part carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, through April 27. (Glueck) Last Chance * DISSOCIATE: NEW HUMANS Dominated by poster-paintings on handy rolling bases, the occasional space-confounding mirror and sundry fliers, this mutable installation by the talented sculptor and sound artist Mika Tajima has served both as a performance space and as an advertising campaign for her noise band, New Humans. The textilelike patterns; limited, decoratorish palette; and diverse printing methods are a bit familiar to art in this age of self-conscious mechanical reproduction (Wade Guyton, for example). But it is worth seeing. Collaborators include the musician Howie Chen and the artists Vito Acconci, José Léon Cerillo and Philippe Decrauzat. Elizabeth Dee, 545 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-7545, elizabethdeegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * Sam Gordon: Three Ways: painting, Drawing, video There's a lot going on in this virtuosic solo show. Mr. Gordon's beautiful, cryptic drawings and paintings cover the gallery walls, while two sections of his epic video ''The Lost Kinetic World: Volumes 1-4,'' play on a monitor. The videos are a two-and-a-half-hour documentary compilation of art world events and personalities, good, bad and ugly, with past and present, prosaic and extraordinary, spliced together, willy-nilly. For whatever reason, Mr. Gordon watches the art world closely. Now it's time for the art world to wake up to him, a treasure in its midst. Feature Inc., 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7772; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Grey Art Gallery: 'Semina Culture: Wallace Berman & His Circle' The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) was a central, charismatic figure in an underground of West Coast artists and poets in the 1950s and 60s. A collagist, poet, photographer and the publisher of an influential journal, Semina, he inspired others to make art too, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write. And a traveling love company of them has come to Grey Art Gallery, trailing dreams, delusions and marijuana clouds. New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * PHILIP TAAFFE This artist's first New York show since 2000 anoints him as one of the best painters of his generation, and maybe the only one to extend both 1970s Pattern and Decoration and '80s appropriation into new areas. Aided by Warhol's tinted colors and Pollock's all-over rhythms, and some ingenious printing techniques of their own, these suavely eye-popping new paintings sample everything from Northwest Coast Indian masks to Islamic ornamental patterns to marbleizing and gilding. They define visual culture as a great chain of being in which anything can be connected with proper placement, color and scale in an inspiring message of unity in difference. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * PAUL STRAND AT WORK More than three dozen vintage improbably rich, impeccably printed vintage photographs, taken by Strand between 1943 and 1953, make their measured, concentrated way through a range of rural subjects in New England, France and Italy and dot the gallery walls like faceted gems. Pace/MacGill Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'United Black Girls,' This group show is a response by six artists to the way the black female body appears in popular culture. Ifetayo A. Abdus-Salam takes charge by channeling Pam Grier; Jessica Peavy links early feminism and music videos; Heather Hart takes aim with crocheted guns. Omya Alston, Ashley Reid and Felicia Megginson combine images of exploitation and empowerment in various ways, with a healthy dose of attitude. Courtney J. Martin and Vanessa C. B. Riding put it all together. Rush Arts Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-9552; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

VGeraldine Blue Bird, who became a symbol of the extreme poverty that plagued the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation when President Bill Clinton visited it in July 1999, was sentenced in Rapid City on Wednesday to 34 years in federal prison. Ms. Blue Bird was convicted last fall of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, possession of a firearm in relation to drug trafficking and conspiracy to distribute marijuana. She was \u201cpretty much the ringleader\u201d of a conspiracy based out of her home that trafficked an estimated $2 million worth of cocaine from Denver to Nebraska and South Dakota over three years, beginning in 2002, the local United States attorney, Marty Jackley, said. Twenty-eight people, including family members, have been indicted in the investigation.

VArtist's Garbage Fetches Millions Francis Bacon's trash has sold for $2.26 million at auction. The 45 lots consisted of paintings and other items that the incensed Irish-born British artist (1909-92) sought to discard in 1978 after they were disturbed by workmen at his chaotic studio in London, the BBC reported. Mac Robertson, an electrical contractor who had become a Bacon friend and drinking companion, rescued them and stored them in an attic. The lots on sale at the Ewbank auction rooms in Woking, England, had been valued at $100,000. But a painting of a dog that was expected to sell for $6,000 sold for $610,000, and four portraits mutilated by Bacon, who would cut out parts he didn't like, sold for a total of $240,000. No Jail for Willie Nelson Willie Nelson, below, and his tour manager, David Anderson, were spared jail sentences when they pleaded guilty on Tuesday in St. Martinville, La., to a misdemeanor count of marijuana possession, The Associated Press reported. State District Judge Paul deMahy fined the men $1,024 each and put them on probation for six months. Mr. Nelson; Mr. Anderson; Mr. Nelson's sister, Bobbie Nelson; and two drivers were issued citations on Sept. 18 after state troopers said they found marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms on their tour bus during a commercial-vehicle inspection on Interstate 10. As part of the plea deal, the citation against Ms. Nelson was dismissed. The citations against the drivers were also dismissed. St. Martin Parish Assistant District Attorney Chester Cedars said there was no indication they ''had anything to do with the contraband.'' Public Library Acquires Gay and Lesbian Archive A major archive of letters, photographs, handbills, manuscripts, publications and other materials gathered by two pioneers in the campaign for gay and lesbian rights has been acquired by the New York Public Library. The materials were donated by Barbara Gittings, an activist, editor and writer who died in February, and by her partner, the photojournalist and author Kay Tobin Lahusen. The Barbara Gittings and Kay Tobin Lahusen Gay History Papers and Photographs will be housed at the Humanities and Social Sciences Library's manuscripts and archives division on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Footnotes HBO has given the go-ahead to ''The Pacific,'' a 10-hour World War II mini-series with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg as the executive producers, Reuters reported. A companion piece to their Emmy-winning 2001 HBO mini-series, ''Band of Brothers,'' the new venture will follow three marines -- Robert Leckie, John Basilone and Eugene Sledge -- from the Battle of Guadalcanal to their triumphant return home after V-J Day. A memoir by Scott McClellan, who departed as President Bush's chief spokesman in 2006, is to be published next spring by PublicAffairs, The Associated Press reported. The mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato has been named the recipient of the second annual Beverly Sills Artist Award for young singers at the Metropolitan Opera. The $50,000 prize, described by the Met as the largest of its kind in the United States, goes to singers between 25 and 40 year old who have appeared in featured solo roles with the company. Ms. DiDonato is starring in the Met's new production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia.''

VA terminally ill woman who sued the United States government over the right to use medical marijuana, as state law allows, said she was dropping her five-year legal battle. The woman, Angel M. Raich, 41, of Oakland, said in a statement that she had decided to concentrate on radiation therapy to treat a brain tumor, rather than appealing a federal court ruling that she was not immune to federal prosecution despite California law. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a quitter, so this was a hard decision,&#8221; said Ms. Raich, who has never been prosecuted. She said she intended to take her battle to Congress.

VSelective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition. Theater Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater. Previews and Openings 'CRAZY MARY' Previews start today. Opens on June 3. In A. R. Gurney's new play, Sigourney Weaver stars as a woman who discovers that her cousin, the title character, who is a patient in a psychiatric hospital, holds the keys to the family fortune (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'GASLIGHT' In previews; opens on Thursday. The always fascinating Brian Murray stars in Patrick Hamilton's thriller about a man who drives his wife insane (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. 'IN A DARK DARK HOUSE' Previews start on Wednesday. Opens on June 7. Neil LaBute's latest drama features Frederick Weller and Ron Livingston as hostile siblings sorting out a history of abuse. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. 'PASSING STRANGE' In previews; opens on Monday. The Joe's Pub veteran and pop singer Stew tries his hand at musical theater, with a rock-theme score and a story about the journey of a black bohemian (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. 'PHALLACY' Previews start on Sunday. Opens on May 18. An art historian and a chemistry professor argue over the authenticity and value of a statue in this new drama by the scientist and playwright Carl Djerassi (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. 'TEN MILLION MILES' Previews start today. Opens on June 14. A new musical by the singer Patty Griffin and the playwright Keith Bunin (''The Busy World is Hushed'') is about a road trip from Florida to New York. Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CORAM BOY' Set in 18th-century England, this melodrama about imperiled orphans is big and broad but not particularly deep. With a cast of 40, an orchestra in the pit and bursts of choral music (Handel, mostly) decorating the proceedings, it is tastefully splashy and certainly impressive, but less emotionally engaging than you might hope (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'AMERICAN FIESTA' The economist, consultant, preacher and playwright Steven Tomlinson makes his New York stage debut with a one-man show about how it was that he came to collect Fiestaware, the colorful china of the Depression years, which he deploys as a metaphor for just about everything. An astute observer of consumer obsession, Mr. Tomlinson ultimately subordinates much of his clever writing to a tepid and trite political message: that American civic life is a fractured bowl that needs to be put back together. American Fiesta is also about gay marriage, eBay and neuroscience, which is to say that it is about much too much (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Ginia Bellafante) 'BAD BLOOD (MALASANGRE)' A wife is offered a lucrative job in Texas; her husband moves with her from Puerto Rico but rails against the condition of being a Latino in the United States. Presented in Spanish and English on different nights, this play by Roberto Ramos Perea is full of ideas and anger, but the political fury of the husband is not, in the English version, completely borne out by his characterization, and you can see the charting of the play a little too clearly between the lines. (2:30). Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 354-1293. (Anne Midgette) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BEAUTY ON THE VINE' Zak Berkman presents muddled politics and distorted anxieties in his quasi science-fiction play about the influence of plastic surgery on young women who start modeling themselves after a right-wing radio host. Adding to the atmosphere of hysteria is the inability of the actors to render a single subtle or nuanced moment (2:10). Harold Clurman Theater, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) 'BIOGRAPHY' A revival of S. N. Behrman's hoary 1932 comedy about a society portraitist and the men who keep trying to reign her in feels slight as a needlepoint pillow. As the play's supposedly beguiling heroine, Marion Froude, Carolyn McCormick never beguiles (2:15). The Pearl Theater, 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, www.livingtheatre.org. (Isherwood) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE RECeiPT' A lost bar receipt provides a one-way ticket to bedlam in a clever and diverting show that mirrors the idiosyncrasies of modern life as two young archaeologists study a ''lost'' city and postulate on a day in the life of one of its inhabitants (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'WEST MOON STREET' Rob Urbinati's adaptation of Oscar Wilde's short story ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' delightfully mines a comedy of manners, a meditation on premarital fear, out of a clever mystery on fate. The performances, one and all, are first-rate (2:00). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) Off Off Broadway 'OCTOPUS LOVE STORY' Gay marriage is a theme of this sitcomlike drama about a political protest turned unlikely romance (1:30). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'ON THE VERGE' An amusing revival of Eric Overmyer's play about three Victoria-era ladies who set out, armed with parasols and machetes, to explore a terra incognita. As they ''whack the bushes'' into virgin territory, they soon discover they are traveling into the future (2:00). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 777-4280). (Hampton) 'REALISM' and 'JUMP!' The stately Jean Cocteau Repertory (now known as the Exchange) gets a hipster makeover with two foul-mouthed and aggressive new provocations from Britain (1:30 each). Kirk Theater, 420 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) 'THE SEA' This odd 1973 play by Edward Bond gets a vivid production by the Actors Company Theater, but be forewarned: this ain't American humor. It's the sly, incongruous British variety. A fatal shipwreck off the coast of an eclectic little village turns the inhabitants even weirder than they already are. One fellow is convinced that space aliens are behind the wreck (2:20). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25).

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Honor Moore) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'DENIAL' An engrossing and timely legal drama about a Holocaust denier being defended by a Jewish lawyer, this play examines the moral and ethical dilemma inherent in the First Amendment and asks how much sufferance can a free society give its crackpots and maintain its individual liberties (2:30). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302; closes on Sunday. (Hampton) 'EXPOSED: EXPERIMENTS IN LOVE, SEX, DEATH AND ART' Annie Sprinkle and Elizabeth Stephens, partners in life and art, share memories of their colorful history together. Donning lab coats, they also engage the audience in some informal experiments intended to increase the store of love in the world. Sloppy but somewhat sweet (1:30). Collective: Unconscious, 279 Church Street, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting the now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must see! (Manohla Dargis) THE CONDEMNED' (R, 100 minutes) This simple-minded vehicle for the wrestling star Steve Austin follows a bunch of muscle-bound lowlifes as they fight to the death for the benefit of an Internet reality show. Leaden and inept, the movie fails to deliver even the action goods, presenting every fight scene in such quaking, extreme close-up that it's difficult to tell who's pummeling whom. Fortunately, the language of pain is universal. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden) * 'DIGGERS' (R, 90 minutes) This minutely observed period piece, set in 1976, about clam diggers on the south shore of Long Island, has the brave, mournful tone of a Springsteen song (''My Hometown,'' say) set in Billy Joel territory. ( Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) * 'ELECTION' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Cantonese) This intricate gangster entertainment, the first episode in a two-part sequence from the prolific Hong Kong action maestro Johnnie To, offers some acute lessons in the pitfalls of democracy. Also a feast of fighting, humor and fine acting, in particular from Simon Yaw, who plays a soft-spoken, businesslike candidate for chairman of Hong Kong's oldest criminal organization. (Scott) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'IN THE LAND OF WOMEN' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This meek, mopey comedy is the film equivalent of a sensitive emo band with one foot in alternative rock and the other in the squishy pop mainstream. The movie would like to think of itself as a softer, fuzzier ''Garden State.'' (Holden) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) 'LUCKY YOU' (PG-13, 124 minutes) Eric Bana plays a poker player with daddy issues (Robert Duvall is his dad), and Drew Barrymore is an aspiring singer who catches his eye in this tepid Las Vegas romance. It's not terrible, just content to break even. (Scott) 'MEET THE ROBINSONS' (G, 93 minutes) Actually, if you see them coming, run in the other direction. (Scott) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' (No rating, 120 minutes, in French) A film from the venerable French auteur Alain Resnais about love and cinematic spaces, elegant camera moves and six heavenly bodies as seen through a mighty telescope. (Dargis) * 'RED ROAD' (No rating, 113 minutes) Andrea Arnold's first feature falls into melodrama and implausibility at the end, but along the way it is a remarkably assured and complex piece of work, anchored by the director's formal control and by Jackie Dick's quietly heartbreaking performance as a Glasgow video-surveillance officer with an unhappy past. (Scott) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This Bollywood movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Rachel Saltz) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'THE TREATMENT' (No rating, 86 minutes) Oren Rydavsky's adaptation of the Daniel Menaker novel about love and psychoanalysis in New York has its heart and head in the right place, but not much else, including its sympathetic stars, Chris Eigeman, Famke Janssen and Ian Holm. (Dargis) * 'TRIAD ELECTION' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Cantonese) The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller ''Triad Election'' as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier, more liable to stain. A brutal look at the shadows darkening the Hong Kong triads, the film picks up the narrative line first coiled and kinked in Mr. To's companion thriller, ''Election.'' (Dargis) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals GENERATION GARREL (Today through Thursday) In France, Philippe Garrel occupies a position in the avant-garde somewhere between John Cassavetes (for his love of garrulous actors and messy dramatic situations) and Andy Warhol (for his love-hate relationship with glamour and stardom). This series widens the focus to include two other members of the Garrel family: his father, Maurice, and his son Louis, both actors. The 23-year-old Louis opens the program tonight with a sneak preview of ''Dans Paris,'' the new film by the promising young director Christophe Honoré (whose 2004 ''Ma Mere,'' also with Louis, plays on Sunday). Tomorrow's schedule includes Philippe's 2005 ''Regular Lovers,'' a film about the depressing aftermath of the social unrest of 1968. On Wednesday the 84-year-old Maurice takes center stage for Philippe's 1983 ''Liberté, la nuit,'' in which he stars as an aging activist caught up in the protests surrounding the Algerian war. And on Thursday the whole family (including Louis's mother, the actress Brigitte Sy) turns up in ''Emergency Kisses'' (1988), an autobiographical film about a director (Philippe) making an autobiographical film. BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) 10 LATIN AMERICAN & SPANISH FILMS FROM THE LAST 100 YEARS (Tonight through Thursday) As part of the High Line Festival, the Quad Cinema will screen movies by Spanish and Latin American filmmakers. The series opens at 7:30 tonight with ''El Automovil Gris'' (1919), a Mexican crime film by Enrique Rosas Priego and presented here by the Mexican theater company El Teatro de Ciertos Habitantes. The 10 o'clock show is Alberto Gout's entertaining 1949 ''Aventurera,'' a lurid ''cabaretera'' melodrama about a girl from the sticks (Ninón Sevilla) kidnapped by human traffickers. Other highlights include, tomorrow, Tomas Gutierrez Alea's ''Memorias del Subdesarrollo'' (1968), one of the finest products of Cuban cinema, and, on Tuesday, Luis Bunuel's 1954 English-language, made-in-Mexico ''Robinson Crusoe'' and Victor Erice's dark and lyrical 1973 Spanish film about the terrors of childhood, ''El Espíritu de la Colmena.'' Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-8800, highlinefestival.com; $12; $35 for ''El Automovil Gris.'' (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. THE ALBUM LEAF, YOUNG GALAXY (Tomorrow and Sunday) Jimmy LaValle, one of the guitarists in the San Diego band Tristeza, creates peaceful, glittering galaxies of electronics and soft guitar in his mostly instrumental side project, the Album Leaf. For a group called a duo, Montreal's Young Galaxy had an awful lot of people onstage at its last New York appearance -- the better to help make that languorous wash of guitars and sleepy vocals. With Belong. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15. Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Ben Sisario) LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES (Tomorrow) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades -- James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960s boogaloo, '70s Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rap -- while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm. With DJ Afro and Todosantos. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $22. (Jon Pareles) LAURIE ANDERSON (Thursday) Ms. Anderson's entrancing performances weave coolly surrealistic songs and reflective monologues with a witty, seamless dream logic. She unveils a new piece as part of David Bowie's High Line Festival. At 7:30 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com or highlinefestival.com; $37. (Sisario) * ARCTIC MONKEYS (Tuesday) Emerging from Sheffield, England, a couple of years ago as an unstoppable teenage indie-rock machine, Arctic Monkeys played perfect, cutting post-punk riffs and sang of night-life exhaustion with a jadedness beyond their years. Now, with the members barely into their 20s, the band has returned with ''Favourite Worst Nightmare'' (Domino), and thankfully not much has changed: danceable, slashing grooves and sneered lyrics about the morning-after blahs. With Be Your Own Pet. At 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; sold out. (Sisario) ANDREW BIRD (Thursday) A talented multi-instrumentalist, Mr. Bird shows off his fiddle- and guitar-playing in wistful, fantastical folk reveries. But his most impressive technique is not on fiddle or guitar, nor on the electronic effects that he uses to make the music breathe; it's his dexterous, expressive whistling, which floats high above in eerily beautiful tones. With Joan as Policewoman. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) * ELVIS COSTELLO AND THE IMPOSTORS (Wednesday) Jazz and classical pursuits may command more and more of his time these days, but Mr. Costello is still at his best leading his band through a set of taut, squirmy soul-rock. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) DAN DEACON (Tomorrow) This Baltimore partymeister has become an underground celebrity playing the kind of music Max Headroom might have made, with low-tech synthesizers pumping manic, smarmy melodies at high volume and accelerated tempo. Channeled through Mr. Deacon's antic stage persona, it all becomes house-rocking sensory overload. With Ponytail, Meneguar and Lions and Tigers. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sisario) * DEERHOOF (Thursday) With scratchy guitars set against Satomi Matsuzaki's nursery rhyme vocals, and songs that zip through multiple personality changes, Deerhoof, from San Francisco, makes jarringly experimental art-pop that somehow remains inviting and sweet. The band plays as part of the High Line Festival with Dirty Projectors, who build elaborate ''glitch operas'' with stark pluckings of strings and precise, ecstatic harmonies; and Robert Stillman's Horses. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, highlinefestival.com; $16.50. (Sisario) ELECTRELANE (Tuesday) The women of this British quartet have found a middle ground between Stereolab's ethereal drone and the earthy twee-pop of groups like the Pastels. ''No Shouts, No Calls'' (Too Pure), their new album, has a rock 'n' roll pulse even at its most tranquil. With Tender Forever and the Blow. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $15. (Sisario) TIM FINN (Tomorrow) When Mr. Finn sings about ''the warm Pacific sun,'' he's talking about good times not in California but in New Zealand, where he has been a star since his days in the new wave band Split Enz (and, on and off, in Crowded House with his brother Neil). On his latest album, ''Imaginary Kingdom'' (Manhattan), he offers a familiar New World optimism over Beatlesesque melodies, shaking his head at naysayers in history and romance: ''When they say it can't be done, we have to prove them wrong.'' He plays a rare solo show at Joe's Pub. At 7:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) * DANIEL JOHNSTON, BANG ON A CAN ALL-STARS, THE LEGENDARY STARDUST COWBOY (Wednesday) In a feat of inspired programming, David Bowie has put together this bill for his High Line Festival, with some of the brainiest of the New York avant-garde (Bang on a Can All-Stars) meeting two of Texas's most extreme outsider musicians. Daniel Johnston writes stirringly candid songs that sound as if they could be the dreams or nightmares of John Lennon. The Legendary Stardust Cowboy has earned an indelible rock footnote: his wild 1968 song ''Paralyzed'' inspired Mr. Bowie to create his glam-era alter ego Ziggy Stardust. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com or highlinefestival.com; sold out. Mr. Johnston also plays Tuesday at 8 p.m. at Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $18. The Legendary Stardust Cowboy plays Thursday at 9 p.m. at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. (Sisario) ANGÉLIQUE KIDJO (Wednesday) On her new album, ''Djin Djin'' (Razor & Tie), this Beninese singer welcomes a handful of guest stars -- Josh Groban, Joss Stone and Alicia Keys, among others -- into the orbit of her humanist Afro-pop. But the album's best moments come when Ms. Kidjo engages with a strong supporting cast, as she will here. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $32 in advance, $36 at the door. (Nate Chinen) * KIKI AND HERB (Sunday and Thursday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And the inimitable Christmas show. After playing their regular Sunday night Joe's Pub gig this week, Kiki and Herb go to the Knitting Factory on Thursday to record a new DVD. Sunday at 11:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20, Thursday at 8 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $20. (Sisario) LCD SOUNDSYSTEM (Tomorrow and Monday) James Murphy's punk-edged disco in LCD Soundsystem -- sharp and sexy but unapologetically silly, retro but smartly innovative -- has roots across the dance-rock map but is unmistakably a product of New York: ''Those of you who still think we're from England/We're not,'' he sings with adenoidal wryness on the band's brilliant new album, ''Sound of Silver'' (Capitol). With Yacht. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $20. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) * STEPHEN MARLEY (Tonight) It sometimes seems as if there is a paratrooper brigade of young Marleys arriving on the reggae and pop scenes: first there was Ziggy and others in the Melody Makers, then Damian, then Ky-Mani and Julian. But Stephen Marley, 35, who rapped as a teenager on early Melody Makers songs, has the distinction of being a strong songwriter and a Grammy-winning producer. He has just released his debut album, ''Mind Control'' (Universal Republic), which features tales of incarceration over marijuana and lots of guest spots by -- who else? -- other Marleys. This show will feature his younger brother Damian (a k a Junior Gong), for whom he produced the hit ''Welcome to Jamrock.'' At 9, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) * MASTODON, AGAINST ME!, CURSIVE (Thursday) Until Mastodon released ''Leviathan'' three years ago, the world lacked an extreme-metal album based on ''Moby-Dick''; it's appropriately dense and exhilarating and fully attentive to every slashing sonic detail, as is this Atlanta band's latest, ''Blood Mountain.'' Also on this unusual but intriguing bill: Against Me!, punk eccentrics from Gainesville, Fla., who specialize in roaring, galloping folk songs; and Cursive, a band from Omaha with one foot in emo and the other in exuberant chamber-pop. At 6:15 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $25 in advance, $28 at the door. (Sisario) NO FUN FEST (Thursday) Now something of a spring tradition, this four-day festival of noise-rock -- and any other kind of avant-garde music, as long as it's clamorous and loud -- begins on Thursday with Hair Police, from the fertile Michigan scene; Yoshimi of the Boredoms with Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth; Pain Jerk; Hive Mind and Damion Romero; Lambsbread; Evil Moisture; Crumbling; and Orphan Fairytale. Take earplugs. At 7 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Richards Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007, thehookmusic.com or nofunfest.com; $18. (Sisario) JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Wednesday) Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn and depressed, sung over light strums of guitar with the guileless vulnerability of a 2 a.m. phone confession, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' She has a Wednesday residency this month at the Living Room. At 11 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) * JOHN PIZZARELLI AND JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) These married musicians have been called ''the Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim, Dave Frishberg, Paul Simon, and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross join hands. (Through May 26.) At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 Tuesday through Thursday; $85 tonight and tomorrow. (Holden) * DUNCAN SHEIK (Tuesday) Broadway gigs are usually not important creative turning points for pop songwriters. But ''Spring Awakening'' was the best thing to happen to Mr. Sheik's music in years, giving his silken, phlegmatic songs a youthful and erotic kick. For this show at the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he is to play ''Spring Awakening'' material and other songs. At 8 p.m., 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $35. (Sisario) SLOAN (Tonight) Like modern metafictions, Sloan's pop-rock songs twist inward on themselves. With their winsome tunes and neo-Beatles intricacies, they are not just about unrequited yearnings, but also about the process of writing pop songs about unrequited yearnings. They're rarely so clever that their heart doesn't come through. With Small Sins. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $20. (Pareles) SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS (Wednesday) This veteran three-piece from North Carolina knows just how much to poke fun at chicken-fried, backwoods rockabilly: a lot, but not too much to get in the way of some finger-licking twangy guitar. Don't let the band leave without playing its barnstorming ode to Santo, the vigilante Mexican wrestler. With the Dansettes and Jule Brown. At 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) * SPANISH HARLEM ORCHESTRA (Wednesday) Anyone who's heard a salsa band in New York City has probably seen some of the members of this group: they're the virtuosic journeymen who are one of New York's great musical resources.

Mr. Simon is to appear as a guest on Wednesday. At 10 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $20.

Rock/USAdown is a duo of Dave Unger and Joe Johnson, formerly of the Washington noise-rock band Love 666. They've kept the skronk going with their new collaboration, ''This Is the New American National Anthem'' (Feedback), a 47-minute wave of sonic chaos that now and then reflects bits of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''

(Sisario) LAURA VEIRS (Wednesday) Ms. Veirs's ballads, with electronics twinkling above soft acoustic guitars like stars in a perfect night sky, cast romance as both intimate contact and cosmic event. With Charles Bissell and Lake. At 7 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $14 in advance, $16 at the door.

(Through May 19.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tonight) Bartlett Sher's breezy production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' introduced in November, conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which the characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality in this tale of romantic intrigue also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle direction of a handsome cast. The captivating young mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato is a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. The accomplished American tenor Lawrence Brownlee, in his Met debut role, makes a sweet-toned, technically agile and appealing Count Almaviva. The baritone Russell Braun is another standout for his hardy and clever Figaro. Maurizio Benini conducts. Tonight will be the final ''Barbiere'' of the season. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'CASTOR ET POLLUX' (Thursday) Rameau was a wonderful opera composer, but since there is not a big market for the French baroque at major opera houses, this is a relatively rare chance to hear one of his operas in New York. The diminutive Opera Français de New York has helped propel the conductor Yves Abel into a larger career, but he returns to it for these two performances (there is another next weekend), featuring talented young singers like the soprano Erin Morley. At 8 p.m., French Institute/Alliance Française, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160, fiaf.org; $50; $40 for students and members. (Anne Midgette) * 'ORFEO ED EURIDICE' (Tomorrow) In his Met debut, the choreographer Mark Morris has created an often magical and unapologetically fanciful modern-dress production of Gluck's sublime masterpiece ''Orfeo ed Euridice.'' He draws rich portrayals from the elegant and ardent countertenor David Daniels as Orfeo, the earthy soprano Maija Kovalevska as Euridice, and the sweet-toned soprano Heidi Grant Murphy as the god Amor, here a sassy, angelic Ellen DeGeneres look-alike who descends from the skies to intervene in the story. Members of Mr. Morris's company, supplemented by dancers from the Met, are silent participants in the action. But nearly 100 vocally robust choristers portray historical witnesses to the drama, everyone from Henry VIII to Mahatma Gandhi to Princess Di. James Levine conducts a distinguished performance. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini) * 'IL TRITTICO' (Tomorrow) The Met's season ends tomorrow night with its new ''Trittico,'' Puccini's triptych of one-act operas, which is now officially the most elaborate production in the company's repertory. The director Jack O'Brien has created grandly old-fashioned yet insightful and effective stagings of these three very different operas: ''Il Tabarro,'' a grim love triangle aboard a barge in Paris; ''Suor Angelica,'' a tender, mystical and ultimately devastating story of a young nun's yearning to be with her dead child; and ''Gianni Schicchi,'' an irreverent comedy about the avaricious relatives of a miserly old man who has just died. The earthy soprano Maria Guleghina as the beleaguered barge-owner's wife, the impassioned soprano Barbara Frittoli as Sister Angelica, and the stylish baritone Alessandro Corbelli as the shrewd Schicchi are stand-outs, though the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe, who plays three supporting roles, almost steals each show. Joseph Colaneri conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini) * VOX 2007 (Tomorrow and Sunday) ''Showcasing American composers'' is the tag line of City Opera's annual series of readings of contemporary operas-in-progress. Twelve composers, from Robert Aldridge to John Zorn, present excerpts from their works in six afternoon sessions, each preceded by a panel discussion. Tomorrow night four independent groups present new works of their own, including a new ''operina'' by Jack Beeson, as part of the Vox umbrella. Readings begin at noon, performances tomorrow night at 8, Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 992-8484, nycopera.com; free. (Midgette) Classical Music * PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Tonight) Concerts of excerpts, short works and juggled movements can easily misfire, but if anyone can make something of the format, it is Pierre-Laurent Aimard, one of the more thoughtful pianists performing now. He has, in any case, made this montage approach work in several recent recitals, and the material at hand here holds out fascinating possibilities. Among the composers represented are Boulez, Stockhausen, Kurtag, Liadov, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Bartok, Webern, Janacek, Schoenberg, Beethoven and Schubert. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48. (Allan Kozinn) AMERICAN STRING QUARTET (Tonight) A prestigious Naumburg Award gave the American String Quartet its start more than 30 years ago.

At 8, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20. (Tommasini) * ALISON BALSOM (Sunday) The indispensable Free for All at Town Hall series continues with a recital by the trumpeter Alison Balsom. Forging a solo trumpet career is not easy. And almost all the players who have succeeded have been male. But Ms. Balsom, a 27-year-old Brit, is having great success, with two acclaimed EMI Classics recordings already to her credit. She is joined by the Balsom Ensemble for a program of works by Bach, Purcell, Handel, Byrd, Falla and Piazzolla. At 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 707-8787, freeforallattownhall.org; free tickets will be available at the box office at noon. (Tommasini) BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Under the leadership of Michael Christie, its dynamic young music director, this orchestra has offered a number of stimulating concerts recently. It closes the season with another intriguing program, featuring the Ridge Theater staging of Gorecki's Symphony No. 3, and Hindemith's ''Mathis der Maler,'' with Nathalie Paulin, a soprano, as soloist. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, brooklynphilharmonic.org; $20 to $60.

(Midgette) DISCOVERIES (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Austrian Cultural Forum's final mini-festival of the season features nominally less-known songs, including works by Johan Hoven, who set Heine's cycle ''Die Heimkehr'' -- all 88 poems -- to music. The first program, performed by Elisabeth von Magnus, a mezzo, includes a set of Hoven songs, as well as works by Haydn and a group of familiar works by Mozart. At 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; free, but reservations are required.

Here the program includes a Mozart piano trio, a Dvorak piano quartet and the Shostakovich String Quartet No. 8. At 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Holland) * PAUL O'DETTE and ELLEN HARGIS (Tuesday) The soprano Ellen Hargis and the lutenist Paul O'Dette have proved an inventive early-music recital team, and their current program of 17th-century songs and lute solos -- offered as part of the Boston Early Music Festival's New York series -- promises a bit of everything, from love songs and humorous works to heart-rending laments. At 7:30 p.m., Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org; $45; $35 for members.

Mr. Perlman will announce other works from the stage, adding a whiff of spontaneity to the evening. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $70. (Schweitzer) * MAURIZIO POLLINI (Tomorrow) In his two Carnegie Hall recitals, the pianist Maurizio Pollini is exploring the links between standard repertory works and classic modern scores. At the first, late last month, he traced the links between Chopin, Debussy and Pierre Boulez. Now he turns to German composers for a program that includes' Stockhausen's Klavierstücke VII and VIII, Schumann's ''Kreisleriana'' and Beethoven's ''Hammerklavier'' Sonata. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34 to $108. (Kozinn) ST. THOMAS CHOIR (Tuesday) John Scott leads his superb choir of men and boys in Rachmaninoff's Vespers, a remarkably rich work that draws on ancient Russian chant.

We get a good look at Tchaikovsky's enduring influence on Stravinsky. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $98. (Holland) BRIGHT SHENG AND DAEDALUS STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) Bright Sheng is a lively and internationally acclaimed composer, and composer in residence at Flushing Town Hall: He has organized several concerts at its small theater, and this weekend is the host of a performance with two of his own pieces -- the Third String Quartet and the Concertino for Clarinet and String Quartet -- and Brahms's Clarinet Quintet.

(Tommasini) ZEPHYROS WINDS WITH PEDJA MUZIJEVIC (Thursday) The Baryshnikov Arts Center continues its Movado Hour series with the Zephyros Winds and the pianist Pedja Muzijevic in a program of quintets by Mozart and Beethoven and bagatelles by Ligeti.

(Midgette) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Monday through Thursday) The company opens with a gala program of tidbits from the ballets to be performed during its eight-week New York spring season. The novelty of the evening is a new pas de deux choreographed by Brian Reeder to a Chopin waltz performed live by the concert pianist Lang Lang. Then it's on to a week of ''La Bayadère,'' complete with pathetic heroines, noble but all-too-human princes, sizzlingly wicked villains and choreography that epitomizes the exquisite purity of classical ballet. The first-week lead dancers are Paloma Herrera, Angel Corella and Gillian Murphy (Tuesday); Veronika Part, Marcelo Gomes and Michele Wiles (Wednesday mati nee); Diana Vishneva, Ethan Stiefel and Stella Abrera (Wednesday night) and Ms. Herrera, David Hallberg and Ms. Murphy (Thursday).

(Claudia La Rocco) * DANCE AT THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights) SkoveWorks will perform Lily Skove's new ''Split,'' a collaboration with the lighting designer T J Hellmuth, through tomorrow. Ms. Skove compares the piece, which plays with hidden and obstructed perspectives, to a Polaroid picture in its first seconds of exposure. Chase Granoff takes over on Thursday (through May 19) with his new ''BOREDOM!!! (as an amplifier),'' with a score by Jon Moniaci. At 8, the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15; free for Queens residents on Thursday.

(Dunning) * Lawrence Goldhuber/BIGMANARTS (Wednesday and Thursday) Stravinsky and Elvis, uptown and downtown, theater and dance, drama and biting wit -- Lawrence Goldhuber knows how to bridge worlds. With a company that includes Wallie Wolfgruber, Robert La Fosse, Keely Garfield and David Parker, and a show that features three works new to New York, there should be something here for everyone. (Through May 19.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $12 and $20.

(Tonight through Sunday) This lively series ends this weekend with a single program, ''Inventors,'' featuring a young iconoclast named Christopher Williams and a sly veteran upsetter of apple carts named Douglas Dunn. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10:30, Sunday at 5:30 p.m., La MaMa e.t.c., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15; $10 for students and 65+.

(Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Peter Martins's new ''Romeo and Juliet'' will be performed through the weekend with the lead dancers Sterling Hyltin and Robert Fairchild (tonight and Sunday afternoon); Erica Pereira and Allen Peiffer (tomorrow afternoon) and Tiler Peck and Sean Suozzi (tomorrow night).

Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, newvictory.org; $12.50 to $35. (Dunning) Liz Sargent (Thursday through Sunday) In ''Revealing,'' Ms. Sargent probes issues of perception and control, employing repetitive movements that play out in Jayme del Rosario's shape-shifting creations. At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15. (La Rocco) * DOUG VARONE AND DANCERS (Thursday) Mr. Varone and his dancers have an understated but profound way with movement, music and performing. His new ''Dense Terrain,'' set to music by Nathan Larson, explores the notion of human connectedness with an emphasis on the language of words, gestures and movement. (Through May 20.) At 7:30 p.m., BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, between Ashland and Rockwell Places, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $45. (Dunning) WORLD MUSIC INSTITUTE: SONGS & SHAMAN DANCES OF MANIPUR (Tonight) Presented by the Laihui ensemble, in a United States debut, these rarely performed songs and shaman ritual dances come from ''the land of jewels,'' an isolated mountainous region in the foothills of the Himalayas that is the home of the Tibeto-Burman Meiteis people, where pure cultural traditions have been preserved. At 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, worldmusicinstitute.org; $27; $15 for students. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand's strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Roberta Smith) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Holland Cotter) * the Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Journeys: Mapping the Earth and Mind in Chinese Art,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith) * Neue Galerie: 'Van Gogh and Expressionism,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) The Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Philosophy of Time Travel,' through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world's latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Gordon MaTTA-cLARK rETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Taryn Simon,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) Galleries: 57th Street * KATHY BUTTERLY: BETWEEN A ROCK AND A SOFT PLACE Although she is a little off her game here, this extraordinarily talented ceramic sculptor continues to impress with exquisitely detailed, radiantly colored, art historically aware, discreetly lascivious little pieces, especially if you have never seen her work before. Still, the question of whether it isn't time for a change hangs over the proceedings. Tibor deNagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through May 19. (Smith) Last Chance * American Folk Art Museum: MARTíN RAMíREZ, Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color, and an unforgettable cast of characters. But most of all, he had his own brand of pictorial space. In addition to being one of the season's best exhibitions and the first of his work in a New York museum, this show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * Jo Baer Ms. Baer is best known for her immaculate early Minimalist paintings and for a 1983 statement in which she declared that the realities of post-1960s power politics had rendered abstraction irrelevant. By that point she had moved to Europe where, in her 80s, she still lives. And she had started painting the figure, which she continues to do with verve, on the evidence of this quietly vehement show. Alexander Gray Associates, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 1019, Chelsea, (212) 399-2636; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Lazhar Mansouri: 'Portraits of a Village: 1950-70' Mansouri (1932-1985) was born in northeastern Algeria and apprenticed to a local portrait photographer, then set up a studio of his own. Townspeople and neighbors came to have portraits made, either to celebrate an occasion -- a birth, a graduation, a military induction -- or to document a relationship and create personal keepsakes. The pictures at Westwood, all recent prints and larger than the originals would have been, range over 20 years. Whether approached as social and political documents or as objects of beauty, they are moving, burning, life-enlarging things. Westwood Gallery, 568 Broadway, SoHo, (212) 925-5700; closes tomorrow . (Cotter) * the Museum of Modern Art: JEFF WALL. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org, closes on Monday. (Smith) * RICHARD OELZE: PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS FROM THE 1950s & 1960s Nearly two dozen paintings in the first United States show of this little-known German Surrealist introduce an introvert with a penchant for grisaille grottolike structures that seem built on air, and for soft, fleshy forms that sometimes have eyes or reveal hidden faces or figures. Max Ernst is a big influence, and Pavel Tchelitchew an obvious analogy, but the exquisite rendering and pervasive unquiet are Oelze's alone. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'Prime Time: Mickalene Thomas and Shinique Smith' A sparkling double-header by two very different artists with much in common. In paintings encrusted with rhinestones, Ms. Thomas gives 1970s pin-up portraits of African-American women the shimmer of Byzantine mosaics. Ms. Smith turns bundles of cast-off clothes into floral bouquets of exotic patterning. Caren Golden Fine Art, 539 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-8304, carengoldenfineart.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Hunter Reynolds: 'Patina du Prey's Memorial Dress, 1993-2007' In 1993 Hunter Reynolds -- an artist and an H.I.V.-positive gay man -- first performed as his alter ego, Patina du Prey, wearing a black ball gown inscribed with thousands of names of people who had died of AIDS. There were so many names that a second gown had to be made. It is in this heartbreaking show, along with the memorial books of names collected over the years, and blank books for recording names for a new dress. In a world littered with bogus monuments, this is the real, worthy thing. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, third floor, SoHo, (212) 226-3970, artistspace.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Anne Ryan Anne Ryan sightings are infrequent these days, partly because the exquisite abstract collages that made her name in New York in the late 1940s and early '50s are scarce. There's just one in this small show at Teller, otherwise made up of prints and a few paintings. All are part of a fascinating and understudied modernist career that should be on permanent view. Susan Teller Gallery, 568 Broadway, SoHo, (212) 941-7335; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

VTennessee Titans cornerback Pacman Jones met yesterday with N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, hoping to persuade Goodell to reduce the season-long suspension he levied last month on Jones for his off-field conduct. Jones and his lawyers contended that his suspension was too harsh compared with those received by a long list of players who have been arrested or charged since 2000. Jones has been arrested 5 times and questioned by the police 10 times, but has never been convicted, since he was drafted sixth over all in 2005.

VIf running back Ricky Williams makes a comeback, it will probably be with a new team. \u201cI will not allow our fans to be let down by people that are not on our roster \u2014 not again,\u201d said Cam Cameron, the Dolphins\u2019 first year coach. An N.F.L. rushing champion for Miami in 2002, Williams, who turns 30 on Monday, tested positive for marijuana again last month, which will delay his return to the league until at least September.

VTENNIS NADAL ADVANCES TO HAMBURG SEMIFINAL -- Rafael Nadal extended his record winning streak on clay to 80 matches yesterday by defeating Fernando González, 6-4, 6-4, to reach the semifinals of the Hamburg Masters. Roger Federer also advanced, but he struggled to beat David Ferrer, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Federer faces Carlos Moyá, who defeated fourth-seeded Novak Djokovic, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 7-5. Nadal will play Lleyton Hewitt after Hewitt, playing in his first clay-court quarterfinal in three years, beat Nicolás Almagro, 6-3, 6-4. SERENA WILLIAMS LOSES IN ROME -- Serena Williams made an array of mistakes yesterday in her final match before the French Open, losing to Patty Schnyder, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (5), at the Italian Open quarterfinals in Rome. Schnyder will face third-seeded Jelena Jankovic, who routed Elena Dementieva, 6-2, 6-1. Second-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova and ninth-seeded Daniela Hantuchova will play in the other semifinal. PRO FOOTBALL WILLIAMS NOT IN DOLPHINS' PLANS -- If running back Ricky Williams makes a comeback, it will probably be with a new team. ''I will not allow our fans to be let down by people that are not on our roster -- not again,'' said Cam Cameron, the Dolphins' first year coach. An N.F.L. rushing champion for Miami in 2002, Williams, who turns 30 on Monday, tested positive for marijuana again last month, which will delay his return to the league until at least September. His current suspension began in April 2006 after he violated the league's drug policy for the fourth time. CONGRESSMAN WANTS VICK PUNISHED -- A California congressman has joined the cause against Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, writing a letter yesterday that urged N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell to ''act swiftly and forcefully'' if Vick was involved in dog fighting on his former property. The congressman, Representative Tom Lantos, Democrat of California, is a senior member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He raised the prospect of government intervention if the N.F.L. failed to discipline Vick. ''I am outraged that one of the National Football League's superstars is affiliated with such a heinous enterprise,'' Lantos wrote. BENGALS LINEBACKER ARRESTED -- Cincinnati linebacker A. J. Nicholson was arrested on a domestic violence charge yesterday, the first arrest of a Bengals player since Commissioner Roger Goodell cracked down on misconduct last month. Nicholson was already one of nine Bengals players arrested during a nine-month stretch, turning the team into a prime example of player misconduct. The police in Taylor Mill, Ky., arrested Nicholson after a woman called 911 yesterday afternoon to say that she had been assaulted by Nicholson. He was charged with fourth-degree assault, a misdemeanor. COLLEGES REVIEW FOR RULES ON PREGNANCY -- The N.C.A.A.'s committee on women in sports will review its guidelines amid reports of female athletes being threatened with the loss of scholarships if they became pregnant. Janet Kittell, the leader of the N.C.A.A.'s committee on women's athletics, said that her group would review the rules on pregnancy in July. Last week, Cassandra Harding, a member of the Memphis track team, told The Associated Press that she lost her scholarship after becoming pregnant, and a Clemson athlete told ESPN that she had an abortion to stay in college. YACHT RACING AMERICAN TEAM FALLS FURTHER BACK -- BMW Oracle Racing, the American entry, lost to the Italian boat Luna Rossa yesterday in the Louis Vuitton Cup and trails, 3-1, in their best-of-nine semifinal series in Valencia, Spain. The fifth-flight race is scheduled for today. Emirates Team New Zealand has a 3-1 advantage against Spain's Desafio Español in the other semifinal. The semifinal winners will meet in the Louis Vuitton Cup final June 1-11, with the winner advancing to sail against the defending champion, Alinghi, in the America's Cup from June 23 to July 4.

V'Shrek' Reigns Shrek got even greener over the weekend. Including Thursday previews, ''Shrek the Third'' (distributed by Paramount) grossed an estimated $122.9 million at 4,122 North American theaters in its debut, the tracking company Media by Numbers reported yesterday. Surpassing the $108 million opening of ''Shrek 2,'' the new film set a record for the most lucrative opening by an animated film and was the third-best debut ever, behind $151.1 million for ''Spider-Man 3'' and $135.6 million last year for ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.'' The weekend's ''Shrek'' performance ended the two-week reign of ''Spider-Man 3'' (Sony) at the top of the rankings. The web-slinger sequel took in $28.5 million at 4,324 theaters, bringing its three-weekend total to $281.8 million. Third place and $5.1 million went to yet another sequel, ''28 Weeks Later'' (Fox Atomic), in its second week. ''Disturbia'' (Paramount) attracted $3.6 million in its sixth week, and ''Georgia Rule'' (Universal) rounded out the top five with $3.4 million in its second week. Drama Desk Awards Honor 'Coast' Trilogy ''The Coast of Utopia,'' the Tom Stoppard trilogy about 19th-century Russia, won seven honors, including the accolade for outstanding drama, at the 2006-7 Drama Desk Awards last night at La Guardia Concert Hall at Lincoln Center. The Duncan Sheik and Steve Sater rock musical ''Spring Awakening,'' adapted from an 1891 Frank Wedekind play, won four awards, including outstanding musical. The Stephen Sondheim and George Furth musical ''Company'' was named outstanding revival of a musical, one of its three prizes, and R. C. Sherriff's 1929 play ''Journey's End,'' set in the trenches of World War I, was named outstanding revival of a play, one of its three honors. Frank Langella of ''Frost/Nixon'' and Eve Best of ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' were named best actor and actress in a play. Audra McDonald of ''110 in the Shade'' and Donna Murphy of ''LoveMusik'' tied for outstanding actress in a musical. Raúl Esparza of ''Company'' was named outstanding actor in a musical. Honors for directing went to Jack O'Brien of ''The Coast of Utopia'' and Michael Mayer of ''Spring Awakening.'' The award for outstanding solo performance went to Vanessa Redgrave for ''The Year of Magical Thinking.'' Lennon Festival In Scottish Highlands A remote village in the Scottish Highlands where John Lennon spent his childhood vacations plans to honor him with a major festival this fall, the newspaper The Scotsman reported. From Sept. 28 to 30, the village, Durness (population 350), will mount the John Lennon Northern Lights Festival, featuring music, art, dance and film. Among those scheduled to participate are Peter Maxwell Davies, the master of the queen's music, performing the world premiere of a Beatles program with the Royal Academy of Music. From ages 9 to 14, Lennon spent his summer vacations at Durness and returned there in 1969 with Yoko Ono and their family. The place is said to have inspired his song ''In My Life.'' Stanley Parkes, a cousin who shared Lennon's childhood summers in Durness and will reminisce about him at the festival, said, ''This is not about exploiting his fame; it is about celebrating his inspiration, and that is why so many leading artists and John's family have supported the event.'' Exile for George Michael? The singer George Michael, below, confessing a dependency on prescription drugs and extolling the virtues of marijuana, said he was considering exiling himself from England to avoid the scrutiny of the news media. In a television interview broadcast on Saturday, Reuters reported, he said, ''I have started thinking for the first time in my life that actually I shouldn't be here.'' Mr. Michael told the ITV talk-show host Michael Parkinson, ''I have got to think seriously about whether or not my love for my country is keeping me somewhere which is not good for me, you know.'' His agent said he had homes in London and Dallas. This month, describing himself as ''very ashamed,'' he pleaded guilty to driving while unfit and blamed his behavior on fatigue and prescription medicine. ''Yes,'' he told Mr. Parkinson, ''it involves prescribed drugs, and it involves a dependency on them.'' He attributed his behavior to the loss of his mother, Lesley, in 1997, saying, ''I know I have a very self-destructive tendency since my mother died; I have got to be honest.'' As for marijuana, he said, ''nobody ever came home stoned and beat up their wife.'' Fats Domino Back in Action Fats Domino, above, 79, who lost his home, pianos and gold and platinum records when Hurricane Katrina struck, gave his first public performance since then before a crowd of hundreds in a sold-out New Orleans nightclub on Saturday night, The Associated Press reported. Accompanied by his longtime friend and musical partner, the saxophonist Herbert Hardesty, Mr. Domino set the crowd to jumping and screaming when he belted out ''Blueberry Hill.'' The program also included ''Blue Monday,'' ''Ain't That a Shame'' and ''Walking to New Orleans.'' Mr. Domino, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is expected to move back into his home in the devastated Ninth Ward later this year. Scotty's Ashes Found The suspense is over. After a three-week search, the ashes of James Doohan, who portrayed the starship Enterprise's chief engineer, Montgomery Scott, in the original ''Star Trek'' television series, have been found, the Associated Press reported. Blasted to the edge of space aboard a rocket from New Mexico on April 29, two years after Mr. Doohan's death at 85, the capsule carrying his ashes became lost in rugged terrain on its return to Earth, and the search was impeded by foul weather. The payload landed in rocky, steep terrain in the San Andres Mountains on the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.

VThe Connecticut House of Representatives, after six hours of debate that touched on many lawmakers&#8217; own experiences with debilitating illnesses, approved a bill yesterday that would legalize the medical use of marijuana for some patients. The legislation would allow a doctor to certify that an adult patient&#8217;s use of marijuana was for medicinal purposes after determining that the patient had a debilitating condition and could benefit from it. Supporters said the bill was needed to provide legal protection to people who use marijuana to alleviate the pain of diseases like cancer and multiple sclerosis. The bill now moves to the Senate, where a similar bill passed in 2005. That bill then failed in the House. Compiled by John Sullivan.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-11 Poverty Stricken Iraqis Turn to Selling Sex in Syria For anyone living in Damascus, the fact that some Iraqi refugees are selling sex or working in sex clubs is difficult to ignore. Men freely talk of being approached by pimps trawling for customers and of women soliciting men directly, an act unthinkable in Arab culture. A1 Iran and U.S. Talk Face to Face The United States and Iran held rare face-to-face talks in Baghdad, adhering to an agenda that focused strictly on the war in Iraq and on ways they could help to improve conditions. A8 Spain Arrests 16 Moroccans Spanish police arrested 16 men, most of them Moroccans, whom they suspect of recruiting volunteers to fight in Iraq and other countries and spreading propaganda calling for Islamic jihad. A9 Kazakh Leader's Kin Is Sought Authorities in Kazakhstan have issued an international arrest warrant for Rakhat Aliyev, the son-in-law of President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev and one of the Central Asian oil state's most powerful and loathed men. A11 Violence Spikes in Afghanistan Angry supporters of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ethnic Uzbek strongman, clashed with the police in the northern town of Shiberghan, leaving at least seven people dead and 34 wounded, officials said. The government sent army units to the area, anticipating more unrest. A10 Japan Minister Hangs Himself Japan's agriculture minister, Toshikatsu Matsuoka, hanged himself just before he was to face parliamentary questioning about a political finance scandal. Analysts said the death could hurt Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's popularity ratings, which have fallen recently. A3 NATIONAL A12-16 Needle Exchange Program Alone in City's AIDS Fight Washington is the only city in the country barred by federal law from using local tax money to finance needle exchange programs. It is also the city with the fastest-growing number of new AIDS cases. The city's only needle exchange program, Prevention Works, subsists on a shoestring budget of private donations. A1 For Sale: Uranium Furious lobbying has broken out over who should end up with 25 million kilograms of uranium that the government is looking to sell. One of the companies most vocal in making its case for the uranium, estimated to be worth at least $750 million, says it should be given the material free. A12 Cancer Genome Advance Researchers say they have found six new sites of variation in the genome that increase the risk of breast cancer. Together with already known genes, the discovery means that much of the overall genetic risk of breast cancer may now have been accounted for, researchers say. A13 Anger Over Immigration Deal Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, a Republican who garners top ratings from conservative groups every year, is the unlikely linchpin to the fragile alliance of Democrats and Republicans trying to push the immigration bill through the Senate. That role has made Mr. Kyl into a lightining rod in the immigration debate. A14 Bush Speaks at Arlington President Bush used his traditional Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery to speak directly, in deeply personal terms, to the families of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, assuring them that Americans ''will never forget the terrible loss you have suffered.'' A16 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Most Powerful Leaders In New York Are at Odds Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, are like a dysfunctional power couple. The evidence of their antagonism has escalated into an extraordinarily public feud punctuated by ad hominem attacks and barbed sniping in the press. B1 Mayor Critical of Congress Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in unusually pointed and broad language, criticized Congress for parts of a comprehensive immigration bill now being debated in the Senate. B2 BUSINESS DAY C1-8 Push for Big Subsidies for Coal Even as Congressional leaders draft legislation to reduce greenhouse gases linked to global warming, a powerful roster of Democrats and Republicans is pushing to subsidize coal as the king of ''alternative fuels.'' A1 Cyberwar in a Digital Age When Estonian authorities began removing a statue of a Soviet soldier, they expected protests, but what followed was a series of cyber attacks that nearly crippled the government. Computer security experts have converged to offer help and to learn about cyberwar in the digital age. A1 Business Digest C2 ARTS E1-10 Box Office Is Pirate Booty The Memorial Day weekend affirmed the muscle of the international movie market as ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' set new industry benchmarks with an aggressive release in more than 10,000 theaters in 104 countries. E1 OBITUARIES A17 Tod Mikuriya A California psychiatrist who was widely regarded as the grandfather of the medical marijuana movement in the United States, he was 73. A17 EDITORIAL A18-19 Editorials: Make a bad bill better; getting to a Colombia trade deal; forget ethics, remember politics; Dorothy Samuels on revisiting the Wicks Law.

VDear Fans: Life Lessons à la Britney While Lindsay Lohan was heading into rehab, Britney Spears, right, was pondering life after getting out. In a ''Dear Fans'' letter posted on her Web site, britneyspears.com, she referred to attention deficit disorder when she wrote: ''Recently I was sent to a very humbling place called rehab. I truly hit rock bottom. Till this day I don't think it was alcohol or depression. I was like a bad kid running around with ADD.'' She continued: ''This letter is not to place blame on anyone, although I do see the world with a completely different set of eyes now I think the whole problem was letting too many people into my life.'' She went on to say: ''I am only 25 and I do still have a lot to learn, and I am going to make mistakes everyday, and I am sure every mistake I make will probably be on CNN or Good Morning America. I am only human people and I love you for still loving me.'' Ms. Spears decided, ''Life in general is so surreal and crazy.'' She finished by writing: ''I guess we will never really understand or figure out life completely. That's God's job. I can't wait to meet him or her.'' Two Novelists, Obscure No Longer Maybe it's not ''American Idol,'' but two agentless novelists have been plucked from obscurity and were anointed the winners yesterday of ''First Chapters,'' a writing contest sponsored by Simon & Schuster, the Borders Group and the social media site Gather.com. Besides prize money, each winner will have his novel published in the fall and receive an advance of less than $50,000. Designated the winner of the first prize of $5,000, Terry Shaw, 44, is the author of ''The Way Life Should Be,'' a mystery set in coastal Maine. Although only one winner was planned, Geoffrey Edwards, 30, was named runner-up and will receive $2,500. His novel is ''Fire Bell in the Night,'' a thriller set in the antebellum South. The contest allowed writers at no charge to submit manuscripts to Gather.com; more than 2,600 entries were narrowed to a final five. The winners were chosen by a panel including Mark Gompertz, executive vice president of Touchstone, a Simon & Schuster imprint; George Jones, chief executive of Borders, and Tom Gerace, chief executive of Gather.com. La Scala Salutes Puccini Teatro alla Scala in Milan will commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Puccini next season with productions of ''Il Trittico'' and ''La Bohème,'' Agence France-Presse reported yesterday. La Scala's director, Stéphane Lissner, said Riccardo Chailly would conduct ''Il Trittico,'' the triptych of three one-act operas comprising ''Il Tabarro,'' ''Suor Angelica'' and ''Gianni Schicchi''; and the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel would conduct ''La Bohème.'' The season will open on Dec. 7 with Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde,'' conducted by Daniel Barenboim. The Orchestre de Paris has appointed the Estonian-born American Paavo Jarvi its music director beginning in 2010, when he will succeed Christoph Eschenbach, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Jarvi, 44, is the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, the artistic director of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie in Bremen, Germany, and the principal conductor of the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra. Sentencing Set For George Michael A cocktail of drugs was in George Michael's system when he was arrested in his car last year, prosecutors told the Brent Magistrates' Court in London yesterday, the BBC reported. The prosecutor, Andrew Torrington, said the drugs included the illegal dance club drug GHB, marijuana and an antidepressant. Mr. Michael, 43, the former Wham! singer, pleaded guilty on May 8 to driving while unfit because of drugs, saying his condition was attributable to ''tiredness and prescribed drugs.'' His lawyer said a sleeping drug was the most likely explanation. District Judge Katherine Marshall said the issue was not the specific drugs but Mr. Michael's condition when found in the car after motorists reported a driver slumped over the wheel at traffic lights. Mr. Michael is to be sentenced on June 8, a day before he is to perform in the first concert at the new Wembley Stadium in London.

VThe National Research Council said it had found traces of cocaine and marijuana in the air of Rome. It said it made the discovery during a study of toxic substances in the air of Rome and the southern city of Taranto, as well as in Algiers. Small traces were found in Taranto and none in Algiers. The highest concentrations of cocaine were found in the center of Rome, and especially in the area of La Sapienza University. The report said the maximum concentration of cocaine in the city was just 0.1 nanograms per cubic meter, but nonetheless a cause for concern.

VThe authorities yesterday interrupted a sophisticated drug organization operating in Crown Heights, said Charles J. Hynes, the district attorney. Raiding several safe houses around the Brooklyn Children&#8217;s Museum, the police arrested 11 people, ranging in age from 23 to 67, on conspiracy, drug and weapons charges. Investigators secretly videotaped suspects weighing and measuring drugs, then bought or seized 2.8 pounds of cocaine and 8 pounds of marijuana, Mr. Hynes said. They also seized binoculars and radio equipment used for countersurveillance of the police.

VSelective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.

The 1980 cult roller-disco film about a Greek muse sent to earth goes Broadway -- and it's about time. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CRAZY MARY' Sigourney Weaver and Kristine Nielsen serve their specialties (WASP tartness, madcap madness) with such gusto in A. R. Gurney's comedy that it feels ungallant to point out that their characters are as artificial as hard-plastic dolls. A contrived play that never quite connects its thoughtful mind with its sentimental heart (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'ELECTRA' An ''adaptation'' of Sophocles' play that is more of a spoof of a Greek tragedy than any serious attempt to revive one (1:10). The HAS Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 868-4444.(Wilborn Hampton) 'ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER MARATHON 2007: SERIES A' Neil LaBute's contemporary gloss on a classic tale of Greek vengeance is the highlight of the first round in this annual series of short plays. Dana Delany and Victor Slezak are woman scorned and cad of a hubby in a gruesome drama that packs a visceral punch. Unfortunately, Mr. LaBute's play comes last in a mostly unrewarding program (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'FATE'S IMAGINATION' Sex and politics, a natural combination in real life, don't mesh very well in Randall David Cook's play, but his ear for humor makes this comic drama about a politician's son who has a fling with an older woman pretty entertaining anyway (1:30). Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clichéd feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Ginia Bellafante) 'HORIZON' God is in the curriculum in Rinde Eckert's lively portrait of a theologian, an homage to the ''Christian realism'' of Reinhold Niebuhr. But even the fiercest secularist should find pleasure in this engaging performance piece, set in the seminary-without-walls of one man's mind (1:25). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-8996. (Brantley) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) * 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) 'TEA' Age-blind casting is a great strength of the Pan Asian Repertory Theater's production of this play about four Japanese war brides who gather in 1968 to clean up the house of a fifth, who has killed herself. Velina Hasu Houston's play requires the five actresses to portray their characters at every stage of their lives, and it works well that some of them actually are young, while others, like Ako, who plays the uptight, more-Japanese-than-thou Atsuko, are well into middle age. But the play itself crams verbiage and melodrama into what feels like a television epic, complete with that most stereotypical of figures, the dead woman's ghost seeking liberation into the next world. The whole thing goes down like a long soap opera, though the actresses do their best to bring it all to life (1:30). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) Off Off Broadway 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'ROMEO AND JULIET' Shakespeare imagined many things, yet perhaps even he wouldn't have envisioned this classic tragedy as a musical. The director Ellen Stewart has added many new elements, but the sum remains woefully less than its parts (2:15). LaMaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Claudia La Rocco) 'TIME FLIES AND OTHERS BY IVES' An amusing collection of comic playlets by David Ives embraces the little guy (1:35). Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALL HER FACES: A PORTRAIT OF DUSTY SPRINGFIELD' There's no accounting for fans, as proved by Anthony Inneo's loving but slight tribute to Springfield. If you know the lyrics well enough to sing along, you could do worse than spend an hour listening to some of that English diva's hits, barely packaged in the shape of a play (1:15). La MaMa E.T.C. (the Club), 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (La Rocco) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'CIRKUS INFERNO' Happy lunacy (1:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912; closes on Sunday. (Gates) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'MAUD, THE MADNESS' The familiarity of many quotations from the works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson has done nothing to allay my philistine sense of that poet as dated and uneven in quality. This dramatized version of his epic poem ''Maud,'' which he termed a monodrama, does little to dispel such prejudice. Although the actor Jonathan Tindle and the director Niegel Smith have made a prodigious effort to lift Lord Alfred's words off the page, the mad Gothic protagonist they create is unappealing, and his flowery words remain a monument to an aesthetic of another time (1:30). June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101. ( Midgette) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'PHALLACY' Art and science collide in this play by Carl Djerassi, but it's not much of a mash-up; a chemist proves that a curator's prize sculpture has been misdated, and there's not much refuting the evidence (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'rosebud: the lives of orson welles' Cineastes will feel cheated by the Welsh playwright Mark Jenkins's effort to cover all the well-known triumphs and tragedies of this legendary filmmaker's life in under 90 minutes. He walks briskly and rests nowhere long enough. This is a one-man show, and Christian McKay, however, is Welles to the soles of his feet (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz) 'ANGEL-A' (R, 90 minutes) Beneath its sophisticated Gallic gloss, this handsomely photographed feel-good fantasy, which shamelessly recycles ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Heaven Can Wait,'' suggests an episode of ''Touched by an Angel'' without the tears. (Stephen Holden) * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) 'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'CRAZY LOVE' (PG-13, 92 minutes) Love is blind, and so too is Linda Pugach, one of the loony-tuners in Dan Klores's somewhat sickening, mildly gonzo documentary. In 1959 Mrs. Pugach, then 22 and known as Linda Riss, was blinded by her husband-to-be Burton Pugach, a Bronx ambulance chaser who single-mindedly pursued the object of his obsession all the way to the marriage altar. (Dargis) 'DAY WATCH' (R, 140 minutes, in Russian) Picking up a number of years after ''Night Watch'' concludes, this second installment in Timur Bekmambetov's bustling supernatural trilogy dazzles and confuses with equal determination. Less coherent than its predecessor, if equally creative, the movie depicts hidden dimensions teeming with beings who swap bodies at will and rewrite destiny with something called the Chalk of Fate. Perhaps the Fickle Finger was otherwise engaged. (Catsoulis) 'FAY GRIM' (R, 118 minutes) Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, this elaborate spy spoof, a sequel to ''Henry Fool,'' belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. Movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders. (Holden) 'THE FIFTH EMPIRE' (No rating, 127 minutes, in Portuguese) With this stubbornly static, talky drama about a young Portuguese king hoping to unite his troubled nation by embarking on a foreign adventure, the prolific 98-year-old director Manoel de Oliveira pushes his already minimalist style about as far as it can go. At the same time, though, Mr. Olivieira's aesthetic is in sync with his main interest: capturing characters' words and gestures in real time as they work through philosophical and political conundrums while remaining largely oblivious to the physical world around them. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) * 'GRACIE' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Set in New Jersey in 1978, Davis Guggenheim's sensitive underdog tale depicts the obstacles faced by a young girl who dreams of playing on her high school's all-boy soccer team. While connecting the familiar adversity-drama dots -- the beat-down, the pickup, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter -- the movie's follow-your-heart simplicity masks an unusual degree of emotional complexity. (Catsoulis) * 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) * 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott) 'MR. BROOKS' (R, 120 minutes) Kevin Costner and William Hurt camp it up as a serial killer and his demonic alter ego in ''Mr. Brooks,'' a werewolf movie masquerading as a sophisticated thriller. (Holden) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) * 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling animé isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Saltz) * 'TEN CANOES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in various Yolngu Aboriginal dialects) There is nothing more enthralling than a good yarn, and the mesmerizing ''Ten Canoes'' interweaves two versions of the same Australian Aboriginal fable, one filmed in black and white and set a thousand years ago and an even older one, filmed in color and set in prehistoric times. (Holden) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals LINDSAY ANDERSON'S MICK TRAVIS TRILOGY (Wednesday and Thursday) The British director Lindsay Anderson made three films centered on his everyman character, Mick Travis, played by Malcolm McDowell as a public school rebel in ''If '' (1968), as a disillusioned traveling coffee salesman in ''O Lucky Man!'' (1973) and finally as a hapless victim of the collapsing English health care system in ''Britannia Hospital'' (1982). Anthology Film Archives has managed to assemble all three features for rare sequential screenings -- no easy feat, because each film is controlled by a different company. The screenings begin on Wednesday with ''If '' and ''O Lucky Man!'' and continue on Thursday with ''O Lucky Man!'' and ''Britannia Hospital.'' The films continue in rotation through June 17. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Dave Kehr) SAM FULLER (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image wraps up its retrospective of the vivid, visceral work of this tabloid reporter turned filmmaker this weekend with screenings of the restored 158-minute version of his World War II epic, ''The Big Red One'' (1980), as well as three rarely shown films from Fuller's late period: ''Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street'' (1972) and ''White Dog'' (1981) tomorrow, and ''Street of No Return'' (1982) on Sunday. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE SINGER (Monday) A rare showing of Chris Marker's 1974 documentary about the French singer and political activist Yves Montand, presented with two short films by Mr. Marker, ''The Embassy'' (1973) and ''The Sixth Side of the Pentagon'' (1968). BAM Cinématek, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; bam.org; $10. (Kehr) OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA (Today through Thursday) A selection of notable recent Italian films continues tonight with the premiere of Angelo Longoni's ''Caravaggio,'' which stars Alessio Boni (''The Best of Youth'') as the tempestuous painter of the title and features cinematography by another Italian master of light and shadow, Vittorio Storaro. Among the week's other highlights: ''In Memory of Me,'' the second feature of Saverio Costanzo (''Private''), about a young man who enters an island seminary (tomorrow and Wednesday); ''Primo Levi's Journey,'' a documentary by Davide Ferrario that traces Levi's path from the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp to his home in Turin (Wednesday and Thursday); and ''See Naples and Die,'' an examination of the city in all of its glory and squalor, directed by Enrico Caria (tomorrow and Monday). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * LILY ALLEN (Tuesday) A 22-year-old British singer with deceptively sweet, ska-infused electro-pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her best when snarkily putting down disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' With Kevin Michael. At 6:45 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario) ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, BLACK MOTH SUPER RAINBOW (Tonight) If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like Architecture in Helsinki, from Australia: frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time. Black Moth Super Rainbow, from Pittsburgh, delivers shimmering psychedelia through a screen of pulsating keyboards and blissed-out, robotic vocals. With Santogold. At 9, Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) BABY GRAMPS (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday) With a gray beard the size of small shrubbery, a raspy Popeye voice and manic skills on the steel guitar, Baby Gramps offers a cartoonish variation on the role of hobo troubadour in old-timey songs like ''Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' But where he really shines is with hilarious and ingenious wordplay, as in his palindrome song (''Go hang a salami -- I'm a lasagna hog''). Tonight at 7, Terra Blues, 149 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7776, terrablues.com; $10. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. Tuesday at 8 p.m., with Kill Henry Sugar, at the Gershwin Hotel, 7 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (646) 207-0595, gershwinhotel.com; $10. (Sisario) EEF BARZELAY (Wednesday) With a homely, nasal tenor and a few lonesome strums on his guitar, Mr. Barzelay, of the band Clem Snide, can render heartache with trompe-l'oeil precision or, if the mood strikes him, simply goof off. In one song on his latest solo album, ''Bitter Honey'' (SpinArt), he takes on the persona of a woman whose rear end makes an appearance in a hip-hop video: ''It was on screen for a second but was kind of hard to miss.'' At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) BOOKER T. AND THE MG'S, SHARON JONES (Wednesday and Thursday) As the house band of Stax Records in the 1960s, Booker T. Jones and his crew had an incalculable role in the creation of Southern soul-funk, mixing musky blues with house-rocking R&B grooves built around the whirr of the organ. Sharon Jones is the queen of an active local scene that recreates, spiritedly but not too pedantically, the vintage Stax sound. Wednesday at 7 p.m., Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, rivertorivernyc.com; Thursday at noon, BAM Rhythm & Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; both free. (Sisario) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) * CARTEL (Tuesday) Those polished, punky riffs and bright singalong choruses straight out of the Blink-182 playbook are not the only signs that this Atlanta band isn't averse to blatant commercialism. Since May 24, Cartel has been inside a giant fiberglass bubble on Pier 54 in Manhattan, recording its second album in a carefully choreographed publicity stunt that involves an MTV reality show and Web tie-ins from Dr Pepper. On Tuesday the band emerges from the bubble and plays a concert on the pier. Presumably Dr Pepper will be on sale. At 6 p.m., Hudson River at 13th Street, West Village, (212) 533-7275, hudsonriverpark.org; free. (Sisario) THE CLIENTELE (Tonight) There's comfort in familiarity, and the soft, sweetly finessed songs by this veteran British indie-cabaret band, with echoes of the Byrds' gleaming folk-rock and George Harrison's breathy calm -- expertly channeled by Alasdair Maclean -- are a seductive sonic cocoon. With Beach House and Pipas. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) COWBOY JUNKIES (Wednesday) Almost 20 years ago this Toronto band released an instant classic with the somber and starkly elegant ''Trinity Session.'' And though on subsequent albums the Cowboy Junkies have never returned to that expressive peak, the delicate interplay between Margo Timmins's velvety alto and her brother Michael Timmins's muted guitar can be chillingly beautiful. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $40. (Sisario) DEFTONES (Tonight and tomorrow night) Alternately glum and explosive, this long-running alt-metal band from Sacramento plays tightly compacted guitar riffs as the singer Chino Moreno howls and croons on themes of disintegration and decay. With Dir En Grey and the Fall of Troy. At 7:30, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $27.50 (sold out tomorrow). (Sisario) DUMPSTAPHUNK (Tonight) The MySpace image for Ivan Neville's new band gives an idea of where it's coming from: the site shows a satellite picture of Hurricane Katrina about to crash into New Orleans. Funk bands are supposed to be about good times, and Dumpstaphunk, the current reigning New Orleans funk outfit, provides that in abundance. But in angry, topical songs like ''Livin' in a World Gone Mad'' it also reminds us why the good vibes are so badly needed. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $17. (Sisario) * FEIST (Monday and Tuesday) Leslie Feist, who performs under her last name, has become a genuine star of the mellow indie-arty scene with deliciously melodic songs on grown-up topics that balance pop ambitions with outsider quirkiness.

(Sisario) * HAPPY MONDAYS (Wednesday and Thursday) Working-class hedonists obsessed with the highs of trippy dance music (and with other kinds of highs), Happy Mondays embodied the ''Madchester'' rave-rock scene in Britain of the late 1980s and early '90s. In its latest reincarnation the band plays as the centerpiece of In the City of New York, a two-day conference organized by Tony Wilson, the Factory Records impresario who discovered Happy Mondays, as told in the film ''24 Hour Party People.'' At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com or inthecityofnewyork.com; $35. (Sisario) LONG BLONDES (Tomorrow) Kate Jackson of the Long Blondes, from Sheffield, England, has figured out at least one important thing about being a pop star: people listen to you when you look good. Her band has made a splash at home as much for its smart and catchy new wave update as for Ms. Jackson's vintage skirts and ''Marlene Dietrich-meets-rockabilly chic,'' as one magazine put it. With the Virgins and the King Left. At 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) BERT JANSCH (Sunday) One of the prime movers of the 1960s British folk scene, Mr. Jansch played knotty and expressive acoustic guitar that influenced Jimmy Page and Neil Young, and in songs like ''Needle of Death'' sang in an invitingly guileless voice of a bohemian demimonde. His appearance on the soundtrack to ''The Squid and the Whale'' and interest from neo-folk stars like Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart -- who both appear on his latest album, ''The Black Swan'' (Drag City) -- have introduced him to an appreciative young audience. With P. G. Six and Kevin Barker. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18.

(Kelefa Sanneh) LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO FLEETWOOD MAC (Tonight and tomorrow night) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring Loser's Lounge series, now 14, both honors and skewers pop greats with cleverly over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to soft-rock's most incestuous hitmakers. At 7 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) MELT-BANANA (Sunday) The hiccups of guitar and squeals of vocals fly by so fast in the hyperactive music of Melt-Banana, from Japan, that it seems a minor miracle that so many playful pop melodies survive. With Drop Dead and Children. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door.

(Sisario) LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Thursday) Mr. Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door.

(Sisario) JILL SCOTT (Wednesday and Thursday) Jill Scott spills out words, spoken like hip-hop poetry or sung with jazzy timing, to detail the aspirations and loves of a sensual, intelligent and self-assured woman. The R&B crooner Musiq Soulchild opens on Wednesday; on Thursday the bill is shared by a vocal powerhouse, Chaka Khan, and a current pop hitmaker, Robin Thicke. Mo'Nique is the host of these two shows at Radio City Music Hall. At 8 p.m., (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $49.50 to $69.50 on Wednesday, sold out on Thursday. (Pareles) * STEELY DAN (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature,'' and its members, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but has become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as lead guitarist. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Pareles) JOSS STONE, COMMON (Today) The self-reinvention pitch behind her third album says that Ms. Stone is over her early phase of imitating 1960s and '70s soul. But on ''Introducing Joss Stone'' (Virgin), this husky-voiced British 20-year-old still holds fast to retro sounds, this time a high-energy soul-funk tinged with hip-hop. Common, the socially conscious rapper from Chicago, will release his seventh album, ''Finding Forever,'' next month, but he's already on the campaign trail, comparing it to the work of Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye. Also on the bill for this benefit for Central Park SummerStage is Ryan Shaw, who, in a smoking version of Wilson Pickett's ''I Found a Love,'' does the soul-revival thing as well as can be done. At 5 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171, summerstage.org; $40. (Sisario) MARY TIMONY BAND (Thursday) Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces.

(Chinen) THE FOUR BAGS/BROOKLYN QAWWALI PARTY (Sunday) The instrumental palette of the Four Bags -- trombone, accordion, guitar and reeds -- suits their modern sort of chamber jazz. Brooklyn Qawwali Party, which plays a later set, uses a more percussive assortment of instruments to create its caffeinated take on the Sufi devotional music of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. At 7 and 9 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10.

Opera 'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In its heyday on Bleecker Street, Amato Opera was where young New Yorkers saw their first operas; in its current home on the Bowery, it has taken on a certain quality of camp. But its loyal fans still love it, and it still loves opera, and offers Verdi with all of that love, so that some of the spirit of the opera comes across almost in spite of the variable skills of its performers. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) MET IN THE PARKS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Opera companies are always drumming up new ways to attract a big audience. But the crowds that flock, picnic in tow, to New York city parks for the Metropolitan Opera's annual outdoor summer performances seem to need little enticement. This month the Met is offering ''La Bohème'' and ''Faust.'' At ''Bohème'' on Tuesday, Gareth Morrell conducts Hei-Kyung Hong as Mimì, Mary Dunleavy as Musetta, Roberto Aronica as Rodolfo, Dwayne Croft as Marcello, Jeff Mattsey as Schaunard and Andrew Gangestad as Colline.

Tomorrow afternoon Julia Zilberquit plays piano music by Liadov, Medtner, Rachmaninoff and Tcherepnin, and tomorrow evening and on Sunday afternoon, Dmitry and Anya Alexeev pick up this Russian thread in a program of piano works by Balakirev, Liadov and Medtner, with a piano four-hands version of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' as its conclusion.

(Allan Kozinn) CONNECTICUT EARLY MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight and Sunday) This annual three-week feast of early music, slightly spare yet charming in the best New England tradition, begins this weekend with what you could call song and dance. Tonight the vocal trio Liber Unusualis performs mystical songs from the 14th and 15th centuries; on Sunday Vivaldi's complete ''Estro Armonico,'' a groundbreaking sequence of 12 concerti, will be performed in the original chamber instrumentation.

(Schweitzer) * EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) For their Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, these superb musicians are presenting a complete cycle of the Beethoven quartets, but in a much larger framework. These seminal works are being performed alongside pieces by composers from Bach to Kaija Saariaho, whose ''Terra Memoria'' has been commissioned especially for this occasion. Sunday's program juxtaposes Beethoven's ''Harp'' and ''Serioso'' Quartets with works by Anton Webern and Bartok's teeming Third Quartet. The Emerson, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary with this series, sounded in top form for the first concert. The one drawback is Carnegie Hall, which for all its acoustical glory, is not an ideal space for an intimate string quartet experience. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $79. (Anthony Tommasini) * ENSEMBLE ACJW (Tomorrow) Earlier this year Carnegie Hall, the Weill Music Institute and the Juilliard School jointly instituted a visionary program to train outstanding young musicians on the verge of professional careers and integrate them into the music programs of selected New York City public schools. The emerging artists have been showcased this spring in several concerts at Carnegie Hall. The next one is tomorrow night, an exciting and ambitious program with large-scale works by Webern, Ligeti, Henri Dutilleux, Mauricio Kagel and John Adams (the Chamber Symphony). But the sponsors should strongly consider coming up with a better name for this talented roster of players. At 7 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org, $15. (Tommasini) MANNES BEETHOVEN INSTITUTE (Tonight) This weeklong program of instruction, lectures and concerts, which ends on Sunday, has been dealing mainly with Beethoven's chamber music.

Mr. Muti reappears with a new program of Rossini, Schubert and Dvorak on Thursday.

It denotes women who have sufficiently freed themselves of the stigma of being female -- evidently still something of a handicap in a field that remains around 80 percent male -- to achieve success. They include Jennifer Higdon, Libby Larsen and Joan Tower, who has organized the whole festival as a way to promote discussion and, on a practical level, a new burst of ''old-girl'' networking. The first performance of a commissioned work by Kati Agócs is also on the program. Tomorrow at 2 p.m., Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; Sunday at 3 p.m.,Dia:Beacon, Beacon, N.Y., (212) 594-6100, oslmusic.org; $20. (Midgette) WESTERN WIND (Tonight) This vocal ensemble has performed an enormous repertory over the years, from ancient to modern works, with occasional excursions into pop and theater music offsetting their more typical classical programs. Its current program is all contemporary music, and includes the world premiere of ''Basket Rondo,'' written for the group by Meredith Monk. Scores by Philip Glass, Tania León, William Bolcom, Robert Dennis, Matthew Harris, Eric Salzman, Gayla D. Morgan and one of the ensemble's singers, Elliot Z. Levine, are also included. At 8, Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 873-2848, westernwind.org; $25; $15 for students and 65+.

(Claudia La Rocco) RISA JAROSLOW (Thursday) Ms. Jaroslow's solo, ''A Jew in Poland,'' addresses the destruction of old Jewish communities in that country. It is being performed in connection with an exhibition, ''And I Still See Their Faces: The Vanished World of Polish Jews,'' and will be followed by a discussion with the choreographer-performer. At 7 p.m., Yeshiva University Museum, 15 West 16th Street, Flatiron district, (917) 606-8200, yumuseum.org; $8; $6 for students and 65+.

This week catch Ivy Baldwin, Sujin Lee and Paul Singh. At 8 p.m., 55 Washington Square South, South Village, (212) 598-0551, movementresearch.org; Free. (La Rocco) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The big news is the premiere tonight of Christopher Wheeldon's new work ''The Nightingale and the Rose,'' set to music by Bright Sheng, the company's resident composer, and starring Wendy Whelan, Sara Mearns and Tyler Angle. Tonight's program, ''Tradition and Innovation,'' also includes Peter Martins's ''Jeu de Cartes'' and ''Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze' '' and, oddly, the Rosenkavalier section of ''Vienna Waltzes,'' by George Balanchine. Other programs are the ''one-time-only'' combination of Mr. Wheeldon's new ballet, Balanchine's ''Union Jack'' and ''Rubies'' from Balanchine's ''Jewels,'' danced for the first time by Megan Fairchild and the delicious Joaquin De Luz. Completing the week's repertory are ''Three By Bach'' (Balanchine's ''Concerto Barocco,'' Christopher d'Amboise's ''Tribute'' and Jerome Robbins's ''Brandenburg''), tomorrow night; ''Essential Balanchine'' (''Walpurgisnacht Ballet,'' ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements,'' on Sunday); the Balanchine classic ''Jewels'' (Tuesday and Thursday); and ''Balanchine and Robbins: Masters at Work'' (Balanchine's ''Raymonda Variations'' and ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' and Robbins's ''Dybbuk,'' on Wednesday. (Through June 24.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p. m. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $86. (Dunning) NOCHE FLAMENCA (Tonight through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) It's back, with a new piece called ''Aldaba'' and the company star, Soledad Barrio, she of unfailing fire. (Through July 29.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 5 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 352-3101, theatremania.com; $55. (Dunning) JODY OBERFELDER DANCE PROJECTS (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Oberfelder, known for her acrobatic, high-energy dance mixed with glints of humor, will present her new ''Heavy Light,'' inspired by Horace Walpole's notion that life is a comedy for thinkers and a tragedy for those who feel, and ''The Title Comes Last,'' in which performers travel from a workaday world into ''a land of vibrancy.'' Take us with you. (Through June 17.) At 7 p.m., The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org; $20; $12 for students and 65+; $175 to $250 for the gala on Wednesday, including reception and postperformance dinner. (Dunning) Pascal Rioult Dance Theater (Tuesday through Thursday) The company celebrates its 15th anniversary with two premieres, including ''EXP#1,'' set to an electronic score, as well as the return of ''If by Chance'' and ''Black Diamond.'' (Through June 17.) Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $38. (La Rocco) SENS/NOÉMIE LAFRANCE (Thursday) Ms. Lafrance, known for visually dramatic site-specific dance, will present performances of a work in progress called ''Rapture,'' in which dancers travel across stainless-steel roofs and walls in a response to the architectural design of Frank Gehry's Fisher Center. (Through June 16.) At 8 p.m., Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, Annandale on the Hudson, N.Y., (575) 758-7900, fishercenter.bard.edu. (Dunning) STREB SLAM (Tonight through Sunday) High-flying, wall-crashing thrills and chills, and popcorn besides. (Through June 17.)

(Dunning) NINA WINTHROP AND DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday) Dancers will perform Ms. Winthrop's ''Constraints I, II & III.''

Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 3 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * brooklyn museum: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this assembly of pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Michael Kimmelman) * International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cézanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) * THE MET: 'Poiret: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) * El Museo del Barrio: 'The Disappeared (Los Desaparecidos),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'Richard Serra Sculpture: 40 Years,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in work he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman) THE NATIONAL ACADEMY: '182ND ANNUAL: AN EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY ART,' through July 24. The National Academy has mounted annual exhibitions showcasing living American artists (as opposed to dead Europeans) since it was founded in 1826. The annuals now alternate between invitationals, including nonmembers, and years devoted to academicians, professional artists elected by their peers to be members of the National Academy. This is a members-only year, which means that the work is more conservative -- or ''traditional,'' if you like. Heavily weighted toward painting, the exhibition includes lots of heirs to Abstract Expressionism and scores of competent figurative paintings and Expressionist- and Impressionist-inspired still lifes and landscapes. Among the participants are Philip Pearlstein, William Bailey, Will Barnet, Melvin Edwards, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Richard Estes and Lois Dodd. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: Matthew Brannon, 'Where Were We,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Summer of Love: Art of the PsychedElic Era,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown 'CONCEPTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1964-1989' By now some of the freewheeling, sometimes prankish specimens of photography styled Conceptual, rampant in the '60s and '70s, have become classics, as this wide-ranging show proves. The more than 35 projects on view, drawn from a private collection, include works by many of the usual suspects: Vito Acconci, Bruce Nauman, Giuseppe Penone, John Baldessari and Charles Ray. Among those on display here that have stood the test of time are Nauman's witty explorations of his body, like ''Self-Portrait as Fountain'' (1966); Ray's ''Plank Piece I, II'' (1973), in which he helps a board make sculpture of his body; and Penone's ''To Reverse One's Eyes'' (1970), embellishing his sight through lenses made of mirrors. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through June 23. (Glueck) 'CROSSCURRENTS: DURER TO PICASSO' A show of prints and drawings that makes imaginative pairings of older works with those of 20th-century artists who are sometimes cued by their contemporaries as well as their ancestors. The evidence is keen in, for example, Hieronymus Bosch's ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' (1561), a fervidly drawn scene of grotesque beings and fantastic doings placed near two later Surrealist renditions: a biomorphic figment by Andre Masson, ''The Genius of the Species'' (1942), and Salvador Dalí's etching ''Landscape in the Manner of Arcimboldo'' (1934), a biomorphic-geometric vision. A beguiling show. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 570-0090, through June 15. (Glueck) 'SUBLIME CONVERGENCE: GOTHIC TO THE ABSTRACT' This gathering of old master and contemporary paintings reminds us how the art of the past can resonate with that of the present. The emphasis is on the spiritual, with objects by a number of medieval gold-ground painters -- who covered panels with gold leaf to form a radiant background for their imagery -- dramatically displayed along with more recent art of a meditative nature. (Gregorian chant plays softly in the background.) One salient example is Taddeo di Bartolo's ''St. Francis of Assisi'' (about 1395), with its simple Gothic niche as background for the saint in his nuanced bluish-gray robe, accompanied by Brice Marden's ''Number 1'' (1963), another Minimalist composition of four gridded rectangles, each bluntly painted in a shade of gray, that seems to reflect the intensity of the earlier picture. Comparisons like this can go awry, but for the most part this show works. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through June 15. (Glueck) Galleries: 57th Street * PICASSO, BRAQUE AND EARLY FILM IN CUBISM Cubism and the first moving pictures emerged in the same decade. Coincidence? This thrilling exhibition doesn't think so. A dense display of major paintings, collages and prints; antique cameras and projectors; and snippets of film that Braque and Picasso are thought to have seen, it examines Cubism in the dim light and flickering images of the movie theater. It is radically reorienting to consider Cubism's fractured, revolving forms and transparencies as partly influenced by moving pictures. A few of the pictures even resemble movie cameras. Weirdest of all? Thinking of Analytical Cubism's pale, gleaming dabs of paint as dust motes caught in the projector's beam. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, through June 23. (Smith) Marc Quinn: 'Sphinx' This amusing, if somewhat disturbing, show presents Kate Moss as equal parts classical Greek sculpture, yoga devotee and SuperModel. It strikes a particularly contemporary chord in the way it addresses contemporary society's obsession with looking good and its confusion about how to get the inside (feelings, spirit, thoughts) to match the outside. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Galleries: SoHo TINA BARNEY: CHINA VISIT Tina Barney's last series of photographs featured a nearly extinct species, the European aristocracy, while her new works look to China. Most of the photographs feature members of the creative class, from actors and dancers to a jingle composer, although several juxtapose the ''old'' China with the ''new,'' Westernized version, seen through the filter of opera performers or female golf caddies posed against an urban backdrop. These are more posed and less intimate than Ms. Barney's photographs of her own upper-crust East Coast tribe, which made her famous in the 1980s. But the implications of this project are obvious, with China's growing position on the world's political and economic stages. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, www.janetbordeninc.com; through June 16. (Schwendener) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS bilder Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) Last Chance JOAQUÍN TORRES-GARCÍA: 'paintings and drawings, 1920-1942' This choice exhibition concentrates on small, lively ink drawings from the early 1930s, when Torres-García ironed out Cubism into a compartmentalized grid that could either be abstract -- like Mondrian's work -- or a container for assorted symbols and hieroglyphs. Two earlier paintings underscore that, either way, his inspiration came from combined order and disorder of bustling city views. CDS Gallery, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' . This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Smith) YAYOI KUSAMA: FROM HERE TO INFINITY Spanning 50 years, this 24-piece overview is notable for its high quality and for unfamiliar works that sharpen the understanding of this artist's protean talent, among them several small, pungently colored folk-arty paintings that deploy her signature (and obsessive) webs, dots and scale patterns as effectively as her more abstract works do. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190; closes today. (Smith) MARGUERITE ZORACH: A LIFE IN ART The first solo show in more than 30 years of a pioneer of European modernism in America contains 35 paintings -- landscapes, portraits and still lifes -- ranging in date from 1910 to the mid-1960s. They're not all equally good, but they all have a quality of grit, intelligence and striving that never falters. The next show should also include her textiles and works on paper. Gerald Peters Gallery, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760, www.gpgallery.com; closes today. (Smith)

Behind her, projected on a big screen, were photos of her son, Ian, from their family album: Ian as a newborn with his mom. Ian getting his black belt in karate. Ian playing his trumpet in the marching band. Ian beaming at the camera the year he was voted most popular fifth grader. Ian standing happily with his older sister, Candace, who has Down syndrome. Ian playing baseball. Ian, the third-highest scorer on his high school lacrosse team. Ian with his beautiful date at the senior prom. Ian being handed his high school diploma. Ian, the honors college student.

VINTERNATIONAL A2-11 New Plan to Arm Sunnis Against Qaeda Militants With the four-month-old buildup of American troops showing only modest success in curbing insurgent attacks, American commanders are turning to another strategy that they acknowledge is fraught with risk: arming Sunni Arab groups that have promised to fight militants linked to Al Qaeda -- in many cases, their former allies. A1 Iraq's leading political blocs agreed to remove the speaker of Parliament from his position after accusations that his bodyguards assaulted a Shiite lawmaker as the speaker cursed him. Members of Parliament and a spokesman for the speaker's party confirmed the assault and the plans for removal. A6 Gaza Infighting and Air Strikes The Israeli Air Force struck at least two buildings in Gaza City in what appeared to be a response to a raid across the Gaza-Israel border by Palestinian militants. Also, internal violence between the main rival Palestinian organizations, Hamas and Fatah, flared again in the Gaza Strip, with at least four people killed over the weekend. A9 Flooding in China Kills 66 Torrential rains in southern China have unleashed surging floodwaters that have swept through small cities and farming villages, claiming at least 66 lives, forcing nearly 600,000 people to be relocated and destroying millions of dollars in property, the state news media reported. A11 Bush Tour Reaches Albania President Bush's visit to Albania was the fifth stop on his eight-day, six-country swing through Europe. The first sitting president to visit the country, he told the Albanians that he supported their effort to join NATO and wanted independence soon for Kosovo without making any fresh commitments. A3 Sri Lankan Rights Panel Report An international panel appointed by the government of Sri Lanka has issued a stark indictment of a presidential commission intended to investigate serious human rights violations, saying that its activities so far ''do not satisfy international norms and standards.'' A11 NATIONAL A12-17 State Budgets Get Boost From Booming Economy State lawmakers across the country have found themselves with more money than they planned as they wind down their regular sessions. Burned by several years of shortfalls, states have kept their estimates of total revenues on the conservative side and are now reaping plenty from higher than expected tax collections and booming local economies. A1 Mixed Views of Romney Bid To many Mormons, Mitt Romney's bid for the presidency is both a proud sign of progress and a cause of real trepidation. Even his many Mormon supporters find the moment fraught with anxiety because his candidacy is bringing intense scrutiny to their church and could worsen longstanding bigotry. A1 Repatriation of the Dead The repatriation of remains has become increasingly commonplace as towns across Mexico have sent their children to find work in the United States. As debate rages in Congress over a proposed immigration law, the journey of the dead suggests that for many Mexicans the sojourn in the United States, legal or not, is meant to be temporary. A1 Immigration Unresolved Senate Democrats opened the door to reviving the stalled immigration measure, calling on Republicans to resolve their internal divisions and produce an agreement on how to move the legislation forward. Republican critics of the bill have called for more chances to eliminate provisions they describe as amnesty. A12 Transit Expansion Project After operating for 32 years, efforts are under way to expand the transit system designed to shuttle between West Virginia University's two campuses, which sit two miles apart. At a cost of up to $40 million a mile, the expansion would extend the system, once derided as a waste of money but now relied on by the city of Morgantown. A12 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Medical Marijuana Bill Advances in Connecticut On June 1, the Connecticut State Senate, following the House, passed a bill that allows people with certain medical conditions to grow as many as four marijuana plants for ''palliative use.'' It is unclear whether Gov. M. Jodi Rell will sign the bill, which would make Connecticut the 13th state in the nation to permit marijuana for medical purposes. B1 Border Rules May Hurt Tourism Many people in the Niagara Falls tourism industry fear that a set of new rules suggested by the 9/11 Commission requiring Americans traveling by land or sea to Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and the Caribbean to present a passport could discourage millions of visitors from crossing the border and result in billions of dollars a year in lost revenue. B1 The Pull of Homelessness After reading an article about Johnny Five, a homeless man who lived beneath an abandoned train station in the Bronx, a nonprofit group arranged for him to move into an apartment. But for the next several months, Johnny would drift between his old life and his new one. B1 ARTS E1-10 Two Big Winners at Tonys ''The Coast of Utopia,'' Tom Stoppard's eight-and-a-half-hour epic, was the big winner at the 61st annual Tony Awards, setting the record for the most awards won by any play in Tony history. Meanwhile, the musical ''Spring Awakening,'' won best book, score, direction and choreography and best featured actor. E1 OBITUARIES B7 Richard Rorty A scholar whose inventive work on philosophy, politics, literary theory and more made him one the of world's most influential contemporary thinkers, he was 75. B7 John P. McGovern A Houston real-estate investor whose philanthropy helped endow medical facilities at Duke University and other institutions, he was 85. B7 BUSINESS DAY C1-8 Editor Leaves Publisher Daniel Menaker, the executive editor in chief of the Random House Publishing Group, is leaving the company at the end of June. C1 Agency Loses Big Client Creative Artists Agency has tried expanding its client base from mainstream entertainment companies to a widening ring of customers, but the loss of Hasbro in the month before the release of the movie ''Transformers'' is an example of how cruel the corporate world can be.

VMANY states nationwide are considering legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana. Last week, one such bill cleared both houses in Connecticut (but at press time had not yet been signed by the governor), New York appears likely to follow suit and New Jersey has two bills with bipartisan support. Indeed, a number of states have had similar measures in play over the last year, in addition to the 12 that have already passed such laws. The picture is very different at the federal level, where marijuana is branded as an illegal drug. An amendment to a recent drug safety bill would require all purveyors of state-authorized medical marijuana to be subject to Food and Drug Administration regulation. The senator who introduced this amendment said that making any drug available without F.D.A. review or proof of safety and effectiveness would set a dangerous precedent that would threaten patient safety. Marijuana advocates have opposed the bill, because it would close medical marijuana cooperatives and create barriers to the use of the drug.

VMANY states nationwide are considering legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana. Last week, one such bill cleared both houses in Connecticut (but at press time had not yet been signed by the governor), New York appears likely to follow suit and New Jersey has two bills with bipartisan support. Indeed, a number of states have had similar measures in play over the last year, in addition to the 12 that have already passed such laws. The picture is very different at the federal level, where marijuana is branded as an illegal drug. An amendment to a recent drug safety bill would require all purveyors of state-authorized medical marijuana to be subject to Food and Drug Administration regulation. The senator who introduced this amendment said that making any drug available without F.D.A. review or proof of safety and effectiveness would set a dangerous precedent that would threaten patient safety. Marijuana advocates have opposed the bill, because it would close medical marijuana cooperatives and create barriers to the use of the drug.

VWhen the Assembly passed a bill last week that legalized the ''medical use of marihuana,'' copy editors across the state did a double take. Shouldn't that be spelled with a ''j'' instead of an ''h''? ''Marijuana'' is standard usage, but ''the public health law and the penal law have always spelled it with an 'h' ,'' explained Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, the sponsor of the bill. (The Senate version has not come up for a vote.) ''That's the official New York State statutory spelling.''

VThe Alaska high school student who unfurled a 14-foot banner with the odd message ''Bong Hits 4 Jesus'' insisted that it was a banner about nothing, a prank designed to get him and his friends on television as the Olympic torch parade went through Juneau en route to the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. The school's principal insisted, to the contrary, that the banner advocated, or at least celebrated, illegal drug use, and that the student, Joseph Frederick, should be punished for displaying it. She suspended him for 10 days.

VHere's a conservative who's against the commutation of Scooter Libby's prison sentence: Dallas Morning News columnist Rod Dreher, who digs up a seemingly hypocritical quote from President Bush's 1999 campaign biography, "A Charge to Keep." In it, Bush wrote, "I don't believe my role is to replace the verdict of a jury with my own unless there are new facts or evidence of which a jury was unaware, or evidence that the trial was somehow unfair." Dreher writes on Crunchy Con, his Beliefnet blog:

VMoments after an irate judge in London issued an arrest warrant, the wayward British pop singer Pete Doherty turned up in court yesterday. He pleaded guilty to possessing crack, heroin, marijuana and ketamine, as well as two driving offenses, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Doherty, 28, also pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to appear in court without a reasonable excuse. The drug and driving charges date from May 5, when he was stopped in a car in central London.

VA marijuana advocate will not spend time in prison despite a conviction for growing and distributing hundreds of marijuana plants, a federal judge ruled. The man, Ed Rosenthal, 63, was convicted in May on three cultivation and conspiracy charges. But the judge, Charles Breyer of Federal District Court, said a one-day prison sentence was punishment enough for Mr. Rosenthal, who said he planned to appeal his conviction. \u201cI should not remain a felon,\u201d he said. Mr. Rosenthal was convicted on the same charges four years ago. Judge Breyer sentenced him to one day in prison because Mr. Rosenthal reasonably believed he was immune from prosecution because he was acting on behalf of Oakland city officials. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned that 2003 conviction and ordered a retrial because of juror misconduct.

V9 P.M. (Lifetime) STATE OF MIND File this one under &#8220;didn&#8217;t see it coming.&#8221; The ever-affecting Lili Taylor stars in this new drama about a New Haven psychiatrist whose life goes into a nose dive when she catches her husband cheating on her with their couples therapist. Now it&#8217;s time to pull up and level off. Devon Gummersall (above right with Ms. Taylor) plays the young lawyer she brings in to fill her spouse&#8217;s office space. Derek Riddell, Theresa Randle and Mido Hamada play her mostly supportive doctor colleagues. Kevin Chamberlin (above left) plays the office manager who&#8217;s a doctor in his own mind.

VMourning for Tom Snyder, the late night TV host who died at 71, is quickly being volunteered across the Web, much like he volunteered his own tidbits seemingly unfit for the formal TV interview format, at least before he helped change that.

VThe police must have a reasonable suspicion of criminal wrongdoing before asking for permission to search a disabled car, the State Supreme Court ruled yesterday. In a 6-to-1 ruling, the court held that marijuana and cocaine found by a state trooper under the hood of a disabled car in 2004 could not be used as evidence against its occupants. In that case, the trial judge found that the evidence could not be admitted because the trooper was acting on \u201cnothing more than a hunch.\u201d An appeals panel reversed the decision, but a majority of the Supreme Court justices found that there was credible evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s opinion that no reasonable suspicion of a crime existed to justify the search.

Not hippie weirder, though I did expect a bit of that, but nerdy weirder. So I was surprised at how extraordinarily normal everyone looked."

VA police officer was dragged by a car in Williamsbridge early yesterday after he tried to question the driver, whom he suspected of using drugs, the police said. The officer, who was not identified by the police, then shot the driver in the left leg, the police said. The officer had approached the car, at East 228th Street and White Plains Road, on foot about 1 a.m., believing two men in it were smoking marijuana. The car was driven off, and the officer was caught and briefly dragged, the police said. Investigators said the two men were seen throwing marijuana and cocaine from the moving vehicle, which police officers stopped after it had gone about two blocks. The officer was treated for minor injuries at St. Barnabas Hospital, and the driver was in stable condition at Jacobi Medical Center, the police said. Charges against the two men in the car, whose identities were not disclosed, were pending late yesterday, the police said.

VThere are a lot of dead birds in Hyde Park. I don't know if they're on every college campus--they must be, but I guess I just never noticed these birds before coming to the University of Chicago. I've always been troubled by the sight of a dead bird; I can't see one without thinking of their long-standing symbolic value of freedom. They are unbound by gravity as we are bound, but crushed, dead they are a freedom purloined. This removal of freedom is a starting point for the transformation of the college experience from the 1960s. College cannot be what it once was; the collectivity of the college lifestyle has disintegrated to a singular experience in which it has become impossible to care outside of oneself. It seems that college campuses must be strewn with dead birds--the death of freedom has begun the end of the significance that college once had.

VThe problem with college is that we expected it to be as revolutionary a time as our parents' movies and songs promised it would be and, sadly, it isn't. We arrived on campus, ready to grow our hair out, desperate for anything to sit-in against, but quickly discovered that there's no single abhorrent thing worth the sit-in. We quickly found that the professors aren't reactionary at all - quite the opposite, honestly. We looked for something local we could fix, but found nothing new. There is no pressing Civil Rights battle on our campuses, there is no obvious sexual segregation. Really, the only quantifiable difference between college now and college then is that the marijuana is 17% stronger and now the Republicans smoke it too.

One night we were particularly tired and decided to camp on church grounds. Of course, the groundskeeper discovered us and ushered a policeman. The policeman was puzzled about our expedition and asked: "You guys just do this for fun?" I replied, "We're just college students." Looking relieved, the policeman let us sleep.

VAs baby boomers settle into middle-age, many watch their children enter what they sentimentalize as the best years of their life: their college years. With memories of picket signs and protests, many recall their outrageous behavior during that idealistic time. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson sat down with a pen in his hand, and almost exactly just short of two centuries later America again saw unrelenting idealism: the college student of the 1960's and 70's.

VIt became a sanctuary. I sat on the floor with all the appropriate paperwork and books surrounding me in a large circle, placing myself in the center of everything. I did it almost unconsciously, flipping through the college guidebooks that had become my treasure maps, my compass to Shangri-la. I only looked for small schools, for big castle-like buildings, a teacher ratio of 10 to 1, and lots and lots of trees. I wanted a college version of my California high school where some students did not wear shoes, boys grew their hair long, and teachers lay out in the grass eating their vegetarian lunches. In December of my senior year of high school I imagined college to be this haven of intellectual stimulation where everyone drinks coffee and mulls over the meaning of life.

VThe elevator finally gets to my floor. I get off and start walking down the hall to my dorm room. As I pass room 402, I hear Akon being blasted on the stereo, room 404 has their daily porn playing on their flat screen TV, and the two girls living in 406 are glued to the television watching Jerry Springer. I inch my way towards my room and hear All You Need is Love. I must have forgot to turn off my music before heading to class. When I open my door, I'm greeted by my Woodstock poster and my tapestry of elephants and peace signs that stretches across my wall. My dad always tells me I should have been in college in the 1960's or 70's. I think he's right.

VCollege as America used to understand it is coming to an end. Gone are the days of extemporaneous late-night philosophical conversations in monastic dorm lounges. Instead, colleges these days are brimming with kids who, rather than asking the fundamental questions of humanity, obsess about how they are going to fit into the economy after graduation. This is the sordid state of college in America nowadays. According to Rick Perlstein, anyway. But does his depiction reflect reality? Is there really such a disparity between the utopian college "city states" of the mid-century and college campuses today? I think not.

VLast Thanksgiving - between bites of turkey - the topic transitioned to Disney. Beauty and the Beast was set to close on Broadway, and my cousin John urged the family to rush to see the show. Unmoved, my grandfather observed that Beauty and the Beast could never approach Pinocchio. My mother chimed that Cinderella would always be her favorite. My youngest cousin impetuously gushed that Cars was just about the best thing ever. His slightly older brother preferred Finding Nemo.

VWhen my mother and grandmother came to visit me at UC Santa Cruz this spring, I expected them to feel as any parent and grandparent should on a college campus: out of place, uncomfortable, quaintly bewildered. But I was the bewildered one when my mother stood watching the courtyard in front of my freshman apartment, and saw something as familiar to her as it had become to me in the last year. Three nineteen year old males, with long limp hair and slouching lean bodies to match, were tossing a Frisbee in lazy arcs. Two were shirtless; the third wore a tie-dyed Grateful Dead t-shirt. Three generations of women stood to the side, observing. Before I got too embarrassed and herded my ancestors away, my mother turned to hers and asked, "Mom, doesn't this remind you of the seventies?" She nodded emphatically, adding "Mhhmm. You're right."

V"President Bush vetoed the children's health insurance bill today, as he had promised to do, setting the stage for more negotiations between the White House and Congress," The Times reported today. "The bill was approved by Congress with unusual bipartisan support, as many Republicans who side with the president on almost everything else voted to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or Schip, from its current enrollment of about 6.6 million children to more than 10 million."

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had long advocated extra pay to reward high-performing teachers, but as Elissa Gootman notes in a front-page article, the new plan is really "a twist on the traditional concept of merit pay."

VThe British pop singer Amy Winehouse was arrested in Bergen, Norway, for possession of marijuana, the BBC reported. Ms. Winehouse, her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, and a third person were taken into custody at a hotel and held overnight after being found with a quarter-ounce of the drug, a prosecutor said. She was released on Friday morning after paying a fine of 500 euros ($715). The prosecutor, Lars Morten, told The Associated Press, \u201cShe\u2019s paid the fine, so this thing is over for us now.\u201d Her spokesman, Shane O\u2019Neill, said, \u201cShe was released without charge,\u201d and added that her European tour would continue. Ms. Winehouse canceled concerts this year amid newspaper reports that she was in a rehab clinic.

VRobert E. Chambers Jr., who became known to New Yorkers as the "preppy killer" after the 1986 killing of Jennifer Levin in Central Park, pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in her death in 1988. He served 15 years in prison. Now Mr. Chambers, 41, is in serious legal trouble again, along with his girlfriend, Shawn Kovell, 39. After neighbors complained about a constant stream of strangers to and from the pair's apartment in a building on East 57th Street, the police mounted an undercover operation. Over the course of three months, the authorities said, officers bought 246 grams of cocaine for $9,600 from Mr. Chambers and Ms. Kovell, an amount that could fetch $20,000 on the street.

VBrooklyn prosecutors said they would drop the murder case against a retired F.B.I. supervisor, Roy Lindley DeVecchio, after tapes discredited the main witness, a gangster's mistress. The tapes came to light in a report in The Village Voice by the reporter Tom Robbins that showed that the main witness, Linda Schiro, had changed her account and damaged her credibility.

VThe lawyer for the British pop singer Amy Winehouse, below, said yesterday that she will appeal her fine last month for marijuana possession in Norway because she did not understand that under Norwegian law, accepting a fine amounts to pleading guilty, The Associated Press reported. The lawyer, Ole Kvelstad, contended that she had been questioned without legal representation or an interpreter and had not understood the Norwegian-language charges she signed. He said that pleading guilty in a drug case could have serious consequences when Ms. Winehouse, who has spoken openly about her taste for marijuana and alcohol, seeks to enter the United States. Police Attorney Rudolf Christoffersen of Bergen said she was questioned by an English-speaking officer, who translated the charges and explained the consequences of accepting the fine. Ms. Winehouse and her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, were arrested in Bergen on Oct. 18 and held overnight on charges of illegal drug possession. They were released the next morning after paying fines of $715 each for possessing a quarter-ounce of marijuana.

VUpdated, 4:10 p.m. | The relationships between bosses and their personal assistants can be emotionally intense, to say the least. So we're sure a hot topic in many an office today is the arrest of the 26-year-old personal assistant to Linda Stein, the well-connected real estate agent who was bludgeoned to death on Oct. 30 in her Fifth Avenue apartment. According to the police, the assistant, Natavia Lowery, said Ms. Stein had yelled at her, waved an exercise stick at her and blown marijuana smoke into her face.

VA former city police officer who helped his brother distribute vast quantities of cocaine and marijuana throughout the New York area from 2002 to 2005 was sentenced in Federal District Court to 10 years in prison yesterday. The former officer, Jose Torrado, 32, of the Bronx, pleaded guilty earlier this year to drug trafficking charges. Mr. Torrado joined the Police Department in 2001 and resigned in 2006 amid an investigation into his crimes. While serving with the department, Mr. Torrado worked with a criminal group that smuggled drugs from Mexico to New York in trucks, prosecutors have said.

VA 33-year-old man was arrested yesterday after he fired at police officers who were trying to arrest him after they saw him toss aside a different gun. The officers, none of whom were hurt, arrested the man without returning fire, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said. &#8220;It showed tremendous restraint on the part of the officers,&#8221; Mr. Kelly said. He said that a police sergeant and two officers saw the man, identified as Nnamdi Clarke, toss the gun shortly before 1 a.m. near 97th Place and 57th Avenue. They chased him, and Mr. Clarke, of Horace Harding Expressway, fired one shot before his weapon jammed, the police said. They said that Mr. Clarke had not yet been charged yesterday evening. The police commissioner said that the suspect had two guns, a .25-caliber automatic and a .32-caliber automatic, as well as several bags of marijuana.

VA federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed against the government by two North Dakota farmers seeking to grow industrial hemp, which can be used to make a variety of products from rope to lotion. The judge, Daniel L. Hovland of United States District Court in Bismarck, said in his ruling on Wednesday that the best remedy might be to change the definition of industrial hemp under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which does not distinguish the plant from the illegal drug marijuana.

V8 P.M. (NBC) RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL'S 75TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL The musty costumes have been placed in storage, the tired dance numbers re-energized and the mold wiped clean from this season's newfangled version of ''The Radio City Christmas Spectacular,'' starring those high-kicking Rockettes, left. Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira are hosts of this hourlong special, which features popular vignettes like ''Parade of the Wooden Soldiers'' and ''The Living Nativity'' as well as sparkling new segments, fireworks, falling snow and a ride into the New York stratosphere in Santa's sleigh. 8 P.M. (HBO) ALPHA DOG (2006) In 2000, a 20-year-old Los Angeles marijuana dealer named Jesse James Hollywood kidnapped, partied with and then ordered the murder of the 15-year-old half-brother of a client who owed him $1,200, prosecutors say. After that he was on the F.B.I.'s most-wanted list for five years until his arrest in Brazil in 2005. In this retelling by Nick Cassavetes, Emile Hirsch plays Johnny Truelove, the dim-bulb mastermind; Bruce Willis is his dad; and Justin Timberlake is Johnny's best friend. Mr. Cassavetes's ''sexed-up, alternately funny and horrifying, heavy-panting exploitation of the crime, despite some name and geography changes, tracks close to the recorded facts,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, adding, ''Do you know where your children are?''

The minister wore all black: jogging pants, basketball sneakers and a T-shirt.

VLEFT-HAND-TURN ELIMINATION [28] It seems that sitting in the left lane, engine idling, waiting for oncoming traffic to clear so you can make a left-hand turn, is minutely wasteful -- of time and peace of mind, for sure, but also of gas and therefore money. Not a ton of gas and money if we're talking about just you and your Windstar, say, but immensely wasteful if we're talking about more than 95,000 big square brown trucks delivering packages every day. And this realization -- that when you operate a gigantic fleet of vehicles, tiny improvements in the efficiency of each one will translate to huge savings overall -- is what led U.P.S. to limit further the number of left-hand turns its drivers make. The company employs what it calls a ''package flow'' software program, which among other hyperefficient practices involving the packing and sorting of its cargo, maps out routes for every one of its drivers, drastically reducing the number of left-hand turns they make (taking into consideration, of course, those instances where not to make the left-hand turn would result in a ridiculously circuitous route).

VTimes Magazine's favorite ideas of 2007 include use of software that packs and sorts packages on UPS trucks and maps out their routes so as to reduce number of left turns drivers will have to make, failed effort to see if energy in lightning can be harnessed in lightning farms, creation of dresses that glow with lasers and light-emitting diodes, discovery that large, upscale house in outlying suburbs is great for growing marijuana indoors, study conducted with hotel maids that found that simply telling people that their everyday work activity amounts to serious exercise can improve their showing on several measures of basic fitness, Konstantin Grcic design of cantilever chair made of new plastic material, New Zealand's use of Web site to solicit suggestions from one and all on rewriting of national policing laws, design of apartment window frame that folds out to become a balcony, questioning of assertions about human behavior that cite brain scans as proof, efforts to reinterpret traditions of 17th- and 18th-century violin making using today's technology and visual aesthetic, and discovery that women do not sit comfortably in office chairs because chairs have generally been designed for men; photos; drawings (L)

VPIXELATED STAINED GLASS In late August, at the unveiling of the massive, awe-inspiring stained-glass window [37] designed by the artist Gerhard Richter for Cologne Cathedral in Germany, the city's conservative archbishop, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, was notably absent. Though Meisner claimed a prior engagement, skeptics suspected otherwise. Meisner had insisted that only a figurative depiction of 20th-century Catholic martyrs could substitute for the original Gothic window, which was destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II and never suitably replaced. Richter, however, delivered something wholly unexpected: an abstract composition of 11,500 identically sized units -- at 14.5 square inches each, they are frequently compared to pixels -- in 72 colors, the arrangement of which was determined randomly by a computer program. Richter originally produced two drafts for the window, each portraying the Nazi execution of innocents. But he ultimately concluded that ''figurative'' was something he simply could not do. ''I was not able to make something of it,'' he says. Any representational image would have been tiresomely dissected for meanings religious, political, symbolic. There were also more mundane reasons. As the cathedral's master builder, Barbara Schock-Werner, writes in a catalog essay for the window, ''How could such a depiction be realized other than in gloomy, oppressive colors?'' This was not a frivolous matter of interior decoration but a practical concern: the prismatic 1,200-square-foot window would bathe the cathedral (and congregation) in a significant amount of light.

VA federal appeals court in San Francisco upheld an 2002 injunction barring three California marijuana clubs from giving the drug to medical patients with a prescription. The ruling by judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit sided with the Justice Department, which first sued the dispensaries in 1998 to stop sales of medical marijuana to patients with a doctor&#8217;s approval, as allowed under a California law approved by voters in 1996. The law has been at the heart of a series of legal battles over state and federal drug laws, which categorize marijuana as illegal. The ruling was likely the last legal recourse for the clubs. In 2001, the United States Supreme Court heard the case and ruled against the California cooperatives.

VAn attempt by Wesley Snipes to shift his tax-evasion trial to New York or Orlando, Fla., was rebuffed in Ocala, Fla., by Judge William T. Hodges of the United States District Court, who ruled that the case would proceed there next month, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Snipes's lawyers argued that he could not get a fair trial in Ocala. He had previously filed two motions to dismiss or transfer the case because of racial prejudice. ... The British singer Amy Winehousehas been summoned to appear on Feb. 29 in a court in Bergen, Norway, to face the consequences of her arrest in October, when she, her husband and her hairdresser were fined for drug use and possession of marijuana. ... A judge in Cleveland freed the rapper Yung Joc on bond after he appeared hours late on Wednesday to face a charge of carrying a concealed weapon at the city's airport, Reuters reported. Yung Joc, whose real name is Jasiel Robinson, is to appear in court on Jan. 25.

VVandals did substantial damage to the farm where Robert Frost summered from 1939 to 1963, The Associated Press reported. The destruction at Homer Noble Farm, above, a national historic landmark, on a dead-end road in Ripton, Vt., was apparently inflicted during an underage drinking party attended by as many as 50 people, said a police sergeant, Lee Hodsden. After breaking a window to gain entry, the intruders demolished tables, chairs, pictures, light fixtures and dishes. They smashed wicker furniture and dressers and burned them in a fireplace, presumably to warm the unheated structure. Sergeant Hodsden said empty beer bottles and cans and cellophane believed to have been used to hold marijuana were also found; two fire extinguishers were also set off inside. He said no arrests had been made, although the police have tracked down some partygoers. The damage was discovered on Saturday by a hiker who notified the police at Middlebury College, which maintains the site. The police said the cabin had last been visited by a caretaker at 10 a.m. on Friday.

VA baby, a toddler and their mothers were shot to death at their Indianapolis home while the women held their children in their arms, the police said. Officers were searching for two men seen running from the home. All four victims were shot repeatedly late Monday, said Assistant Chief Eva Talley-Sanders of the Indianapolis Police Department. The victims were Charlii Yarrell, 4 months; Charlii\u2019s mother, Andrea Yarrell, 24; Jordan Hunt, 23 months; and Jordan\u2019s mother, Gina Hunt, 24. A set of scales, several weapons, a safe and one pound of a what is believed to be marijuana were found in the house, Chief Talley-Sanders said.

VO.K. The presidential race is beginning to move out of the retail politics mode. No more Q. and A. sessions in picturesque community centers. The Republicans are off to Florida, a very large place you just can't woo one town hall after another - although Rudy Giuliani is certainly giving it the old college try.

VAmong the hundreds of proposals contained in Gov. Eliot Spitzer's second executive budget, which he unveiled on Tuesday in Albany, is a provision that would impose a $3.50-a-gram tax on marijuana and a $200-a-gram tax on other illegal drugs, like cocaine.We took a look at the fine print to better understand the details of this legislative proposal -- which, incidentally, is very similar to a proposal that Mayor Edward I. Koch put forward in 1988. (That proposal, to tax illegal drugs in New York City, also at a rate of $200 a gram, did not come to fruition.)

VGov. Eliot Spitzer has agreed to a pay raise for legislators, even as his budget called for strict cuts elsewhere, the Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver has told New York lawmakers. The pay for the state's 212 legislators is now the third-highest in the nation. Their base salary is $79,500, but they can earn more than $100,000 with various bonuses for committee or leadership posts. Their pay has not been increased since 1999. Mr. Spitzer's move underscores the degree to which the once reform-focused governor is taking a more accommodating approach this year after spending much of last year mired in controversy.

V\u201cFrozen River,\u201d a first feature about a struggling single mother in upstate New York who joins a Mohawk widow in smuggling Chinese migrants from Canada into the United States, won the grand jury prize for best American drama on Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, The Associated Press reported. Quentin Tarantino, one of the jurors, described the film, starring Melissa Leo, above right, and Misty Upham, above left, as \u201ca wonderful depiction of poverty in America.\u201d Trade papers reported that Sony Pictures Classics had bought the film, adapted by Courtney Hunt from her 2004 short of the same title, for under $1 million. \u201cTrouble in the Water,\u201d a film by Tia Lessin and Carl Deal about a New Orleans couple\u2019s survival through Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, won the grand jury award in the American documentary category. The audience award for favorite American drama was won by \u201cThe Wackness,\u201d starring Ben Kingsley as a psychiatrist who trades therapy for marijuana.

VThe former national figure skating champion Christopher Bowman died from an accidental drug overdose and an enlarged heart, according to a coroner\u2019s report. Bowman, 40, was found dead on Jan. 10 inside a motel room near Los Angeles. The chief coroner\u2019s investigator, Craig Harvey, said Bowman, a two-time champion, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.12 percent. Harvey said the toxicology tests also showed the presence of cocaine, Valium and marijuana. Also present was the prescription medicine Seroquel, which is used to treat bipolar disorder.

He had just arrived home after taking a red-eye flight from Los Angeles, where he was making the talk-show rounds after making his memorable catch in the Super Bowl.

VA lawyer for Amy Winehouse has asked a court in Norway to postpone a hearing on Friday related to her arrest in October on a charge of drug possession in Bergen, The Associated Press reported. She and her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, were held overnight at the time and released after paying fines of $715 each. She later appealed, contending that the police made mistakes in handling the case, involving a quarter-ounce of marijuana. ... A lawyer for the singer Bobby Brown said a Brockton County District Court clerk magistrate in Massachusetts had found no probable cause to issue a criminal complaint against Mr. Brown, whom the police found in possession of a small amount of cocaine in December. Mr. Brown, formerly married to Whitney Houston, agreed to a year&#8217;s community service, and the lawyer said the matter would be struck from the docket if no problems involving Mr. Brown arise in the next year.

VAmy Winehouse, above left, doesn\u2019t have to worry about a hearing on drug-possession charges in Norway as long as her husband stays in a British jail. That was the essence of a court ruling on Thursday in Bergen, Norway, where the Grammy-winning Ms. Winehouse was scheduled to appear on Friday, Agence France-Presse reported. \u201cOne of the people involved in the case, Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy Winehouse\u2019s husband, is currently in jail in Britain and can\u2019t make the trip,\u201d said Anne Vedvik of the Bergen court. \u201cThe hearing has therefore been postponed to an undetermined date.\u201d Ms. Winehouse, 24, her husband and her hairdresser were arrested in Bergen in October and charged with possessing a quarter-ounce of marijuana. Ms. Winehouse was released after paying a $756 fine, which she later contested. Agreeing to a fine in Norway is equivalent to admitting the charges, which could make it difficult for Ms. Winehouse to obtain visas. Mr. Fielder-Civil has been in custody since November, awaiting trial on charges of assault and conspiracy to pervert the cause of justice. He is accused of trying to bribe a barman not to testify against him in an assault case. ... Boy George, above right, denied on Thursday that he imprisoned a 28-year-old Norwegian man at his London home last year, The Associated Press reported. Appearing in a London court under his real name, George O\u2019Dowd, he pleaded not guilty to a charge of false imprisonment lodged by Audun Carlsen, who claimed that he was handcuffed to a wall after he went to Boy George\u2019s apartment in April as a photo model. Boy George, 46, is free on bail and is to stand trial in November.

VThe revelation that Gov. Eliot Spitzer was a client of a high-end prostitution ring broken up last week by federal authorities has attracted international attention, threatening to end his career and throwing the political world of New York State into chaos. The New York Times, which broke the story on its Web site on Monday afternoon, has three front-page articles explaining the situation.In a main overview, Danny Hakim and William K. Rashbaum review the details of the federal investigation, Mr. Spitzer's terse apology and the shock in Albany. In addition, Mr. Rashbaum explains that the federal inquiry into the prostitution ring began with a routine tax investigation after Mr. Spitzer's bank noticed a series of unusual transactions. Michael Powell and Mike McIntire explore the dizzying rise and fall of Mr. Spitzer's career, an arc that includes a sterling educational pedigree and eight years as a crusading state attorney general.

VThe prolific playwright Horton Foote turns 92 on Friday. In Chicago, where the Goodman Theater is running a Horton Foote Festival of plays, films and discussions through April 6, he is to appear on Monday night in connection with a screening of his films at the theater. ... The Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College, State University of New York, in Purchase, N.Y., plans to open a satellite museum opposite the New York Public Library in early 2009. Under an agreement with the SUNY College of Optometry, the museum will occupy 3,500 to 5,000 square feet of exhibition space on the ground floor of the college&#8217;s building at 33 West 42nd Street . ... Dawn Wells, above, who played the wholesome Mary Ann on &#8220;Gilligan&#8217;s Island,&#8221; is serving six months of unsupervised probation after a sheriff&#8217;s deputy in Idaho arrested her as she was driving home from a surprise birthday party in October, The Associated Press reported. The arresting officer, who described her driving as erratic, said he found half-smoked marijuana joints and two small cases for holding marijuana in the car. Ms. Wells, 69, said she had just given a ride to three hitchhikers and dropped them off when they began smoking. On Feb. 29 she was sentenced to five days in jail, fined $410.50 and placed on probation after pleading guilty to one count of reckless driving. Three misdemeanor counts, including possession of a controlled substance, were dropped.

VDetective Michael Oliver's grand jury testimony, given a year ago, was read aloud on Monday during his manslaughter trial by members of the Queens district attorney's office. It was the closest to a firsthand account of his actions that the public has yet heard. The prosecution has now introduced the grand jury testimony of all three detectives on trial, but the detectives may testify later. When a prosecutor asked if it would have been wiser to seek cover, Detective Oliver replied, "Yes, it would have been the wiser course, but I put myself in harm's way to protect members of my team."

VA friend of Sean Bell's testified on Tuesday that not only did Mr. Bell argue with a stranger outside the Club Kalua the night Mr. Bell was killed, but also that the stranger told Mr. Bell, "I'll shoot you."The testimony followed hours of witnesses over the last 17 days of trial who have turned the exchange in front of Club Kalua into something out of "Rashomon," with everyone seeming to see and hear something different. Accounts have ranged from a heated exchange between Mr. Bell and his friends and the stranger, Fabio Coicou, to a pleasant conversation about their neighborhood, Far Rockaway.

V9 P.M. (ION) PRAIRIE FEVER This new made-for-television film tells the story of a troubled former sheriff (Kevin Sorbo, left) who hasn't stopped drinking since his wife died. He is given a shot at redemption -- and a chance to pay off his debt from his last saloon brawl -- when he's hired to transport three women off the plains and back to civilization. Of course there's a menacing gunman (Lance Henriksen) in the way. The film also stars Jamie Anne Allman, Jillian Armenante, Dominique Swain and Felicia Day. 7 P.M. (Discovery) DOWNLOAD: THE TRUE STORY OF THE INTERNET Shawn Fanning discusses Napster, the program he developed that revolutionized music sharing over the Internet.

VTrent Benefield, a passenger wounded in the police shooting that killed Sean Bell, testified on Monday morning in the trial of three detectives charged in the case that he was shot first in Mr. Bell's back seat and again as he ran away.The testimony from Mr. Benefield, 24, appeared to contradict the grand jury testimony of the detectives, none of whom have said they shot at him as he ran away. Mr. Benefield said he was first shot in both calves in the back seat.

V9 P.M. (13) MY BOY JACK Daniel Radcliffe (left with Kim Cattrall), moves out of the shadow of Harry Potter and into the role of Rudyard Kipling's son in this ''Masterpiece'' adaptation of the play by David Haig. Mr. Radcliffe plays Jack Kipling, who, under age, cursed with poor eyesight and sharing his father's belief in the power of war, desperately longs to join the fight at the outbreak of World War I. After Jack fails his induction eye exam twice, his father uses his influence to gain his son, not yet 18, an officer's commission in the Irish Guards. And then, in the Battle of Loos, Jack goes missing. Mr. Haig plays Rudyard Kipling; Ms. Cattrall is his American wife, Carrie. 1 P.M. (G4) HALF BAKED G4 goes up in smoke for the day with programming extolling the virtues of cannabis culture, beginning at 1 p.m. First, this comedy starring Dave Chappelle, Guillermo Díaz and Jim Breuer as party guys hatching a scheme to bail a friend out of jail. Other highlights include ''Attack of the Show: Jamaica,'' at 3, which reports on the state of marijuana consumption in Toronto, Vancouver, Los Angeles and San Francisco; ''Code Monkeys: The Story of 420,'' at 5; the cult classic ''Reefer Madness,'' tweaked with new characters and voices in ''Reefee's Madhouse,'' at 6; and at 7, the best scenes from the Troma horror flick ''Class of Nuke 'em High'' in ''Grindcore.''

VBrian Bassett, a guest blogger for the Fifth Down this week, writes for TheJetsBlog, a blog partner with Sports Net New York.The draft only recently became the glitzy production with which many of us are now so familiar. The NFL has picked up on the draft as a crucial bridge for fans to pass time during the longest dormant period of any major sport. For football fans, it represents the possibility of redemption.

VThe number of people arrested for small amounts of marijuana in New York City has increased tenfold in the past decade, with most of the arrests occurring after the police either searched suspects or pressured them into emptying their bags or pockets and displaying the drug during a stop-and-frisk, a report [pdf] said on Tuesday.The report, released by the New York Civil Liberties Union, was based on government statistics, interviews with lawyers, people who were arrested, and former and current law enforcement officials. The civil liberties group also took into account observations in criminal court. A Police Department spokesman criticized the findings as flawed.

VA state appeals court ruled on Tuesday that the Port Authority was liable for damages caused by the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, because it knew about but chose to ignore "an extreme and potentially catastrophic vulnerability that would have been open and obvious to any terrorist who cared to investigate and exploit it."The ruling unanimously upheld a jury's verdict that the agency was 68 percent liable for the bombing and the terrorists were 32 percent liable. In its decision, the court noted that the Port Authority, a bistate New York and New Jersey agency that owned the trade center, did not argue that the bombing was unforeseeable, only that it was unlikely, since its own consultants and an internal study group had predicted "with exact prescience" how an attack could be carried out. Under state rules, because the Port Authority's liability was more than 50 percent, it can be forced to pay all the damages to injured survivors and to relatives of those who were killed.

VModern life entails a lot of numerical noise: An eye-glazing plethora of statistics and metrics and codes and calculations are blizzarded over us all on any given day, and sometimes it can overwhelm the little filter in our brains that is supposed to warn us when a number we encounter is just too far out to make sense.
